class AlgorithmofThought(BaseScheme):
    """
    Algorithm of Thoughts
    ---------------------

    This class implements the Algorithm of Thoughts (AoT) algorithm. AoT is a
    general-purpose algorithm for solving problems. It is inspired by the
    human thought process and is based on the idea of generating thoughts and
    evaluating them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_thoughts : int
        The number of thoughts to generate at each step of the algorithm.
    max_steps : int
        The maximum number of steps to run the algorithm for.
    value_threshold : float
        The minimum value of a thought to be considered valid.
    pruning_threshold : float
        The minimum value of a thought to be considered for caching.
    backtracking_threshold : float
        The minimum value of a thought to be considered for backtracking.
    initial_prompt : str
        The initial prompt to start the algorithm with.
    openai_api_key : str
        The OpenAI API key to use for the algorithm.
    thought_cache : dict
        The cache to use for the algorithm.

    Returns
    -------
    solution : str
        The solution to the problem.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from aot.main import AoT
    >>> system = "
    ... Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. When
    ... considering the next steps, do not choose operations that will result in a
    ... negative or fractional number. In order to help with the calculations, the
    ... numbers in the parenthesis represent the numbers that are left after the
    ... operations and they are in descending order.
    ... Another thing we do is when there are only two numbers left in the parenthesis, we
    ... check whether we can arrive at 24 only by using basic arithmetic operations
    ... (+ - * /). Some examples regarding this idea:
    ... (21 2) no
    ... since 21 + 2 = 23, 21 - 2 = 19, 21 * 2 = 42, 21 / 2 = 10.5, none of which is equal
    ... to 24.
    ... (30 6) 30 - 6 = 24 yes
    ... (8 3) 8 * 3 = 24 yes
    ... (12 8) no
    ... (48 2) 48 / 2 = 24 yes
