<Instruction> Merge the following two lists by appending the second list to the first, then sort the combined list in ascending order.
Only output the final list without any additional text or thoughts!
** Do not use json format ** </Instruction>

<Steps>
1. Copy all numbers from List 1, preserving their order.  
2. Append all numbers from List 2 in their original order.  
3. Sort the resulting list in ascending numeric order.  
4. Output ONLY the sorted list (one line, no extra text, no thoughts).
</Steps>


<Examples>
List 1: [37, 29, 7]
List 2: []
<!-- 1. Append []  → [37, 29, 7]
     2. Sort asc  → [7, 29, 37] -->
Output: [7, 29, 37]

List 1: [5, 7, 3, 32, 15, 27]
List 2: [11, 0, 23, 8]
<!-- 1. Append → [5, 7, 3, 32, 15, 27, 11, 0, 23, 8]
     2. Sort   → [0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 15, 23, 27, 32] -->
Output: [0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 15, 23, 27, 32]
</Examples>

List 1: {input_list1}
List 2: {input_list2}

Let's think step by step.
