He aimed to explore the biodiversity of Brazil, especially the bird species endemic to the region. His trip to Brazil was an eye-opener as he marveled at the varied and vibrant birds he saw, some of which were critically endangered. After a successful expedition in Brazil, his next stop was Australia. He was thrilled to observe the distinctive bird species in Australia, such as the Emu and the Kookaburra, that make Australia a paradise for bird watchers. Australia, he discovered, also had a significant number of migratory birds that added to its rich diversity. His next destination was South Africa, a country known for its unique fauna. He spent several days in South Africa, amazed by the incredible diversity and uniqueness of its bird species.",
