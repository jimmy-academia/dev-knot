His fascination grew so much that he decided to share his experiences with his childhood friend, Lucy, who was living in the United States. Lucy, intrigued by John's experiences in Australia, shared stories of her own travels to Mexico. Mexico, she said, was a country rich in history, boasting enigmatic pyramids and ancient civilizations that rivalled even those of Egypt. She recounted her adventures in Mexico, detailing the vibrant colors, the cuisine, and the generosity of the locals she had encountered. This conversation led John to recall his journey to Russia, where he had been especially fascinated by the grand palaces and the resilient spirit of the local people.",
