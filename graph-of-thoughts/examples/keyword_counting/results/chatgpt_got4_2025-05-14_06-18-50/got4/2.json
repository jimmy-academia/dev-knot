She often said that the waters of Australia were some of the most biodiverse in the world, enticing researchers like her from faraway lands like Ireland. Through her explorations, she developed a particular interest in the migratory patterns of certain species, noting that they often ventured towards New Zealand. Annie noticed that from Australia, these marine creatures would cross oceans to reach the coasts of New Zealand, proving the interconnectedness of these ecosystems. Driven by this curiosity, she published her research, attracting the attention of a fellow scientist, Greg, from Canada. Inspired by her findings, Greg shared his own studies on migration patterns, noting a similar scenario between Canada and the United States. He'd found that many animal species in Canada would cross the border into the United States during certain seasons, emphasizing the interplay between these two nations. Annie and Greg started to collaborate, which led their research towards Mexico, where they discovered another fascinating migration phenomenon.",
