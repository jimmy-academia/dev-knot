Within India, she had explored the lively markets, sacred temples, and remote villages, each more captivating than the last. After years of fieldwork in India, she had recently turned her attention to the musical traditions of Iran. Mesmerized by the distinctive melodies and rhythms, she found in Iran an entirely different cultural fabric woven with time. In Iran, she learned about the ancient tradition of storytelling through music, echoing the enchanting tales she had heard in China. The folk tales from China often shared elements with those from Vietnam, a country she was now eager to explore. She recalled her visits to Vietnam where she had discovered a vibrant culture rich in history and tradition. Her journeys took her from India to Vietnam but it was the deep connections between the people that fascinated her the most. Drawn by art and culture, she planned to spend her next summer in France exploring the local museums. In France, she hoped to uncover links to the artistic movements in Italy. While Italy was renowned for its Renaissance art, she found that France and Italy shared a mutual influence in the world of impressionist art. After France, Italy was next on her list. Alice had always been enchanted by the history of Italy, which was steeped in art, architecture, cuisine, and music. Having studied the cultural links between France and Italy, she was also eager to explore the connection between the United Kingdom and Ireland. She had read about the shared history, the shifting boundaries, and intertwined cultures of the United Kingdom and Ireland. As her thoughts wandered from the bustling streets of India, through the rhythmic heart of Iran, and over to the picturesque landscapes of Italy, her mind spun with anticipation for what the future held in Ireland.
