He was particularly interested in the historical ties between the United Kingdom and Ireland, how the two countries, despite their conflicted history, had shared traditions, myths, and legends. Inspired by these narratives, he wrote to his friend Rosa in Mexico, telling her about his research. Rosa, a linguistics expert, was intrigued and wrote back about the rich history of Mexico and the indigenous cultures that shaped the country. She also spoke about the vibrant traditions indigenous to Mexico and Peru, and how both Mexico and Peru had a shared history of ancient civilizations, with languages, rituals, and architecture that had a profound influence on their respective societies. She then shared about her trip to Russia, which she found so diverse and captivating. The historian in James was excited by the detailed descriptions Rosa gave about Russia and Ukraine, about their shared history, the influence of the Byzantine Empire, and the development of Cyrillic script. He then reminisced about his visit to South Africa where he explored the local folktales. He mentioned how South Africa and Zimbabwe's stories were intertwined, with themes of resilience and liberation echoing through their histories. Rosa responded, sharing her fascination with Japan and its unique cultural heritage. She wrote about Japan and South Korea, their shared past, cultural exchanges, and how they had influenced each other's art and literature. They both concluded that the fascinating journeys of these countries, from the United Kingdom to South Korea, suggested a world much more interconnected than generally perceived.",
