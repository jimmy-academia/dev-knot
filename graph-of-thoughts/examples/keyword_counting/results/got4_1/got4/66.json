Mexico, he explained, was home to ancient civilizations whose remnants were still visible in the form of grand pyramids and intricate carvings. After Mexico, he turned the discussion towards Italy, and the architectural marvels that stand in testament to their centuries-old history. The Roman coliseum and the tower of Pisa were favorite examples when discussing Italy, he said, as they represent different periods and styles prevalent in Italy. He also touched upon Iran, describing how the country's rich history is evident in its architecture, from the elaborate mosques to the ancient city of Persepolis. Iran, he said, was a treasure trove for historians and architects alike, offering insights into the glorious past of Persia. As the lecture advanced, he started talking about Egypt and its awe-inspiring pyramids. Egypt, he said, was a living museum with countless artifacts and structures that had survived thousands of years. Stepping outside architecture, Jack described a trip to South Korea, where he had explored the technological advancements of the country. He explained how South Korea was on the cutting edge of technology, with high-speed internet and tech giants that were globally recognized. South Korea, he held, was a testament to how technology could drive development. Towards the end, Ireland was brought up, as he detailed how the country's landscapes and traditions were equally captivating. Ireland, he stated, was an enchanting blend of history and natural beauty, with its numerous castles and lush green landscapes. The students left the class, minds brimming with stories of Mexico to Ireland, eager to see the world's wonders firsthand.",

Mexico, he explained, was home to ancient civilizations whose remnants were still visible in the form of grand pyramids and intricate carvings. After Mexico, he turned the discussion towards Italy, and the architectural marvels that stand in testament to their centuries-old history. The Roman coliseum and the tower of Pisa were favorite examples when discussing Italy, he said, as they represent different periods and styles prevalent in Italy. He also touched upon Iran, describing how the country's rich history is evident in its architecture, from the elaborate mosques to the ancient city of Persepolis. Iran, he said, was a treasure trove for historians and architects alike, offering insights into the glorious past of Persia. As the lecture advanced, he started talking about Egypt and its awe-inspiring pyramids. Egypt, he said, was a living museum with countless artifacts and structures that had survived thousands of years. Stepping outside architecture, Jack described a trip to South Korea, where he had explored the technological advancements of the country. He explained how South Korea was on the cutting edge of technology, with high-speed internet and tech giants that were globally recognized. South Korea, he held, was a testament to how technology could drive development. Towards the end, Ireland was brought up, as he detailed how the country's landscapes and traditions were equally captivating. Ireland, he stated, was an enchanting blend of history and natural beauty, with its numerous castles and lush green landscapes. The students left the class, minds brimming with stories of Mexico to Ireland, eager to see the world's wonders firsthand.",

Mexico, he explained, was home to ancient civilizations whose remnants were still visible in the form of grand pyramids and intricate carvings.After Mexico, he turned the discussion towards Italy, and the architectural marvels that stand in testament to their centuries-old history. The Roman coliseum and the tower of Pisa were favorite examples when discussing Italy, he said, as they represent different periods and styles prevalent in Italy. He also touched upon Iran, describing how the country's rich history is evident in its architecture, from the elaborate mosques to the ancient city of Persepolis.Iran, he said, was a treasure trove for historians and architects alike, offering insights into the glorious past of Persia. As the lecture advanced, he started talking about Egypt and its awe-inspiring pyramids. Egypt, he said, was a living museum with countless artifacts and structures that had survived thousands of years. Stepping outside architecture, Jack described a trip to South Korea, where he had explored the technological advancements of the country.He explained how South Korea was on the cutting edge of technology, with high-speed internet and tech giants that were globally recognized. South Korea, he held, was a testament to how technology could drive development. Towards the end, Ireland was brought up, as he detailed how the country's landscapes and traditions were equally captivating. Ireland, he stated, was an enchanting blend of history and natural beauty, with its numerous castles and lush green landscapes.",
