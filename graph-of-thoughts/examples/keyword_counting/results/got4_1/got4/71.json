He found himself deeply immersed in researching the bond between North Korea and South Korea, noting that despite their political divide, shared history still tied them together. He discussed his findings with his colleague Lisa, who had an expertise in tracing the historical links between India and Pakistan. Both India and Pakistan share a similar language, culture, and history, suggesting traces of a shared past despite their political differences. These shared elements in culture and history also reminded John of the complex relationship between the United States and Canada. A shared border and common language allowed the United States and Canada to collaborate in various sectors like trade, technology, and arts. Lisa brought up her recent trip to Australia and New Zealand, and their unique relationship, sharing histories of colonialism, indigenous cultures, and a fierce sporting rivalry. She found the bonds Australia and New Zealand shared were reminiscent of the ties between Belgium and the Netherlands, two countries she explored during her sabbatical. Belgium and Netherlands, both located in Western Europe, share a rich history of trade, art, and cultural exchange. They concluded their discussion by drawing parallels with South America, particularly the close alliance and shared cultural history between Argentina and Brazil. They marveled at how interconnected these countries were, from North Korea to Brazil, illustrating the intricate web of shared histories and cultural exchanges across the globe.",
