He read voraciously about these warriors from Japan, their rigorous discipline, and their peculiar code of honor. Inspired, he decided to learn more about martial arts and ended up in South Korea, enrolling in a Taekwondo academy. Spending years in South Korea, he noticed parallels between the samurai culture of Japan and the martial philosophy of South Korea. His time in Asia also exposed him to the rich spiritual traditions of India. He was particularly intrigued by yoga from India, which he found to be a potent combination of physical discipline and mental concentration. On his return to the western hemisphere, he met Maria in Peru, who had a similar passion for spirituality and mysticism. She enlightened him about the Inca civilization of Peru and its unique spiritual practices. Intrigued by the Inca civilization, John became fascinated with the Mayan civilization of Mexico. He read books about Mexico, about its ancient pyramids and astronomical knowledge. Maria, inspired by John's interest in ancient civilizations, shared her experiences of visiting the pyramids in Egypt. She described Egypt with such passion that John decided to plan his next adventure there. In Egypt, he found connections with Peru and Mexico, each bound by their ancient civilizations. Through their travels, Maria and John realized how interconnected the world is, from the samurais of Japan to the pyramids of Egypt, and it only deepened their passion for exploration and learning.",
