She loved reading about how scholars from Greece and Egypt exchanged ideas, contributing to the foundation of philosophical and mathematical thoughts. Alice, who was from the United States, had a longtime friend, Ying, from China. Ying, who studied ancient arts, was particularly interested in the historical links between China and Japan. She explained that the cultural exchanges between China and Japan had fostered a significant development in arts, religions, philosophy, and social organizations. It was evident that Alice and Ying shared a profound interest in the historical connections between countries. Alice, fondly reminiscing about her trip to Australia, mentioned its curious connection with New Zealand. She mentioned how Australia and New Zealand shared a similar culture and history, with both being colonies of the United Kingdom. Ying, reminded of her visit to South Korea, shared how she learned about the deep cultural and historical connections between North Korea and South Korea. Despite the current political divide, there was undeniable shared heritage and history between North Korea and South Korea. Both excitedly shared stories about their visit to Europe, Alice had been to Ireland and Ying had visited Poland. Alice brightened up talking about the shared culture of Ireland and the United Kingdom, while Ying shared her fascination with the rich history and cultural ties between Poland and Ukraine. As they connected these dots, they found themselves growing more passionate about history and decided to plan a trip to explore more connections around the world.",
