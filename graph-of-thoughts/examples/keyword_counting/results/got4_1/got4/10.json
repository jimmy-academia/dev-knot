The vast, arid landscapes of Australia presented a stark contrast to the snow-filled winters of his home in Canada, and he reveled in the difference. He then shared stories of his trip to Brazil, where he fell in love with the vibrant rhythms and the people's warm hospitality. Indeed, Brazil left such a strong impression on him that he visited the country again, this time to explore the dense Amazon rainforest. As John recounted his travels, his friend Sarah, a history buff from the United Kingdom, couldn't help but gush about her trips to Italy and Greece. She explained how she had spent weeks soaking up the culture, history, and mythology of Italy and Greece. Intrigued by Sarah's stories, John revealed his fascination for Northern countries, particularly Norway and Sweden. He cherished his memories of hiking through the scenic landscapes of Norway and the breathtaking fjords of Sweden. Sarah, not to be outdone, discussed her recent visit to Mexico and Cuba. Highlighting the unique colonial architecture of Mexico and the vibrant music scene in Cuba, Sarah couldn't conceal her wanderlust. She ended the conversation by expressing her desire to visit South Korea and Japan. She was particularly interested in the modern cities and ancient temples of South Korea, as well as the unique blend of tradition and technology in Japan. As they parted ways, both agreed to continue exploring and understanding the world, one country at a time.",
