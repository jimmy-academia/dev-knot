He discovered that Argentina and Brazil had a long-standing relationship, marked by cultural exchanges, shared regional cuisine, and a fervent football rivalry. From South America, he made his way to the Middle East, where he was drawn to the historical sites of Iran. He spent a few days in Iran, exploring the ancient cities and learning about the country's many cultural layers, which he found were equally respected and mirrored in neighboring Iraq. Next, he traveled to Ireland, a country known for its lush landscapes and rich folklore that reminded him of the verdant hills and vibrant culture of its neighbour, the United Kingdom. Struck by the similarities, he found that Ireland and the United Kingdom shared deep historical ties, language influences, and even traditional music. After Ireland, he ventured into the heart of Europe, finding himself in the charming lanes of Belgium. The intricate architecture and delicate cuisine of Belgium enticed him, and they seemed all the more familiar when he moved on to the Netherlands. He learned that Belgium and the Netherlands had shared monarchies and currencies in the past, highlighting a linked history. From there, his journey took him halfway across the globe to South Korea. The bustling cities and fascinating traditions of South Korea captivated him, and he noticed many similarities when he crossed the border into North Korea. Despite the political differences, he found cultural threads that connected South Korea and North Korea, from food to language.
