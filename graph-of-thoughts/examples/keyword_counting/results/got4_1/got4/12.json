He spent considerable time studying how Egypt had shaped the thought processes, cultural practices, and literary works of Greece. His colleague, Laura from Argentina, invited him to visit Argentina and Brazil, since these countries also had rich historical relations. Indeed, Argentina had been greatly influenced by the immigrants from Brazil who had shaped its local culture and traditions. She also spoke of North Korea and South Korea, two oddly paired countries that had multiple common threads in their history. Despite being seen as adversaries, North Korea and South Korea shared a lot of similarities linguistically and culturally. On the other hand, John shared his recent research on India and China, the two enigmatic giants of Asia. He described how India had been swayed by the powerful cultural and historical waves from China over centuries. Both India and China, he narrated, had a long history of philosophical exchanges and cultural learnings. They further discussed Australia and its unusual connections with New Zealand. Both Australia and New Zealand shared a unique bond in terms of natural heritage and sports. The lively chat shifted to Europe, with Laura speaking about her visit to Poland and Ukraine. Laura shared her experiences in Poland and Ukraine which, despite their complicated historical relations, had strong cultural links.
