        "original": "Once, on a voyage from Argentina to Australia, Captain Fredericks discovered links between these two countries based on the indigenous art forms. The indigenous people of Argentina and Australia, as he noted, shared similar creation stories depicting a great serpent, which was fascinating. Later, he journeyed to the cold regions of Canada and found evidence of ancient trade links with Russia. He unearthed artifacts in Canada that traced back to Russia, suggesting a deep historical connection between these distant lands. This discovery reminded him of the time he spent in China, where he chanced upon cultural parallels with its neighbor, North Korea. China and North Korea, though politically distinct, seem to share a lot in common in terms of their folklore and traditional practices. This sparked his interest in the connectivity of cultures and he decided to visit Egypt, with its long and rich history. Fredericks found astonishing similarities between the ancient civilizations of Egypt and Iraq. Both Egypt and Iraq, he found, possessed complex structures and writing systems that have baffled historians for centuries. These findings led him to his next destination, the colorful land of India, where he found intriguing links with its neighbour, Pakistan. India and Pakistan, despite their bitter history, had much in common culturally speaking, from their cuisine to their shared history of colonial rule. On his return, he stopped by in Spain, where he met scholars who spoke about the shared history of Spain and Portugal. Both Spain and Portugal, having been great maritime powers, left their mark on many parts of the world. Finally, he landed in the United States, where he decided to pen down his travels, highlighting the surprising bonds countries share, from Argentina to the United States.",
