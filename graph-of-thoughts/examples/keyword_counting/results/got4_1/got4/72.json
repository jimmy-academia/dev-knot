The book elaborated how despite their disagreements, Portugal and Spain had a shared heritage that was hard to ignore. Her friend Ben, who had lived in both Spain and Portugal, often spoke about the shared traditions and culture that overpowered their differences. Their discussion then shifted to the exotic travel stories of Ben who had recently returned from a trip to China. He spoke about the beautiful landscapes, bustling cities, and enchanting history of China, and how it beautifully contrasted with its neighboring country, Vietnam. The elegance of China and the charm of Vietnam had left a profound impact on him. He also mentioned how Vietnam and China, despite their past conflicts, shared a deep cultural bond. Ben's travel stories reminded Alice of her friend Claire who had recently moved to Canada. Claire had spoken at length about the differences between Canada and the United States; how the two countries, while very close geographically and often compared to one another, had very distinct identities. She shared stories about her experiences in both Canada and the United States, highlighting the unique cultural facets of each nation. Intrigued by such narratives, Alice too expressed her desire to explore these countries. After a day filled with tales from Spain to the United States, they walked out of the coffee shop with a newfound appreciation for the world's diverse cultures and histories.",

Her friend Ben, who had lived in both Spain and Portugal, often spoke about the shared traditions and culture that overpowered their differences. Their discussion then shifted to the exotic travel stories of Ben who had recently returned from a trip to China. He spoke about the beautiful landscapes, bustling cities, and enchanting history of China, and how it beautifully contrasted with its neighboring country, Vietnam. The elegance of China and the charm of Vietnam had left a profound impact on him. He also mentioned how Vietnam and China, despite their past conflicts, shared a deep cultural bond. Ben's travel stories reminded Alice of her friend Claire who had recently moved to Canada. Claire had spoken at length about the differences between Canada and the United States; how the two countries, while very close geographically and often compared to one another, had very distinct identities. She shared stories about her experiences in both Canada and the United States, highlighting the unique cultural facets of each nation.
