As per her research, the artifacts that were found in Norway were identical to those in Sweden, indicating a deep-rooted cultural connection between Sweden and Norway. This piqued the interest of her colleague, James, who was from Canada. He had been researching the indigenous tribes of Canada and found many similarities with tribes from his neighboring country, the United States. James had always been interested in the historical ties between Canada and United States, and his study further confirmed the age-old connections between the two countries. Upon hearing James's story, Sarah shared a fascinating anecdote from her travels in Portugal. She recalled how locals loved to tell the tale of the shared history between Spain and Portugal. Her anecdotes about Spain and Portugal echoed the same sense of shared culture and past, just like in the case of Norway and Sweden, and Canada and United States. Their conversation reminded James of his stay in South Korea, where he had learned about the close relationship between North Korea and South Korea, despite their current political divide. He recalled stories about the shared history of North Korea and South Korea, whose deep-seated cultural ties transcended political boundaries. Sarah, who had been to Australia, reciprocated with her own experiences of the bond between Australia and New Zealand. She described how, despite geographical separation, Australia and New Zealand shared a unique camaraderie and close historical ties. As they exchanged stories, their conversation moved to South Africa and its various connections with its neighbouring country, Zimbabwe. Sarah shared stories she had heard about the intricate bond between South Africa and Zimbabwe, showcasing the age-old interactions between these two nations.
