He had taken a particular interest in the ancient Mayan civilization, which once flourished in Mexico and whose influence could still be seen in the country's architecture and traditions. While in Mexico, he had also discovered a shared history with Peru, where Mayan traders were believed to have ventured for trade. By studying the artifacts and tales in Peru, John was able to see a reflection of Mexico's bygone era. His adventures in Mexico and Peru fueled his interest in indigenous cultures, leading him to plan a trip to Canada. His journey to Canada introduced him to the rich and colourful traditions of the First Nations. In Canada, he found echoes of Australia's own native tribes, reinforcing his belief in the interconnectedness of cultures. His exploration in Canada led him to learn about the country's historical ties with the United Kingdom. Having spent a year in the United Kingdom earlier, he couldn't help but see the shared patterns of history, architecture, and societal structures between Canada and the United Kingdom. The following year, he decided to explore Asia, starting with South Korea. He was taken by the technological advancements in South Korea, a stark contrast to the traditional cultures he had been studying. South Korea fascinated him with its unique blend of tradition and modernity, reminding him of his own hometown in Australia. The urban fabric of South Korea, he thought, was reminiscent of the United Kingdom's bustling cities. His travels didn't stop there, as he ventured to India, drawn by its rich history and diversity. He found that, much like Australia, India was a melting pot of cultures, languages, and traditions, just with a different flavor.

He had taken a particular interest in the ancient Mayan civilization, which once flourished in Mexico and whose influence could still be seen in the country's architecture and traditions. While in Mexico, he had also discovered a shared history with Peru, where Mayan traders were believed to have ventured for trade. By studying the artifacts and tales in Peru, John was able to see a reflection of Mexico's bygone era.His adventures in Mexico and Peru fueled his interest in indigenous cultures, leading him to plan a trip to Canada. His journey to Canada introduced him to the rich and colourful traditions of the First Nations. In Canada, he found echoes of Australia's own native tribes, reinforcing his belief in the interconnectedness of cultures. His exploration in Canada led him to learn about the country's historical ties with the United Kingdom. Having spent a year in the United Kingdom earlier, he couldn't help but see the shared patterns of history, architecture, and societal structures between Canada and the United Kingdom.The following year, he decided to explore Asia, starting with South Korea. He was taken by the technological advancements in South Korea, a stark contrast to the traditional cultures he had been studying. South Korea fascinated him with its unique blend of tradition and modernity, reminding him of his own hometown in Australia. The urban fabric of South Korea, he thought, was reminiscent of the United Kingdom's bustling cities. His travels didn't stop there, as he ventured to India, drawn by its rich history and diversity.He found that, much like Australia, India was a melting pot of cultures, languages, and traditions, just with a different flavor.
