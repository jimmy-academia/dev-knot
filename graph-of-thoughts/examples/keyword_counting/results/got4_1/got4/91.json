Oliver, the anthropologist, regaled them with tales from Brazil. He spoke about Brazil's wildlife, the Amazon rainforest, its indigenous cultures, and the sense of adventure the country offered. From Brazil, the conversation moved to Argentina, discussing the country's rich history, from its colonial past to a thriving nation today. Argentina, they mused, had as much charm as Brazil, with a unique blend of European influences alongside indigenous traditions. Grace, who studied linguistics, shared her recent journey to China and the deep immersion she had experienced into the Mandarin language there. She also recalled the ancient history of China and how it still influences modern China in many ways. Grace's twin, Hannah, spoke excitedly about her recent trip to Japan. She recounted how Japan was a country that seemed to effortlessly blend traditional cultures with ultra-modern technology. Japan, she said, was a country where one could feel a deep sense of spirituality amidst neon-lit cities. As the night grew older, the friends reflected on their shared trip to India, where they had experienced a stunning array of cultures, cuisines and landscapes. They reminisced about India's architectural marvels, the warmth of its people and the mystic allure of its spirituality. Towards the end of the evening, they found themselves talking about their dream destinations, and Italy was a unanimous choice. They all shared a collective dream of experiencing Italy's rich history, exquisite cuisine, and the romance that the country promised.

Japan, she said, was a country where one could feel a deep sense of spirituality amidst neon-lit cities.

From Brazil, the conversation moved to Argentina, discussing the country's rich history, from its colonial past to a thriving nation today. Argentina, they mused, had as much charm as Brazil, with a unique blend of European influences alongside indigenous traditions. Grace, who studied linguistics, shared her recent journey to China and the deep immersion she had experienced into the Mandarin language there. She also recalled the ancient history of China and how it still influences modern China in many ways. Grace's twin, Hannah, spoke excitedly about her recent trip to Japan. She recounted how Japan was a country that seemed to effortlessly blend traditional cultures with ultra-modern technology. Japan, she said, was a country where one could feel a deep sense of spirituality amidst neon-lit cities. As the night grew older, the friends reflected on their shared trip to India, where they had experienced a stunning array of cultures, cuisines and landscapes. They reminisced about India's architectural marvels, the warmth of its people and the mystic allure of its spirituality. Towards the end of the evening, they found themselves talking about their dream destinations, and Italy was a unanimous choice.
