She specialized in the medieval age, focusing particularly on the cross-cultural influences between France and Spain at the time. These nations shared a border and a rich, intertwined history, filled with wars, alliances, and cultural exchange. Her work in France led her to the involvement of another country, Italy, in this historic web. She launched an expedition to Italy, hoping to uncover clues about Italy's relation with Spain in the past. There, she discovered the influence of Italy on Spain's art and architecture during the Renaissance period. Alice's fascination with history drove her from Europe to the Middle East, focusing on the ancient civilizations of Iraq and Iran. She uncovered that Iraq and Iran, despite their modern political differences, share a vast historical connection dating back thousands of years. The Persian Empire, centered in Iran, and the Mesopotamian civilizations, centered in Iraq, had left indelible marks on each other. Alice's research also took her to East Asia, specifically to China and Japan. Alice was captivated by China's ancient dynasties and their influence on Japan through Buddhism and Confucianism. Her investigation revealed that China and Japan had a complex relationship spanning centuries, shaped by the exchange of ideas, trade, and occasional conflicts. Inspired by her findings, Alice decided to delve into the history of North and South America, focusing particularly on Mexico and the United States. She learned that Mexico and the United States shared a layered history, marked by conflicts, treaties, and profound cultural exchanges. The captivating tales of France, Spain, Italy, Iraq, Iran, China, Japan, Mexico, and the United States sparked an unforgettable journey across the globe for Alice, deepening her appreciation for the interconnectedness of the world's history.",

She specialized in the medieval age, focusing particularly on the cross-cultural influences between France and Spain at the time. These nations shared a border and a rich, intertwined history, filled with wars, alliances, and cultural exchange. Her work in France led her to the involvement of another country, Italy, in this historic web. She launched an expedition to Italy, hoping to uncover clues about Italy's relation with Spain in the past. There, she discovered the influence of Italy on Spain's art and architecture during the Renaissance period. Alice's fascination with history drove her from Europe to the Middle East, focusing on the ancient civilizations of Iraq and Iran. She uncovered that Iraq and Iran, despite their modern political differences, share a vast historical connection dating back thousands of years. The Persian Empire, centered in Iran, and the Mesopotamian civilizations, centered in Iraq, had left indelible marks on each other. Alice's research also took her to East Asia, specifically to China and Japan. Alice was captivated by China's ancient dynasties and their influence on Japan through Buddhism and Confucianism. Her investigation revealed that China and Japan had a complex relationship spanning centuries, shaped by the exchange of ideas, trade, and occasional conflicts.
