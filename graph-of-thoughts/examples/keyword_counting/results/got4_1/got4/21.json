Intrigued by her findings, her colleague David, a history enthusiast from Canada, stressed upon a similar historical connection between Canada and the United States. He explained that despite being two separate nations today, Canada and the United States share a common history of colonial times and have closely influenced each other's cultural development. Emma further shared her experience of visiting the breath-taking ruins of ancient Rome in Italy, where she had found scrolls mentioning strong trade relations between Italy and Spain. These scrolls showed that during the Roman era, Italy and Spain had a strong bond based on mutual respect and trade.
