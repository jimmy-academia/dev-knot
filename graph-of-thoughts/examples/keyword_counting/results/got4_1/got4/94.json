        "original": "As a diplomat from the United States, Michael had the opportunity to travel widely and learn about the intricacies of global politics. Striking up a conversation with a fellow diplomat from Canada at a summit in New York, he learned about the nuanced relationship between the United States and Canada; how they shared not only a border, but a multitude of cultural and economic ties. He was fascinated by the unique dynamics between Australia and New Zealand as well, as he had recently been posted there. Being neighboring countries, Australia and New Zealand shared a deep bond cultivated over the years through a shared history, culture, and friendly competition. This stirred his interest in similar dynamics between other nations such as South Korea and North Korea. Despite their political differences, the shared history and culture between South Korea and North Korea is undeniably profound. He then recalled his previous posting in Iran, where he had learned a lot about its complex relationship with Iraq. The adversities and struggles between Iran and Iraq had shaped their histories in the most significant of ways. His thoughts shifted towards Europe, particularly Norway and Sweden. He had always been inspired by the peaceful co-existence of Norway and Sweden, two nations known for their progressive societies. When he returned to the United States, he remembered his interactions with diplomats from Mexico and how they often discussed underlying bonds and issues between the United States and Mexico. Both the United States and Mexico had strong economic ties and a shared border, along with a history filled with conflict and cooperation. Little did he know that a career in diplomacy would offer him such a deep understanding of how interconnected the world truly is, from the United States to Sweden, Mexico to Norway, and beyond.",

Striking up a conversation with a fellow diplomat from Canada at a summit in New York, he learned about the nuanced relationship between the United States and Canada; how they shared not only a border, but a multitude of cultural and economic ties. He was fascinated by the unique dynamics between Australia and New Zealand as well, as he had recently been posted there. Being neighboring countries, Australia and New Zealand shared a deep bond cultivated over the years through a shared history, culture, and friendly competition. This stirred his interest in similar dynamics between other nations such as South Korea and North Korea. Despite their political differences, the shared history and culture between South Korea and North Korea is undeniably profound. He then recalled his previous posting in Iran, where he had learned a lot about its complex relationship with Iraq. The adversities and struggles between Iran and Iraq had shaped their histories in the most significant of ways. His thoughts shifted towards Europe, particularly Norway and Sweden. He had always been inspired by the peaceful co-existence of Norway and Sweden, two nations known for their progressive societies. When he returned to the United States, he remembered his interactions with diplomats from Mexico and how they often discussed underlying bonds and issues between the United States and Mexico. Both the United States and Mexico had strong economic ties and a shared border, along with a history filled with conflict and cooperation.
