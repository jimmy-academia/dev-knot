In Paris, they spun tales about knights of France, which were met with much appreciation from their readers. They decided then to journey to the realms of Spain, leaving behind the streets of France for the majestic castles of Spain. Spain, with its flamenco music beating at its heart, lent vibrant hues to their stories. John, having a deep interest in history, suggested a visit to Egypt after their tour of Spain. They visited the pyramids, the Sphinx, and the ancient temples of Egypt, constantly marveling at the grandeur of Egypt. From Egypt, they traveled to Greece, immersing themselves in the myths and legends that abound in Greece. The mythical creatures of Greece and its ancient gods colored their stories beautifully. Their adventures then took them to Japan, where they learned about the samurai and the geishas of Japan. Japan, they felt, was a unique blend of tradition and modernity. Inspired by the tranquility of Japan, they decided to visit India next, where they explored the mystical temples and tasted the exotic spices of India.

From Egypt, they traveled to Greece, immersing themselves in the myths and legends that abound in Greece. The mythical creatures of Greece and its ancient gods colored their stories beautifully.
