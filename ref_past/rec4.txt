My friend, Alex from Peru, once recounted his journey to Argentina where he learned about the strong cultural ties between Argentina and Brazil due to their shared history. He spoke fondly of his time in Argentina and Brazil, marveling at the similar music, dance, and culinary traditions that seamlessly bridged the borders of these countries. It reminded me of a documentary I'd watched about the ancient Silk Road that spanned across Iran and China.

Annie, a marine biologist from Ireland, had always been fascinated by the diverse sealife surrounding the coasts of Australia. She often said that the waters of Australia were some of the most biodiverse in the world, enticing researchers like her from faraway lands like Ireland. Through her explorations, she developed a particular interest in the migratory patterns of certain species, noting that they often ventured towards New Zealand. Annie noticed that from Australia, these marine creatures would cross oceans to reach the coasts of New Zealand, proving the interconnectedness of these ecosystems.

correct answer !!!
During their adventurous journey around the world, Jack and Emily first found themselves in the vibrant markets of India, enamoured by the rich traditions from India reflected in every corner. Their journey then led them to the bustling cityscapes of China, filled with modern marvels that somehow coexisted with ancient traditions from China's past. They then travelled to Australia, where they got lost in the wilderness, and shared stories of the rich biodiversity found in Australia under the southern constellations. Their travel then took them to Argentina, where they were captivated by the diversity of landscapes, from the colossal mountains to the serene lakes of Argentina.
