(0)=LLM("You are solving for Game of 24. You need to carefully design an arithmetic expression with all the numbers given to you to form 24. You must use each number exactly once. You may use + - × and parenthesis. You need to carefully design an arithmetic expression using EACH NUMBER EXACTLY ONCE. Hint: 24 can be obtained by 1×24, 2×12, 3×8, 4×6 or 1+23, 2+22, 3+21, 4+20, 5+19, 6+18, 7+17, 8+16, 9+15, 10+14, 11+13, 12+12. Hint: 1 multiplied to anything keeps it unchanged. YOU CAN ONLY USE THE NUMBERS GIVEN TO YOU and NOTHING ELSE. Thus, you should think carefully whether the remaining numbers can form the other value needed to reach 24. Each step you can only connect 2 numbers. Given {(input)}, what is the most possible next step?
