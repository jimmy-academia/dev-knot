Below is one way to set up a chain‐of‐steps solution structure for a five‐number Game of 24 problem. In this structure, we “drill down” step‐by‐step by first combining two numbers from the five to leave four, then applying a similar four‐number strategy (as in the provided example) to eventually reduce to two numbers that can be directly combined to yield 24. Each numbered step is a separate LLM “call” that builds on the previous work. For example:

---

**(0)**  
```
LLM("You are solving for Game of 24. You need to carefully design an arithmetic expression with all the numbers given to you to form 24. You must use each number exactly once. You may use +, -, × and parentheses. Hint: 24 can be obtained by 1×24, 2×12, 3×8, 4×6 or by various sums (e.g. 1+23, 2+22, etc.). YOU CAN ONLY USE THE NUMBERS GIVEN TO YOU and nothing else. Each step you can only connect 2 numbers. Given {(input)} (five numbers), what is the most possible next step? Give me 12 most likely options that combine two of the numbers arithmetically using addition, subtraction, or multiplication.")
```

**(1)**  
```
LLM("You are solving for Game of 24 with five numbers. Given {(input)}, what is the most possible next step? Here are 12 options (from (0)) that combine two of the numbers arithmetically. Analyze each option and consider whether the remaining four numbers may be combined arithmetically to eventually obtain 24.")
```

**(2)**  
```
LLM("You are solving for Game of 24 with five numbers. Given {(input)}, conduct the chosen step and obtain the partial solution. Output the current state as [arithmetic expression | four remaining values]. For example, [3 + 4 5 2 1 | 7 5 2 1]. Output only the state and nothing else.")
```

**(3)**  
```
LLM("{(2)} Output the four values on the right-hand side of the square bracket.")
```

> Now we have reduced the problem from five to four numbers.

---

**(4)**  
```
LLM("You are now solving for Game of 24 with the remaining four numbers {(3)}. What is the most possible next step? Give me 12 most likely options that combine two of these four numbers arithmetically (using addition, subtraction, or multiplication).")
```

**(5)**  
```
LLM("You are solving for Game of 24 with these four numbers {(3)}. Here are 12 options from (4). Analyze each option and consider whether the remaining three values may be combined arithmetically to obtain 24. DO NOT USE ANY VALUE BESIDES the four values provided. Give your reasoning.")
```

**(6)**  
```
LLM("You are solving for Game of 24 with four numbers {(3)}. Conduct the chosen step and obtain the partial solution. Output the current state as [arithmetic expression | three remaining values]. Output only the state and nothing else.")
```

**(7)**  
```
LLM("{(6)} Output the three values on the right-hand side of the square bracket.")
```

> At this point, the problem has been reduced to three numbers.

---

**(8)**  
```
LLM("You are solving for Game of 24 with the three remaining numbers {(7)}. What is the most possible next step? Give me 12 most likely options that combine two of the numbers arithmetically using addition, subtraction, or multiplication.")
```

**(9)**  
```
LLM("You are solving for Game of 24 with three numbers {(7)}. Here are 12 options from (8). Analyze each option and consider whether the remaining two values may be combined arithmetically to obtain 24. DO NOT USE ANY VALUE BESIDES the three provided. Provide your reasoning.")
```

**(10)**  
```
LLM("You are solving for Game of 24 with three numbers {(7)}. Conduct the chosen step and obtain the partial solution. Output the current state as [arithmetic expression | two remaining values]. Output only the state and nothing else.")
```

**(11)**  
```
LLM("{(10)} Output the two values on the right-hand side of the square bracket.")
```

> Now only two numbers remain.

---

**(12)**  
```
LLM("You are solving for Game of 24 with the two remaining numbers {(11)}. How can you combine these two numbers to obtain 24? Provide the arithmetic expression that achieves this final step.")
```

---

**Final Assembly:**  
To combine the steps into a complete solution that uses all five numbers exactly once, we ask the LLM to assemble the arithmetic expressions from each stage:

**(13)**  
```
LLM("{(2)} Output the arithmetic expression on the left-hand side of the square bracket from step (2).")
```

**(14)**  
```
LLM("{(6)} Output the arithmetic expression on the left-hand side of the square bracket from step (6).")
```

**(15)**  
```
LLM("{(10)} Output the arithmetic expression on the left-hand side of the square bracket from step (10).")
```

**(16)**  
```
LLM("You are solving for Game of 24 with five numbers {(input)}. We have taken these steps:  
Step 1: {(13)};  
Step 2: {(14)};  
Step 3: {(15)};  
Step 4: {(12)}.  
What is the final correct arithmetic expression that obtains 24?")
```

---

This multi-layer structure ensures that:
- **Step (0)–(3):** A valid first operation is chosen from the five numbers, leaving four numbers.  
- **Step (4)–(7):** The four numbers are processed in a similar fashion as the four-number solution example.  
- **Step (8)–(11):** The three remaining numbers are reduced to two numbers.  
- **Step (12):** The final two numbers are combined to produce 24.  
- **Step (13)–(16):** The partial arithmetic expressions are assembled into one complete expression that uses all five numbers exactly once.

This is one possible solution structure for a five-number Game of 24 problem.
