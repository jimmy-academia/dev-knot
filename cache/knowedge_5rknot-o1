Below is one possible “five‐number” solution structure that parallels the example you provided for four numbers.  The idea is simply extended by one extra step so that we go from five numbers → four numbers → three numbers → two numbers → final answer.  

You will see that each step’s prompt or “LLM” call closely follows the logic of the four‐number version.  Specifically:

1. We start with five numbers.  
2. We ask for 12 possible ways to combine any two of the five numbers (using +, −, ×).  
3. We analyze which of those 12 ways might still lead us to 24.  
4. We pick one of the 12 ways, combine those two numbers, and produce a partial result plus four remaining numbers.  
5. We repeat that pattern (ask for 12 next steps, analyze them, pick one, produce partial result) until only two numbers remain.  
6. Finally, we see how to obtain 24 from the last two numbers, and at the end we piece everything together into a single arithmetic expression.

Below is the structure labeled from \(\text{(0)}\) up to \(\text{(16)}\).  You can of course rename them or adapt them, but the main idea is to have a consistent chain of prompts and references:

---

### **(0)**
```
LLM(
  "You are solving a 'Game of 24' for five numbers. 
   You must use each number exactly once with +, -, ×, and parentheses to form 24. 
   At each step, you may only combine two of the available numbers (or partial expressions) into a single new partial expression. 

   Given {(input)}, what are 12 most likely options that combine two of the numbers (using +, -, or ×)?"
)
```
**Purpose**:  
Given the original five numbers, produce a list of 12 possible pairwise operations (e.g. “2 × 3,” “4 + 5,” etc.).

---

### **(1)**
```
LLM(
  "You are solving a 'Game of 24' for five numbers. 
   You must use each number exactly once. 
   We are focusing on the same 12 options we just enumerated: {(0)}. 
   Analyze each option briefly: 
   - Does combining those two numbers in that way keep open a path to 24 with the remaining numbers? 
   - Why or why not?

   Give me your reasoning for each of the 12 options."
)
```
**Purpose**:  
Analyze the same 12 options from step **(0)**, discussing how likely they are to lead to 24.

---

### **(2)**
```
LLM(
  "Take one of the 12 options you find most promising. 
   Perform that operation and produce a partial solution of the form:
       [arithmetic expression | four remaining values]
   For example: [2 × 3 5 7 8 | 6 7 8 5]
   Only output the new partial expression plus the four leftover numbers in brackets."
)
```
**Purpose**:  
We pick the actual step to execute, combining two of the five numbers.  We now have (1) partial‐expression “slot” plus (4) standalone numbers.

---

### **(3)**
```
LLM(
  "{(2)} Output the four remaining values on the right side of the bracket."
)
```
**Purpose**:  
Just extract the four leftover numbers (or sub‐expressions) from the bracket so we can feed them into the next prompt.

---

### **(4)**
```
LLM(
  "You are solving a 'Game of 24' now for these four numbers: {(3)}. 
   Give me 12 likely ways to combine two of them using +, -, ×.  
   Note: we will continue trying to reach 24 using exactly these 4 values (plus the partial expression from before)."
)
```
**Purpose**:  
This is the “four‐number” scenario now.  As before, we generate 12 possible next operations.

---

### **(5)**
```
LLM(
  "We have the 4 numbers {(3)}. 
   Here are 12 ways to combine two of them: {(4)}. 
   Analyze each of the 12. 
   Which ones might still allow us to reach 24, given the partial expression we already have from step (2)? 
   Give reasoning."
)
```
**Purpose**:  
Analyze the new list of 12 options for the four‐number scenario.

---

### **(6)**
```
LLM(
  "Pick the most promising operation among the 12. 
   Perform it and produce a partial solution of the form:
       [arithmetic expression | three remaining values]
   Only output that bracketed state and nothing else."
)
```
**Purpose**:  
We pick the best among those 12 and reduce our set from 4 numbers to 3 (plus the partial expression chain).

---

### **(7)**
```
LLM(
  "{(6)} Output the three values on the right‐hand side of the bracket."
)
```
**Purpose**:  
Extract the three leftover numbers/sub‐expressions.

---

### **(8)**
```
LLM(
  "We now have 3 numbers or partial expressions: {(7)}. 
   Provide 12 possible ways to combine two of them with +, -, or ×. 
   Our goal remains to reach 24 eventually, using each element exactly once."
)
```
**Purpose**:  
List 12 ways to go from 3 numbers/expressions to 2.

---

### **(9)**
```
LLM(
  "Given the 3 items {(7)}, 
   here are 12 ways to combine two of them: {(8)}. 
   Analyze these 12 carefully. 
   Which ones might still lead to 24, and why?"
)
```
**Purpose**:  
Analyze which pairwise combination is most likely to lead to 24.

---

### **(10)**
```
LLM(
  "Pick the best operation from those 12 to continue.  
   Execute it and produce a partial solution of the form:
       [arithmetic expression | two remaining values]
   Only output that bracketed state and nothing else."
)
```
**Purpose**:  
We pick the step that reduces from 3 numbers/expressions to just 2.

---

### **(11)**
```
LLM(
  "{(10)} Output the two values on the right‐hand side of the bracket."
)
```
**Purpose**:  
Extract the final two values left.

---

### **(12)**
```
LLM(
  "We now have these two items: {(11)}. 
   Show how to combine them (with +, -, or ×) to reach 24.  
   If it’s feasible, give the final arithmetic step.  
   If not feasible, explain."
)
```
**Purpose**:  
Given the final 2 values, see how to turn them into 24.

---

### **(13)**
```
LLM(
  "{(2)} Output the arithmetic expression on the left side of the bracket."
)
```
**Purpose**:  
Recall the partial expression from step **(2)** (our very first operation).  This is needed to help build the final combined expression.

---

### **(14)**
```
LLM(
  "{(6)} Output the arithmetic expression on the left side of the bracket."
)
```
**Purpose**:  
Recall the partial expression from step **(6)** (the second major operation).

---

### **(15)**
```
LLM(
  "{(10)} Output the arithmetic expression on the left side of the bracket."
)
```
**Purpose**:  
Recall the partial expression from step **(10)** (the third major operation).

---

### **(16)**
```
LLM(
  "We have taken these steps: 
   Step 1: {(13)} 
   Step 2: {(14)} 
   Step 3: {(15)} 
   Step 4: {(12)}  (the final operation)

   Combine them appropriately into a single parenthesized expression 
   (or indicate the correct final expression) that shows how to get 24 
   from the original five numbers exactly once each."
)
```
**Purpose**:  
Now that you have all partial expressions plus the final step from (12), combine them into one complete arithmetic expression that yields 24.

## How It All Fits Together

1. **(0)/(1)**: Propose 12 ways to pair up two of the five original numbers, then analyze.  
2. **(2)**: Actually execute one pairing, produce `[ expression | 4 left ]`.  
3. **(3)**: Extract the 4 leftover numbers.  
4. **(4)/(5)**: Propose and analyze 12 ways to reduce those 4 numbers.  
5. **(6)**: Execute the best, produce `[ expression | 3 left ]`.  
6. **(7)**: Extract the 3 leftover numbers.  
7. **(8)/(9)**: Propose and analyze ways to reduce those 3 to 2.  
8. **(10)**: Execute the best, produce `[ expression | 2 left ]`.  
9. **(11)**: Extract the 2 leftover numbers.  
10. **(12)**: Combine those last 2 to reach 24.  
11. **(13), (14), (15)**: Retrieve partial expressions from each prior step.  
12. **(16)**: Combine everything to form the single complete expression yielding 24.

You can, of course, tailor the text/prompts as needed (e.g., highlight or downplay certain hints, alter the exact instructions or textual style).  The critical pattern is the same as in your four‐number structure—just extended with one extra step so that you combine five numbers, one pair at a time, until you reach 24.
