0,"[""This is some of the rudest, most unprofessional  service I have ever seen. The waitress was in a foul mood as soon as we entered the restaurant. She seemed upset when we didn't order more than pizzas. When she returned with plates for the pizza, she gruffly dropped them on the table. She never offered to refill our drinks, she seemed more concerned with playing with her cell phone. She dumped the bill on our table without saying a word. Do not support a business that mistreat customers this way."", ""I have read some of the other reviews and should have read them before trying this place.  Eating should be enjoyable.  I have started eating at Jade Garden at Hillsborough and Habana.  Definitely worth the drive to get some quality Chinese food."", ""As a senior, I was looking for a bank for investments.  I wanted to diversify, and not have all my money with Edward Jones which is a great investment company.  When I entered the bank I was ignored.  The employees were chatting.  I had $500,000+ to invest.  I do not know why I was treated this way, but I chose to leave and go else where."", ""Not Authentic Indian.. its more like the american chinese restaurants!!! Biggest Pet Peeve was the Biryani.. the rice was undercooked and chicken tasted like it was borrowed from another curry...   Also the server was extremely intrusive."", ""The margarita tasted like lemonade. It was AWFUL and tasted like it had no tequila in it at all. I asked to either switch it out for something else or for them to remake it and they wouldn't do either. I won't ever be back! Terrible service."", ""The opening of The Nurturing Nest is an invaluable new resource to Reno families and moms-to-be!

Nurturing Nest founders Tiffany and Rachel are kind, passionate and dedicated to helping support pre/post natal needs of families in Reno and definitely visit their website for all of the resources they provide!"", ""My boyfriend and I arrived at Don Pablo's at 5:45 on Saturday night. We were told the wait was 30 minutes- awesome. After 45 minutes passed, we checked in with the hostess again. \""\"" Oh, you had a faulty buzzer\""\"". No apology, no coming to find us, nothing. The manager took us to our table, again no apology- just explained that this happens a lot.  After being seated, our server came 15 minutes later for our drink order. No introduction, just \""\""What do you want to drink.\""\"" After ordering a margarita and beer, we waited another 10 minutes for our drinks to arrive.  I regret our appetizer of flauetas or whatever they are called. Frozen taquitos that were rock hard when they arrived at my table. After the appetizer, it took 35 minutes for our entrees to reach the table. My boyfriends was cold and mine was incorrect. After already being in this restaurant for over 2 hours, we had enough. The waiter saw we were frustrated and took one meal off the bill. Terrible service, terrible food, terrible management. First and last visit for us!"", ""Some of the more creative house dishes looked good and inspired like the chicken and waffles and the burger but for Vietnamese food it was just ok.  We had the avocado fresh rolls and they tasted just ok and the peanut sauce was not great.  The real upsetting part of this meal was we had a vegan in our party and they asked the waitress what on the menu was vegan and she pointed out all the tofu dishes.  Ok good start!  Both the meat eaters and on meat eaters in our party have options.  The follow up question she asked was  that there were absolutely no animal products in any of the tofu dishes?  The answer she got was no animal products.  After ordering the tofu vermicelli she found out it had fish sauce on it and told the waitress.  The waitress sort of stared at her blankly and didn't really know what to do.  Eventually we just asked to see the menu again and asked if the  sate veggies was vegan?  The waitress explained it was veggies with a lemongrass and spicy sauce.  The waitress said yes it was vegan.  She sked if they could make It less spicy, and was told yes. And so asked if she could have that instead.  When it came out it was steamed veggies with rice.  No sauce, nothing.  Some of the veggies had brown spots on them.  This was sent back and we went to lost love after for pho.  With vegan diets being so popular it would make sense if the staff knew their menu better and the chefs were able to actually cook something inspired for their guests with simple restrictions.  We went to bhava the night before with someone with a nut allergy and the chef made  an inspired dessert for them on the spot because there was no dessert they could eat on the actual menu.  With so many restaurants in New Orleans I wouldn't go back or recommend it."", ""The service SUCKS!!!!  The food is mediocre, at best,  and definitely not worth a second trip. We ordered flat bread to start 30 min before we ordered apps and entrees. The flatbreads arrived at the same time the apps did."", ""Mediocre at best. We just spent $100 on a bottle of wine and five appetizers and it was totally underwhelming. The duck appetizer was tough with flabby skin. The scallop appetizer was cooked well. Roasted vegetables were overpriced at $10. Shrimp crostini was flavorless and didn't seem fresh. Meatballs were nothing to write home to mom about. Service was fine but we won't be back."", ""Amazing food! Shrimp and grits and corned beef hash were delicious. Reasonable price for very good food!   Don't be intimidated by the host, she's really nice lol."", ""Apartment is falling apart there is no insulation they don't repair anything. You can never get in touch with anyone the amenities are non existent there is no gate the pool is closed. The forced trash service sucks. Insects get in all the broken windows. They do anything to get you to move in and NOTHING to fix anything. You can hear your neighbors pee and everything else! Everyone has the same complaints it's crazy. We are trying to buy a house as soon as we find one we are out of here it's ridiculous. See pictures! Don't move here it's not worth it."", ""The closing and opening timings are off in Yelp... closing time is not 10 pm. The chef goes home at 9 pm.   We were travelling from North and almost reached there little before 9 pm. Wanted to order ahead of time.We called to confirm they are open, and also order some food so that they are there soon after we reach. They said that the chef went home. I explained that we saw their business timings in yelp and are travelling from far. They asked how many we were. When we said we were 3, they started the old story. Chef gone home... Then why do you ask how many in your party?    They are not very polite or accomodating I must say...  Hann Dynasty is  better than this place behaviour wise, and they speak English better."", ""Once again I tried this place because my wife liked it. Semi good food but very poor service. Where do they get some of these waitresses? Our waitress with a long braided blonde ponytail could only walk by us flirting with another waiter. She never even asked us anything until we were ready to leave. Very disappointed once again!!!"", ""the foods great, but no buflight on tap.i love the servers there , especially Jamie White, whose the best server. But again. Lack of Bud light is a big negative"", ""I've come here several times, with locals and with my friends that are coming to New Orleans to visit. Although the food is okay, the service is waaaay below the standards of expect. The first time I came here I was blown away, every time after that I felt like was chasing the dragon. Don't get me wrong, the manager attempted to rectify our \""\""not so great experiences\""\""... But that doesn't mean she can ensure every experience is satisfactory. The employees have given me sass and have not been so respectful of my time tables. Uhh so sad because I enjoyed this place but I think my days of being a Lucys fan is OVER."", ""Slum Lords of the worth kind.  Don't expect your security deposit back. If you so much as put a hole in the wall to hang a picture they will charge you for damaging the property. They will lie and say you broke things, and the place was trashed in order to keep your security deposit. They will basically try to get as much money out of you as they can. If you try to pay online that will cost a fee, but they won't tell you, just so they can get more money.  They also do not upkeep their properties well. Our roof leaked and the air conditioning didn't work. They would not replace it or pay someone properly to fix the roof. They are slum lords of the worth. They will take your money and claim you ruined their place without proper evidence. Do not trust them. I don't care how bad you need a place, they will mistreat you and steal your security deposit. You have been warned!"", ""The drinks and service are pretty good here, but the security they have is aggressive and poorly trained.  I was spending the evening at the bar having a great time with my girlfriend and the other patrons. I was there for several hours and decided it was time to leave. As I walked out three security guards approached me and starting harassing me. They told me to leave (which I was on my free will already)... I questioned why they were harassing me and they threw me on the ground, improperly handcuffed me (which is illegal),screamed at me, called me a \""\""fat mother f'er\""\"" \""\""Bitch\""\"" \""\""that's what you get\""\"" among other obscenities, and proceeded to call the pinellas county sheriffs department. All this happened on a public sidewalk 20 yards away from the business. They left bruises and marks all over my body, injured my knee to the point I'm limping, ripped my shirt, and broke my glasses. They made up a story that I tried to hit a bartender (mind you I tipped 25% and was having a good night. Plus I'm not even a violent person). The police showed up shortly after all this... I was illegally detained and released after they concluded I did nothing wrong...I was trespassed verbally from the property due to this and asked to leave. If I truly assaulted someone like the security claimed I did I would have been arrested. They're aggressive and had no right to assault me.   I called after this all happened and asked to speak to the owner to try and comprehend what happened. Brooke answered the phone. I asked her why I was assaulted and I asked for the video of what happened. She responded with \""\""you've been trespassed and get a subpoena if you want the video\""\"". She hung up on me afterwards. I called back and at that point she told me she'll get me arrested for harassment if I call again... They know they're wrong. Just be careful going here... No one expects to be assaulted at a business you just gave money to."", ""One of the worst places in Tucson!  Cold food , rude service. They have the right idea but fail to deliver"", ""Don't do business with this \""\""company\""\"".  They don't respond to emails or phone calls. In fact, they don't even have a voicemail set up so it just rings to no avail. I ordered a product along with 2 day shipping.  I waited the 2-3 days processing time and emailed to inquire for tracking number. Nothing. Called over and over. For an establishment that sets such strict guidelines on no refunds, high restocking fees and also threatens they will seek monetary damages if you file a pay pal claim, you would think they would follow their own rules.  As soon as I filed a claim with PayPal they responded and refunded my money. How difficult is it to communicate with your customer?  It's a fraudulent business in my opinion and PayPal should discontinue doing business with them.""]",2

Super sweet and very helpful.  Ps. My sandwich was DELICIOUS"", ""When I was with Charter 10 years ago their service was intermittent and customer service was horrendous. I've been a happy customer of AT&T DSL for the last eight years, but was repeatedly approached by Charter stating that they are now the best in the country, their whole network was revamped and that they now have zero issues. I signed up with Charter as of August 1 and the last 4 days were horrendous. The initial tech who was setting up the service was entirely incompetent and was asking ME questions about the router and the modem. The connection was lightning fast for about 2 days. As of yesterday the signal became weak, pages are taking 30-45 seconds to load and sometimes there is no connection at all. I called Charter and spent 15 minutes on hold, then talked to someone who hung up on me and was finally able to schedule a technician to bring a \""\""signal booster\""\"" to my place. I live in Central St. Louis, not in a rural area, so apparently their \""\""best in the nation\""\"" network still leaves much to be desired."", ""Changing this to a 1 after I just had to pay $10 to park. Seriously?   Not like they aren't making any money on anything else in there....."", ""My sister discovered this restaurant and our family is so happy to have some authentic Salvadoran food. Food is great but the service is sometimes slow, so don't be in a rush when you go. Pupusas and the Bistec Salvadoreano -- yum!"", ""Went today to look at tackle boxes.  I know it's Christmas, so I expected the crowds.  The problem was the line for Santa went along the wall with the tackle boxes.  There wasn't enough space to see anything except the top shelves, but you could only see them from afar.  The aisle was so narrow to begin with and with everyone in line having a cart it was impossible to look at what I wanted.  Even if I asked someone to move, so I could get closer, it would have been useless since there was no where for them to move there carts.  I just decided to leave and forget making my purchase I had planned on.  As I walked out I told an employee my concern and it seemed like I was bothering her.  She was standing at the exit tell customers, bye."", ""Food: The best selection of bruschetta.  My favorite is the goat cheese and pesto unfortunately for some reason they took that off the menu - which I'd like to go on record as saying I am upset about that.  My second favorite (which is still on the menu) is the Pistachio herbed Ricotta with Lavender Honey.  Tria's food is on the lighter side.  Usually when I go with someone else we load up on brushetta and cheese and split a panino.  One of my favorites is the Smoked Chicken panino.  During happy hour they have good beer specials.  If you don't feel like drinking while you there I recommend the passionberry iced tea.  It's bottomless - can't beat that.  Service: I've been here countless times and never had a problem with the service.  Everyone is nice and the food comes out quickly.  Ambiance: It depends which one you go to.  The one around 13th is bigger and has nice heated outside seating.  The one at 17th and sansom is smaller and since you can't make a reservation you have to get there before 5 to get a table.  The inside are both are basically the same.  Hardwood floors and a nice bar.  Candle at the table.  It can get a bit loud but other than that it's a nice place to eat."", ""Run to this place and get your free shot check in offer!!  Even though it was jam packed with few seats open, it was still easy to find street parking.  There are many tables outside for enjoying the weather and plenty inside for those inclement days.  We tried a hot cinnamon roll and it was gooey and delicious.  The frosting was a bit lemony which really brightened the flavor up.  I was in love with my triple shot latte.  Everything about Coffeebar was charming and delicious."", ""Tried and true Southern BBQ!  The drive thru was fast and the worker friendly, efficient and professional!  We ordered one pound and slaw.  The convenience of the drive thru is amazing and smokin' hot! Feedback:  The register needs to be facing other way the worker cannot see the screen due to sun glare.  Boo!"", ""Was not impressed with the store. The employee could care less I walked in and needed some questions answered and it was like I was bothering him that I was there. There are other stores so I will try to utilize the Brandon or valrico one although this one is so close to where I live. It's a shame."", ""Horrible customer service! The employees here seem to hate life cause they don't smile and have a very nonchalant attitude to every customer in the line. One of the employees smelt like weed and looked like he just got done smoking a Bong! Another employee was very rude when she asked a customer not stick her hands over the glass when the customer was only trying to point out what she wanted. The employee didn't need to respond to the customer in such a rude manner. I just moved here to Brentwood and I'm very disappointed in this establishment and the employees here.   These employees either need to be retrained and taught how to smile and or just need to be replaced with humans who actually love life and don't take their job for granted!"", ""love the new machines  nice and air conditioned  clean  the owner is super funny  definitely my new place"", ""I used to really really like going to this Hardees. I liked Hardees breakfast menu a lot.  I even came here and spent close to $30 on breakfast items for St. Patrick's day.  All of that came crashing down one Saturday afternoon when the window checker never gave my debit card back to me (as I was distracted in my vehicle) and bought $140 worth of gas.  Thankfully my bank was able to stop any further transactions before they started buying flat screens at Best Buy. I won't risk using the drive thru here again."", ""I'm am by no means an expert when it comes to getting ink. But I can say with confidence that this was by far the BEST experience I've had getting a tattoo. The parlor was immaculate and the people working there were knowledgable and professional. They mainly work by appointment only, but were more than happy to squeeze me in at the end of the day when all that day's appointments were finished. My artist, Amanda Grace Leadman, was extremely talented, diligent, and friendly. She wanted to be sure I was getting exactly what I wanted and was very meticulous when tattooing it so that it came out absolutely perfect. After finishing early, she noticed another tat of mine was looking quite spotty and faded (this isn't a small tattoo, it takes up most of my right forearm) and she offered to touch it up for me for free. She redid the entire thing for me in the same sitting. I was simply blown away. After getting tattoos at four different parlors trying to find the perfect one, I can confidently say that I won't ever go anywhere else for ink.

We ended up purchasing our stroller, gilder, crib and dresser here. Monica and Andrea were our guardian angels through the entire process. There is so much you have to buy and you don't want to waste your money- they ensured we spent our money on quality products and allowed us to make our own decisions after educating us on all of the offerings in the store.

Don't waste your money here."", ""Looking for something tasteless, greasy, and overpriced?! Head on over to George's Sandwich Shop! What a disaster. The roast pork sandwich is listed as $7.00, fine, but any sandwich-eater worth their salt (or pepper) knows that a sandwich isn't complete without some toppings, and George's sticks it to you ever-so-casually: \""\""Anything on that?\""\"" Unsuspecting customers will be charged on top of the $7 for what should be basic, included toppings. This would be acceptable if the sandwich had any semblance of decency, yet it is completely revolting from first glance to last choked bite.The bread was completely soggy and drenched in oil that was hot enough to burn my hand. The pork was entirely flavorless, the provolone and broccoli rabe couldn't even save it. I regret wasting my appetite on this disgrace of a sandwich. Do yourself a favor and go down the street to Paesano's instead."", ""I made reservations and they had trouble seating us when we arrived. With a hungry 1 year old toddler this did not go over well. The staff did try to accommodate us while we waited. They offered a cup of ice...which was weird or crayons for our little one. Finally, we were seated and the waitress was great.

The chef (Yun) was from Puerto Rico but had spent time in NC and we talked some about that. The sushi started out terrific and just got more creative and tasty from there. The flavor combinations were not only creative, but sensibly ordered so that they complemented eachother, culminating in what felt like a gourmet meal from appetizer to dessert.

I can honestly say that based On this experience, I would never go back.   First review: Great food and friendly service. We had an Italian hoagie, and cheesesteak hoagie, and hot wings.

Drinks are good but come out slow and it took over an hour to bring out our appetizer The service is really slow. Our server seemed very overwhelmed but the restaurant wasn't even packed. On a Saturday afternoon with nice weather there should probably be more servers working. Tables are left messy and we actually had to wipe the food off of our table ourselves.  I ordered the steak and eggs and when I asked our server if the eggs could be prepared over easy instead of scrambled, she said she didn't know because they pre scramble the eggs in the morning...  When our food came out it was atrocious. I am appalled that the kitchen would even send it out in the state that it was. 1 burger had an eggshell on it and the other had cold congealed cheese and the bun was twice the size of he burger. The steak and eggs were the size of a side. And the eggs were scrambled...  Advice to management- hire bussers and greet people as they walk in... It's not always obvious when you should seat yourself. Also isn't fair for servers to have to have to apologize for management and kitchen staff not doing their jobs right.  After all was said and done, management gave us $10 gift cards which didn't even cover the cost of our drinks and even our server said 'this is bullshit'."", ""This place surpassed our expectations!

They had grounds keepers there the morning of to clean the restrooms and clean the grounds, also had parking attendants there to guide our guests to our venue.   If you do book Singleton versus their much larger venue Godric Grove the only major downside is the parking situation - you're guests have to walk quite a ways to get to your venue. And, besides electrical outlets and a sink - its pretty bare. No lighting anywhere so you need to be prepared to have all of the basic things covered.

As I waited for 14 minutes to get my meal several other customers approached the counter  complaining about their order accuracy. I watched as several people had to repeat this process three or more times before getting their order right or they gave up in frustration. No staff member including the English speaking manager/supervisor ever apologized or acknowledged the customers exasperation it gave the assistance if caring at all.   I figured with my long wait that I would at least get a hot fresh meal but apparently my food must have been praised long before my arrival. I received a cold Big Mac that was half unassembled in the box with my side of cold soft fries. Not sure why it took 20 minutes from the time I arrived at the counter until I received my order since the time was obviously not doesn't preparing my food and there were not many other customers in the store.

The huevos rancheros deluxe. The actual huevos rancheros base is flavorless. My over easy eggs were, in my most generous interpretation, over medium. The conservative helping of goat cheese (allegedly a main ingredient in the deluxe) was extremely low quality, smelling and tasting of goat the way very low quality goat cheese is wont to do.

5,"[""I have eaten here several times during the four years I have lived in Philly, and have had happy hours or cocktail events here as well, as an employee of a company in the building; and I have had wonderful experiences. This is thanks completely to the *servers, bartenders, and kitchen staff*. On Valentine's Day, however, we had a very different experience. I am confident that the servers and kitchen staff were amazing as always, but we never found out. We made our reservation about a month and a half early, to ensure a window seat. OpenTable asked for a credit card when booking--no problem; we provided it. Upon arrival, we were told that, since we did not place a deposit, there was not a table for us. Yes, they could see our reservation in the system, they said; they can see the date on which we placed the reservation, a month and a half prior. However, they claim to have called us (one time) to get a deposit from us, and since they were unsuccessful, they didn't hold us a table (again, they can see our reservation, they knew we were coming).  **No one had ever called to obtain a deposit from us.**  Further, had they needed a deposit, that should have been worked out between OpenTable and R2L--not our problem. OpenTable asked for a credit card and we provided one. Plus, how incredibly rude is it to require a deposit for a table reservation anyway? As a semi-regular at this place I find that greatly offensive. We weren't speaking with hourly-waged youngsters either; we started with a manager and were escalated to \""\""one of the owners\""\"". Neither woman made an attempt to be friendly, let alone apologetic or accommodating in any way.  This lady who was \""\""one of the owners\""\"" should definitely keep herself exclusively in the back of the house, away from any sort of paying customer.  I have never, as a customer, been treated so poorly or talked to so terribly. And, no, I can assure you, we were not out of line or yelling or making a scene or rude for our part; we just aren't the type. She was plain awful.  Never so much as a shred of an inkling of a hint of an apology or any effort whatsoever.  So, despite all of the rave verbal reviews I have given everyone I know about this place in the past, I will now make sure that everyone we know, meet, work with, or do business with--several of whom work in that building--does not ever drink or dine at R2L.  And, clearly, we will never step foot into the place again either. After leaving, we had an amazing meal with mind-blowing service at DEVON SEAFOOD. Go there instead!"", ""From the looks of it, Helzberg really don't care much about the social media comments and their customer's satisfaction. Today my wife and I just came out of Macy's cancel one of the ring I bought her for Valentine's Day due to wrong size. I already knew their services have gone to the gutter in recent years, its worse than going to a car dealership, where you get judged by their superficial eyes. If they don't think you are going to buy, they don't want to waste a second on you. So I told the first lady who greet us straight up, I was looking for a diamond ring around $800, I showed her the picture of the ring we cancelled at Macy's, all I asked is something comparable in price for a gold diamond ring. She showed me one right away but the diamond was a lot smaller than what we were looking for.  But she was able to find another one, not perfect, but at least my wife liked. I asked her what is the best price she can give us, after some negotiation, she said there is a $150 discount, and because we were still unsure (the diamond was still a lot smaller than the one in Macy's for similar price), she said she would throw in resizing service for free. It was already around noon time, both of us were hungry and I didn't want to rush a decision like this, so I told her we will think over lunch and be back if we decides.   So later that evening, I got the chance to go out alone, so I went back to the store to make the purchase. Right away I made the mistake telling the ladies that are working there I was there earlier, talked to a tall older lady, and I'm ready to make the purchase. At the time there were three of them, one was busy with the customer, one was on the phone, then there is a lady completely free. But you can tell right away she does not want to help me since I was already here before, even she get some commission it will not be the whole commission. So she told me go talk to the lady on the phone... Then the lady on the phone doesn't seem to have any interest helping me either, kind of yelling across from the store to the other \""\""free\""\"" lady something I didn't even pay attention. So I'm standing in the middle of them feeling unwanted by those two. Finally the first free lady ask me whats my name blah blah... after wasted few more minutes she finally asked me which ring. So I pointed to the ring and told her what price was promised me earlier. Again she asked my name (for what reason I don't know), then she asked me if I had the other lady's card (I wasn't very happy with the first lady's service to begin with, she often answered my question in a snobbish way as if we couldn't afford the more expensive ring like \""\""oh that's $3000....\""\"" in a condescending tone. So even when I told her we will think over lunch she didn't bother to give me her card.    By now, the evening lady was trying to hint to the other lady I had no reference maybe she should just sell to me like a regular sale. The other lady obviously doesn't want her to get the complete commission (also it is breaking the industry rule). While all of them keep having the tone I was just making up the price which I was promised from the morning lady! So I said maybe you should call her up, most sales people who care about their commission wouldn't mind the phone call.  At first the evening lady doesn't seem want to (too much work to make a call you know), finally the other lady also suggest she should call. So she went to the back room for roughly 5 to 10 minutes (don't know why she couldn't just call right front of me, the phone is right there!)  She comes back and told me there are not even a $150 discount (even though there is advertisement for $50 off on $299 purchase, and we always get their catelog in the mail, usually is $50 for every x amount of purchase, the ring originally is $900, which made sense when the morning lady quoted $150 discount). On top of that, there is a free $300 speaker promotion going on for anything over $600, and the morning lady said I can chose $150 discount or the $300 speaker.   Anyway, my point of writing this review isn't even about not getting the originally quoted price, I sincerely hope who ever runs Helzberg Diamonds's marketing, online marketing, social media marketing or even if just the store manager who actually care about his or her store image, can take a look at their staff. The culture they are building has changed so much since we bought our wedding band over 10 years ago. I read few other people's review, they shared the similar feeling. Their staff are just bunch of vulchers.  I worked a commission job throughout my college years, I don't know what happened in recent years. these people on commission doesn't understand how to treat their customers, and just expect the customers pay their paycheck.

I got a gift certificate to go there last December.  It expires this November, so I was trying to use it before it was no longer valid.  With this said, I tried to make an appointment to go since this past Winter.  I was NEVER able to get in.  Seriously, what kind of nail salon doesn't have availability on a random afternoon?  Anyways...  I finally called last week, knowing it would take a while to get an appointment, and I went this afternoon.  My certificate was for a \""\""signature pedicure, signature facial, and 60 minute massage\""\"".  I really only wanted a manicure and a pedicure, as I didn't want a random facial from this place, so I asked them to please give me a manicure instead of a facial.  It's a win for them, so they went with it.  I was planning to get the massage, but when I got there, I wasn't feeling it (the bad reviews here helped sway my decision) and instead, I was told that \""\""the pedicure massage will be longer\""\"".  Fine.  Whatever.    I must mention that the \""\""spa\""\"" is in the back of a store.  There is one manicure station and three pedicure chairs.  In the back of a store...  I repeat.    Upon sitting down for the pedicure, I was told that they would be giving me the manicure at the same time.  I typically get this when a place is super busy and they are trying to save me time...  but I was one of two people in the entire place.  There was no need to double-up on services.  The manicure was terrible.  They used a super coarse file on my nails that had already been soaking in water (bad idea!), and they cut my cuticles without any oil or other softening agent.  When I asked the girl to clean up the polish around the cuticles, I was told that she would \""\""when she was done\""\"".  Well, it's about 8 hours later, and my nails look like crap...  so I guess she lied.    The girl who did my pedicure was very nice.  But her skills as a pedicure-giver were lacking.  However, in her defense, she may have been distracted by the 5 phone calls she GOT UP TO ANSWER during the course of my pedicure.  Or, possibly the other customer who wanted to pay...  she got up to help them, too.  Once my pedicure was done, I asked if I could dry my toe nails, and one of the women there told me that I didn't need to dry my toes because I was wearing sandals.  Umm...  what?    I will never go back to Everlasting Spa.  I would suggest that you don't go at all...  or if you have a random Groupon or Living Social deal, get your money back from them.

My daughter [a UCSB student] needed a short-term public storage unit because her new apartment wasn't available to move-in, before the lease of her old place expired.  So, I researched online for some local businesses.  Only Public Storage is up front about what they charge for their storage units and their website is user-friendly.  Others claim they have competitive prices, but what does that really mean?  Why don't they all clearly list their price for a particular size unit and tell you if it is available or not, without subjecting you to a sales pitch.  I inquired via their website, but they didn't have the courtesy to reply.  Public Storage was also the closest place to her Apt., UCSB, and offered the best deal too.  With their \""\""$1 for the 1st month promo\""\"" it was a no-brainer decision.  Public Storage has got their act together and are very professional.  Does the competition allow you to reserve a unit without making a deposit?  Before I was finished registering online for their \""\""Express Check-In\""\"" during the reservation process, their manager Kristine called to welcome me and answer any question that I might have.  That's impressive.  They also sent a written confirmation restating the size of the unit, your preference [of indoor vs. drive-up access], the cost, and your move-in date.   When we were ready to move into the unit, Manny was our on-site team member, and he made the process hassle-free.  It was ready, and I had a choice of several that were available.  F.Y.I., if you want to keep a mattress clean, then buy one of their giant plastic storage bags.  Their office is well stocked with essential supplies and padlocks too, if you didn't have one already.  Moving out was just as easy, if not easier.  We came when it was convenient for us and left the unit clean and unlocked overnight.  I notified Public Storage online of our move-out.  They inspected the unit, closed out our account, and sent me a receipt.  [I didn't even need to re-visit the place, but did since I was in the area a few days later.  I just wanted to tell Kristine and Henry, who greeted me, what a pleasure it was doing business with them.  I would highly recommend Public Storage and would without hesitation, re-use them again, if the need arises."", ""The food is barely edible. Got goat biryani and goat curry.

But maybe the burger would be the star of the plate? After a few crunches (yes, crunches) that was clearly not the case. The edges of my burger were literally crunchy and very salty (I guess it took a few extra minutes to go from slightly charred to crunchy, hence the long ticket time). By the time I finished my meal, my fries were cold, and miserably so (and I'm not a slow eater).

There again, it was their error in not educating their staff in the rules for scheduling grooming and this error was repeated multiple times when they continued to reschedule late in the day.

Essentially asked us to leave and gave no reason. When we asked for the bill after 1 drink she knew she was in the shit so much she crossed her name out on the receipt to avoid detection (3 times despite us asking specifically for her name and a full unaltered receipt for my records) she  kept  giving us torn off versions  without her name or the name of the place)   We visited after a cards game.

It was 40 degrees in the bathroom, really really cold. 2. The wall next to our table really needed painting, or at least washing, food splatters and grease stains on the paint were really unappealing. The cute puffy wall coverings looked like someone used them as napkins over and over.  A tremendous disappointment after many really great experiences at Southern Cross.  It seems to me they can do a lot better, or close the place for a rehab.  We felt pretty ripped off with brunch, though the live music was awesome.

I was a bit concerned when I met the small-framed woman who was to administer my massage but she did not disappoint; she was strong and knew how to get out out all the knots in my neck, shoulders and back. All the small details made the difference here (i.e. lavender oils), suite decor, etc.  Guests of the hotel receive 20% off hotel services and I highly recommend you budget time before and especially after to hang out in the relaxation lounge on the second floor to have some tea/water/lemonade and soak in the amazing views of the garden and the ocean in the distance."", ""I haven't eaten here in a while because a friend of mines quit, due to rude employers.

I've been known to eat there multiple times a day. Yes, it's that good. I'm not sure if it was when I was a little kid, when my parents were progressive enough to give us a dab of hot sauce when we said a bad word when the craving for spicy dishes began. It could have been eating ridiculous amounts of wings weekly in high school, or dating someone whose father grows sick nasty chiles where this inner beast of spicy came from. Yats completes me.   My all time favorite dishes at Yats are the Spinach-Mushroom \u00c9touff\u00e9e and the Chicken Creole. I try to try everything, because with a rotating menu, there are special dishes that are prepared only once in a blue moon, such as the Thai Curry Chicken \u00c9touff\u00e9e or Chili Cheese \u00c9touff\u00e9e with Chicken instead of the staple crawfish.   Every meal at Yats comes complete with two slice of French bread with a super special butter. There are many choices in hot sauces, so pick your poison wisely. I like the Louisiana Lightning Strike and Cajun Power sauce (in the squirt bottle) to drench my Yats in the almighty power of spice.  I recommend using a heaping sprinkle on your French bread, and then putting a spoonful of your entree on top. HEAVEN!  A word to the wise, the College Ave location is cash only. The staff is very helpful to get around this problem. They'll give you an IOU, but they never forget. Make sure to remember this is cash only so you don't look dumb when you come back.   Joe, the owner, is always at the College Ave location.

There's plenty of options with better beer, better vibes, better clientele, and way better suited for families trying to have fun with their kids.  We regularly visit the breweries of New Orleans and decided to try this place out for the sake of trying them all.

When the food finally came, the Roast Pork sandwich and fries were completely cold (guess that was the half that was done on time).  The pork was fine, but the roll just average and the gravy was awful.  Fries, meh.  Cheese Steak filling looked like ground beef and was a miniscule portion in a large grinder roll.

Total times:  45 minute wait, 15 minutes from order to service, 17 minutes until we were clear of the table!  Not a place for good eats, or good service."", ""Steve Oakley's place is our go to restaurant and has been for years. I can't say enough about the food and the wait staff is unfailingly cordial and efficient. Order the chef's table for an especially happy evening."", ""We ate in. Awful pizza.  Shared the Philly steak pizza with bacon on the side.  Pizza was oily and soggy with little sauce and no flavor. Got sauce on the side and it was so watery as to be a liability.  Bacon was just heated bacon bits (worst I ever had) with no taste but lots more grease.  We were the ONLY customers eating in the entire time. Only sound was the overloud music.  Waiter was just one of the kitchen workers who was, however, very accommodating when he was available.  If you decide to go, I wish you much better luck.  Rating on pizza = minus 2.5"", ""We use to love to go to this location. I don't know what's happened but our last two visits have been horrible service and food left a lot to be desired!

We will try another dot's location."", ""We waited 25 minutes to order a glass of water & 10 minutes later I had to go to the bar to ask if our waitress could come over so we could order food. She was very unfriendly and felt like we were an inconvenience. The temperature was very cold and uncomfortable. Our food was barely warm and slipped on the plate. Certainly will not be back!!"", ""My boyfriend and I went for dinner on a Friday night. We sat at the chef's bar which allows you to see the food being prepared in the open kitchen. It was fun to watch until we noticed that one of the cooks was tasting the food with a spoon then continuing to use the spoon to cook the food. He did this with every dish he cooked, reusing the same dirty spoons to taste, stir, and serve everyone's food. We reluctantly ate our food anyway. It was tasty, but we both got sick the next day. Will never go there again. I would have said something to the head chef, but he was present in and around the kitchen the entire time, so I had to assume he saw this too and did not care."", ""This place is super unprofessional. The manager who says his name is \""\""Johnson\""\"" is extremely unprofessional. He doesn't understand that when working in a place of business where people are accompanied by their children you cannot curse out loud. He also doesn't understand that of a customer comes in close to closing time you don't tell them to hurry up. I don't care how good the food is. I wouldn't know because I lost my appetite and left. This guy is trash. And the management should realize that he's a reflection of them and their business. Definitely stay away. If you're starving, eat air.

In Germantown no less?!?!?!? The old guy behind the counter (I'm assuming he's the proprietor) was unwelcoming, surly, and kinda rude. I only ordered a cheesesteak with fried onions...admittedly without looking at the menu..and when he told me it was $8.90, I thought I jumped into a wormhole and was in South Philly at Pat's or Geno's. Let me just jump to my summation...it wasn't worth $8.90. Did they pass a new cheesesteak tax too??? It's all good and lesson learned. I will be going back to the papi stores and getting a much better cheesesteak for half the price. And they should be ashamed for fleecing people for using credit/debit cards. Hell..they even charge more for SPENDING more. Who does that????"", ""The food at this Qdoba was standard, but the service was horrible!  There were three people behind the counter and none of them wanted to help customers.  There was no one in line, and two of the three just kept standing at the sink talking to each other even after the third employee tried to call over the person working the first station.  We waited and waited, and a line of 3 other couples built up before the gentleman at the first station finally sighed loudly and walked to his station."", ""We shop at acme pretty frequently. Today, we accidentally left a bag with a good amount of food in it at the self check out (pasta salad, cheese, etc). We noticed the moment we got home and immediately returned to the store. I also tried calling customer service twice to let them know and it just rang, and rang, and rang with no answer.   Well, when we got back - they were already reshelving our items! My husband had to go around the store and track everything down.   Are you freaking kidding me? You're telling me that they don't even wait for people to return before putting PURCHASED items back to sell AGAIN? There's seriously not a location where they put these items to give the buyers a chance to return?!   It was honestly a span of 20 minutes. That's ridiculous."", ""Went because a friend ask me to meet her there. It lived up to all the bad reviews given. It was 7pm 3 people at the bar, bartender playing on her phone & talking to her friend at the end of the bar. No hello, can I get you something? After standing at the bar for a while she finally came over. I ordered a beer which she handed me unopened. I paid and walk to the table my friend and 3 others were sitting. At about 8pm 15 very young people walked in and had an even longer wait for her to even acknowledge there presence. I was guessing for Karaoke which doesn't start till 9pm. I left at 8:30pm. I have no idea how they stay in business and certainly don't know how she makes any money. Clearly the owner is not interested in making this a place to go. I went to the Old Double D many many years ago and I bet the original owner is glad he's gone-he should have never let them keep the name."", ""Two days here at the Eldorado with a group of 25 people. We have experienced the worse customer service . We just finished brunch and we're constantly badgered by our waitress about the number of people in our group. We were taking up too much space. She was a nice as a rattlesnake.  At 17 dollars per person I would think more is better. Food was ok but you will definitely not be welcomed or appreciated.

Broccoli was soggy, premium side spinach was rotten.  Bruschetta topped tilapia had only 8 small pieces of diced tomato on it. Salad bar was pretty much empty.   We've been to this location 4 times in the past year and have consistently left disappointed. Unless they drastically turn things around, we'll never go back."", ""The gelato may be very good, but I can't remember after such a negative dining experience.  With the exception of one person (the owner?) the staff were pretty missable.  Not a single smile to be had.  I don't expect my behind kissed, or even small talk, but I don't expect to give business to an establishment that hires people who seem bothered to be there.  There are three tables inside with ample room for a few more---not very family friendly.  Me, hubs and three children under 3 waited patiently for a table.  The icing on the cake was other customers---a lady practically climbed over my daughter to grab my hubs' seat when he got up to use the bathroom.  Seriously.  Not the establishment's fault, but all around poor attitude and rudeness abounded.  We won't be returning.  If you have children, pass on this place and enjoy ice cream at home.""]",2
12,"[""I went to Vegetate twice, and I will never go again. I went once on a Tuesday and got excited about the food prospects and wanted to try it all. I had a pita with tempura fried quinoa that was good, but dry without any tzatziki. I also had the green beans which were way too oily and I couldn't finish them.    The next day I went back in for food again and realized virtually nothing in the window had changed except there was less vegetable lasagna. This really concerned me as it was now 11:50 am and I didn't think a lot of people would have eaten it already. I then realized that probably none of this stuff was cooked very fresh and it was oily as a way to preserve it.   I got the vietnamese tofu sandwich with whole grain. They nuked it in a microwave and I had to wait five minutes for it to cool down. The bread was really dry and hard and flavorless. The tofu had no remarkable flavor, and the carrots were seemingly doused with chili to make the flavor of the whole thing. I couldn't eat the sandwich and ended up eating the tofu out of it and going to Joe for a croissant after to be full enough to wait for dinner.  The employee there was really not wanting to help in any way shape or form. She looked at me annoyed when I asked for a cup of water.  I paid cash which she looked at me annoying because she didn't get to just swipe a card and then when I had change of 1.09 she used one hand and slowly took out nine pennies using one hand acting like she couldn't even use the other hand because she didn't want to wash it again to go back to preparing food. When I asked if I could instead have a nickel and four pennies, she just looked at me and said \""\""no.\""\""  This was pretty ridiculous as the register had about 15 nickels in it and she just didn't want to be helpful.  I won't go back. There's Magic Carpet for vegetarian food at 34th and Walnut. I'll go there if I ever want something, they're cheaper, nicer and fresher. This place should close and be replaced with some place that wants to give fresher food and better customer service."", ""Very disappointed :( We came first thing in the morning, but we're rushed through because a group had appointments an HOUR later. The girl didn't clean out my toes, skipped my cuticles, and proceeded to BURN me with her callous sander. For four days I've been walking around with sander induced Blisters and they hurt like heck! She put two coats on my big toe and one on the other toes. The decor is nice, but the staff is unprofessional and need to be trained how to do nails without rushing. You won't get return customers with this level of service."", ""1  only because you can't give NO stars!  I do not think I have ever had a worse breakfast in my life!  I ordered a ham & cheese omelette with home fries and white toast. The menu says the omelette is made with 3 extra large eggs but it was clearly made with liquid egg product. The omelette was swimming in grill oil and absolutely tasteless!  The home fries had absolutely no seasoning and were equally as tasteless as the omelette. The only thing worse than the food was the conversation going on with the employees about someone's \""\""bloody bowel movement\""\""!  Do yourself a favor and keep on moving to the next breakfast place!"", ""Second night in a row at 2 Different LaQuintas, both times I am questioning whether the room has been cleaned properly, coffee stains and cup rings at one, and when I opened the door on the second, a piece of the heating/AC unit laying on the floor on one side of the bed and a empty to go cup on the other....needless to say, extremely disappointed"", ""Horrible customer service! Went into sprint explaining we didn't want a contract. Irvin assured us that they had a program that would fit what we are looking for. After having some issues with service, not receiving/sending text successfully and having the phones looked at with no success, as well as the fact you can't access data while on the phone hinders my productivity with work we opted to cancel service. We were told that with a lease all you would have to do is turn back in the phones at any time in good shape and you could cancel service. When we went to store they wanted $650 per line which totaled over $100 more than what the phone cost in order to break my \""\""contract\""\"". They then said well your not on a contract you are just committed to the phone for 24 months and there is a \""\""option to buy fee\""\"" you pay of you want to \""\""break your agreement\""\"". I explained that isn't what was explained to us. On top of that our 3rd phone is on a totally different payment option of installments. So that is a totally separate fee for cancellation even though it's on the same family plan. These people are shady, and if you go to a corporate store they will basically call this store the red headed step child of sprint, and of course will take no accountability even though they told us our account was totally incorrect and illogical the way it was set up. So don't trust what they say they will lie just to get you to sign the contract and after 14 days you are stuck."", ""Went with appointment for oil change. Arrived early. Oh you are next.

I literally saw the guy mixing a potato salad with his bare hands and then wipe his nose to return to mixing.   Years later, at their new location, I decided to give them another chance. I will concede they said they have a new cook this morning, but my oh my, the food was so bland and undercooked and just overall gross. It's bad enough that the environment is reminiscent of a garage sale turned restaurant - where the items were kept in their original condition by failing to clean them. But on top of that, it's just overall dirty.   Now, the icing on this dirty cake, is that the servers (if you can call them that) are not kind. They are unaware of the menu, they act like it's a burden to help. They need training. One guy was way more concerned with air drumming than attending to my drink order.   It's a bunch of young people, poorly trained, making gross food, in a dirty environment, where they're too cheap to provide real silverware or even a salt shaker. And WAY OVERPRICED. I got to pay $50 for my crap experience.   Seriously, let this place be overtaken by the mold that's likely growing in the corner of the room.   Thank you.

We finally left without ordering after waiting the 20 minutes only to have a couple walk in sit down and have a waitress come up and start taking their order. Horrible service.

First time I want to alter my zipper so it works better and widen my arm holes. Job was done, I did not see much of difference, zipper was still not working well and the arm holes were still tight but little better. Second time I went to Jin to alter the bottom part of my wedding dress. It was \""\""puffy\""\"" and I want to remove some material from it so it would be more flat. Jin agreed and she was very nice. She made very good impression on me although sometimes it was not so easy to understand her. Which we talked about and I understand since English is not my first language either. I came for first fitting and we both agreed on material to be removed. Jin quoted me final price. She kept saying it is so much work, so much work. That was little annoying already cause at the end of the day I was willing to pay as much as quoted for it and I was not happy with her saying that dress is fine. If I am not happy with it, it is not fine. I came for \""\""final fitting\""\"" and I was not happy. In my opinion not enough material was removed and Jin agreed it was her mistake so she would fix it. The last time I came was yesterday. I thought it was only for fitting so I did not bring money for payment. The dress was ready. I looked at it and my heart dropped. The front of dress had one quarter size BLOOD stain and one 5 times bigger BLOOD smudge right in front of my WHITE WEDDING DRESS. I am sure any women can emphasized with terror I felt. First Jin said she does not know what it is. Then she admitted it is blood and it happens all the time (!). No apologies. She came with Hydrogen Peroxide and cleaned the stains.... Now my dress smells great. She said it is fine cause I need to dry clean it either way cause she did not keep dress in garment bag and it is all dusty at the bottom! I got super upset cause dress was clean and ready to be wear on my wedding day that is next week! Anyway I just took dress and went to try it on. She kept saying it was so much work and it took her long and I understood that and I was ready to give her extra tip. But I was not saying anything cause 1) I was trying on the dress and 2) I was still so angry and not in mood for small talk. I came out, dress was ok. Jin was getting more and more angry cause she saw I was not too responsive. She told me she will never do this job again, it is not worth it, and no money from it, so long work. I understand all that but she quoted my price and she made a mistake. She knew what has to be done and she agreed to it. I do not understand why I have to be responsible here. The worst part was the end of visit when and sooooo uncalled for, she got so angry she started yelling at me cause I was still not happy about the stains. And she said she has no money from it and she will not pay for the stains she made. This was so disrespectful and not necessary. I decided instead of picking up dress today I would go back home for my wallet and just get it over with. She was still yelling when I left. I cried on my way home, my fianc\u00e9 went back with me cause I was so shaken. He was waiting outside (I did not want him to see dress). She was again rude and disrespectful, yelled so much I could not say word in between. I just asked her to please count the money cause I want to leave. She took money and I left.  I normally never add reviews with unpleasant experience cause I do not want to be reason of anyone losing business but I never was treated so disrespectfully in my life.

13,"[""After a long hiatus from reviewing I have awaken from my 6 mouth yelp hibernation and my tummies a grumbles with an insatiable hunger for the cacophonous symphony of flavor that is Indian food. Like an all too familiar pattern, I go back to Mohammad Butt, my main man for marsala. But whats this?  There are whispers that he no longer cooks for \""\""Best Taste of Asia,\""\"" that he is gone, never to return; some sort of falling out.  No. No, it can't be!  I need to score - one .. final .. hit..  Life ceases to have meaning, existential murmurings dog the mind. Who am I? Why am I here? What is Cheeze Wiz? Its done, over, a round falls into the chamber and just as I prepare to end it all and pull the trigger- steps in ZAIKA.  Zaika - meaning the art of taste -  stays to to its name. This is a place where the Paneer (cheese) is made fresh in house, resulting in a cheese that's silky in texture. Especially when in contrast to the prepackaged rubbery bone-white LEGO blocks most small Indo-Pak places purchase from Indian Grocers in attempts to reduce prep-times. While at Zaika such shortcuts are not taken,  the Chef takes the extra steps needed to ensure a dish comes together as a whole. For example, the Chicken Makhani uses Smokey Tandoori Chicken, which I have never seen done before but it certainly aids the chicken to cut though the rich buttery tomato sauce and elevates the dish as a whole. Even entr\u00e9es like Dall Fray or  Palak Paneer  have so much flavor that they will leave you not missing animal protein in the least should you choose to go the vegetarian route.   Zaika 's appetizers, like the Veggie Samosa and Aloo Tikki, (spiced potato patties) are generally large, peppery and well spiced - the latter of which remind me of something my own mother would make. Though I must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop-up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers, unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment. These peppers are spicy, not deveined or even seeded. Further, I find the fish pakora to be far too fishy.   I've become rather taken by Zaikia. Even the simply things such as the naan are good there. Just right in elasticity, the bread does not have too much give and yet isn't too soft. It's nothing elaborate, just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor. The only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has. But hey, I use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix, so I don't mind at all.  The menu has nearly 120 different items, all numbered to order by, making take-out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem. Furthermore, it has short descriptions of each dish - something all ethnic places like this should have. Though some items like Lassie (a frothy yogurt drink) do not appear on the menu, that too is offered - both a salty and sweet mango verities.  The head chef speaks English quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders.  I have already noticed parties negotiating catering for Ramadan as I anxiously awaited my own order.  The bottom line here is this, Mohammad Butt has expanded on the menu he once created for \""\""Best taste of Asia,\""\"" and taken an all HALAL meat approach.   Only good things can come of this, only good things.  P.S. ZAIKA is right behind Nifty Fifties on Grant Ave., so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake.  However, I would suggest getting the Ras Malai if available. These riccotta cheese dumplings flouting in soaked in sweetened, thickened milk are delicately flavored with cardamom, a very some amount of rose water and then garnished with pistachios. They are ungodly good."", ""You have not lived until you have tried their Bananas Foster French Toast.

Detailed Review: Updating after another positive experience at Maple Collision. It may seem odd to say that it's pleasant visiting a collision repair shop, but I know from experience that when they repair a vehicle it will look and function as good or better than before the incident occurred. That's very reassuring.  I have had the pleasure of speaking with Pete (the shop's owner), Ed, and Kathleen multiple times both on the phone and in person. I have spoken to on the phone, but have not yet met, Karen and Kevin, also multiple times. Everyone I have dealt with has been very professional, pleasant, and knowledgeable. Pete is very detail oriented and this shows in the way he runs the business as well as the finished product.  At Maple, everything is very upfront. The work required is explained in detail, and any questions are happily answered. During the repair process, communication is great, and the work is completed quickly. As for price, I shopped around quite a bit prior to my first visit, and found that Maple's pricing was right in line with what other shops in the area were charging. (I no longer shop around, as Maple's expertise and customer service keep me coming back.) When the work is done, everything is again explained in detail and questions are welcome.  This is the only body shop I'll go to or recommend to family/friends, whether the job is big or small and whether going through insurance or paying out of pocket.  Edit: Whenever I have taken a vehicle to Maple Collision, I've received a thank you note in the mail afterwards. Nice touch! See pics for most recent note.

With all your new neighboring restauranteurs in The Gulch, is this the taste of complacency? I shake my head in disappointment because I know your potential and cherish what we once had.   On the upside, my water was refreshing and the service was fine.""]",1

Aside from that, the people at the front desk could really care less. When we went up to go talk to them, they didn't even apologize. All they said was to wait HALF AN HOUR for the room to be cleaned. AND they offered us another room... A smaller one. For the same ridiculously priced rate.

While we were a little nervous about whether or not she could pull it off, on the day of the wedding they matched what we were wearing perfectly!  Besides her attention to detail, she was very helpful on the day of the wedding when she pinned all the boutonnieres and corsages herself. We were worried that we'd mess it up, but she was able to position and pin them perfectly on us! Not to mention when we decided at the last minute to create matching flower crowns for the bridesmaids, she said no problem and didn't even charge us extra for the short notice!

I said this is not what they had served me for the past 5 years and I never had requested a special order before.  I also asked what they had done to the phenominal soft tacos? They were usually served in a soft warm flour tortilla and had moisture and flavor. Tonight they were stale and crisp and the filing was bland.  Again he informed me I was mistaken while he held my order that had been sent back to the kitchen in front of me. I apologized and said I didn't wish for anything else, thank you. Another manager came out a few moments later apologizing and stated that they are unfamiliar with what I had ordered and would \""\""special order\""\"" anything I wanted. I declined.

I love lobster bisque and have had it at many upscale places, but this was the best I've ever had!  My wife does a plant based diet and had the butternut squash which was fantastic (I had some, too).

When he returned we were more than ready and began to order only to be advised that the BBQ grills at our table didn't work.!  Wouldn't it have been nice to tell us this when we were seated?  Since 90% of the menu items are BBQ, and that's the reason we came to this restaurant instead of the other local Korean restaurants, we asked to move to a BBQ table that worked.  We waited 15 more minutes and were seated at another table with one grill and placed the order, 7:45 at this point.  All the food came out but many of us  waited eagerly for food since they are grilling for 8 people on one small grill.  Finally everyone is served but then we sit for 20 more minutes waiting for someone to check back, offer boxes or the check.  They actually didn't ever come until one of us got up and requested it and it still took a while.  All in all a disaster of a night and will never go back.

The new owners wouldn't recognize the 10 classes, but we can each have $85 credit.

Third, the food was loaded with salt. My husband has high blood pressure so this was a major concern to me. I took a few bites but didn't finish and definitely didn't bother to take home. You cannot enjoy the flavor of the food because everything was drowning in salt. Gross. Fourth, our bill was extremely high. This food was definitely over priced for the quality.

The owner was very friendly and seems to really care about ensuring everyone has a good experience.  My only recommendation would be that since its 3 tacos for $9, it would be cool to be able to add a 4th or maybe 5th taco for a discounted price for people who have big appetites.

And heaven forbid you need to take a bathroom break, or need a beverage! You don't get to PAUSE your time for ANYTHING. They didn't even have a server, so if you're hoping to have a couple beers, better get ready to run quick and get them yourself. The lane even malfunctioned a couple times, but there's no time to wait for a service worker to fix it, because they don't bother extending the time you've lost.

After being abandoned multiple times while they went to \""\""go look for me\""\"" and then found these same associates helping other customers I decided to go up to the customer service desk to seek assistance. When I arrived there they also had no idea why their computers showed 3 items in stock but couldn't find them still. Ok so I begrudgingly agreed to have a new item shipped to the store (they couldn't figure out how to ship it to the store closest to me so I again, beaten down, acquiesced to driving down to this much further store to get the item I wanted.) I was told we'll have the item here in 1-2 days. Great. Fast forward to 5 days later. The store has no idea where the new item is. I wish I was making this up, but it gets better! They have no idea where it is! And tell me the order had actually been canceled on their end. But... it's in stock at another store even further away! I leave upset but determined to get my item. Fast forward. I'm now at the other store with the receipt for my initial purchase which was refunded because they could not find the item. Which shows a discounted price for my troubles. The other store now says they can't match the price of the original store because that was a discount they gave me and they are different stores. So finally I gave up and went else where.

As I walked out three security guards approached me and starting harassing me. They told me to leave (which I was on my free will already)... I questioned why they were harassing me and they threw me on the ground, improperly handcuffed me (which is illegal),screamed at me, called me a \""\""fat mother f'er\""\"" \""\""Bitch\""\"" \""\""that's what you get\""\"" among other obscenities, and proceeded to call the pinellas county sheriffs department. All this happened on a public sidewalk 20 yards away from the business. They left bruises and marks all over my body, injured my knee to the point I'm limping, ripped my shirt, and broke my glasses. They made up a story that I tried to hit a bartender (mind you I tipped 25% and was having a good night. Plus I'm not even a violent person). The police showed up shortly after all this... I was illegally detained and released after they concluded I did nothing wrong...I was trespassed verbally from the property due to this and asked to leave. If I truly assaulted someone like the security claimed I did I would have been arrested. They're aggressive and had no right to assault me.   I called after this all happened and asked to speak to the owner to try and comprehend what happened. Brooke answered the phone. I asked her why I was assaulted and I asked for the video of what happened. She responded with \""\""you've been trespassed and get a subpoena if you want the video\""\"".

Their injera was a disgrace!  As some other reviewers have noted, it was slightly dried out and the edges were crusty!  To top it off, the veggie items were maybe lukewarm, at best, and pretty bland for Ethiopian cuisine.

But all of the salads are a good sized portion with lots of goodness in them.  You can't go wrong with any of the salads.  The sandwiches are all also great - my husband loves the Frenchie, I love the Mermaid or the regular chicken salad sandwich or the Fa La La... YUM, the breads are all made in house.

I changed my apartment within the Lincoln Green as the water from the yard had destroyed the wall. The wall was wet for 3-4 month and the management failed fix it regardless of multiple inquiries. Finally they offered me to move to another apartment and did not compensate for the time and moving expenses. They did not even decrease the rate of the new apartment at least to the rate that I had been paying for the old one.   2. My expensive bicycle was stolen from the second floor balcony. All my attempts to ask for reasonable increased security in the community was useless.   3. When my rent was over, I washed the carpets and had one of the office employees come to inspect the apartment and sign off on my lease termination. I had about 100 Dollars security deposit that I never received back and because of my busy schedule, I did not really care to follow. However, a few years after, I noticed a \""\""Collection Notice\""\"" on my credit report. As I investigated that, I realized that the Lincoln Green Apartment had reported me to Collection Agency for what they said \""\""  150 Dollars fee for not washing the carpet\""\"". They had never contacted me although they had my new address, email, and phone number. They reported me to collection agency for only 50 dollars. When I contacted them, I faced bunch of rude people with no respect, what so ever, to a customer. As soon as they realized that I am not looking for rent, they hung up the phone on me.   4. If you walk (not jump) in your apartment or watch TV after 9 pm, don't be surprised to get a knock on the door by your neighbors.   Two of my friends who also lived in Lincoln Green Apartments had similar experience.  I strongly discourage renting the Lincoln Green Apartments for the following reasons:   1. Disrespectful and rude employees and managers 2. Their abuse of having the SSN of the tenants. 3. Their inadequate care for apartment issues 4. Poor security.  5. Very poor sound proofing of the walls which transmits every single sound to all neighbors.

Highly recommend!"", ""This is one of the WORST venues I've been too and definitely won't be coming back. I came here over the weekend to see Primus and I was so disappointed in both the layout of the place and the people that worked there. First the security at the door was confused, they took our tickets and then walked back in the place, leaving us outside. When he finally decided to return he actually asked us for our tickets (even though he took them with him). After rummaging through his pockets...tada! He found them and finally let us in.  We were escorted upstairs to the bar & restaurant where we were told they were out of food menus and they would give us one when it came available...so that's when the waiting game began. We waited about 10 minutes for a menu and then it took about 15 minutes for someone to circle back around and take our order. After placing our order it took them over 30 minutes to make one chicken caesar wrap. Once we finally got our food they proceed to \""\""kick us out\""\"" because they needed to get the top floor ready for the show - so frustrating! The night continued to go just as frustrating. The layout of this place is rectangular and very long so if you don't get there early and man your spot, good looking getting a glimpse at the stage. They cram over 1000 people in this small club and if it wasn't for the TV screens people would have missed the show entirely. I feel horrible for about 70% of the people that came to watch the show, there is really no good seat in the house. Also their security is absolutely horrible, they were constantly rushing through the crowds to stop people from smoking or taking pictures. When they weren't shoving you to get through they were shining a flashlight in your eyes. We also had security shove us out of the way so he could stand in front of us and take video himself of the band that was playing. They are so unprofessional and rude. If you plan on going to see a show here, I wouldn't recommend it especially if there's going to be a lot of people and a sold-out show because chances are you won't see anything. And I'm serious when I say it that only about 30% of the ticket holders could see anything, the rest of us were just standing around watching the TV screens.

I took one bite and ended up spitting out the chicken..  I just couldn't believe that an establishment would serve this....i assume no one in the kitchen samples the food before it comes out... they just cant... there is no way someone could think its okay to serve such dry tasteless food.

So for starters - I ordered the lobster roll. The dish was not to my liking, but that's because I'm not a fan of celery in lobster rolls. The celery was diced but it was too much and it overpowered the dish. I also found the lobster overdressed. But some of this is just a matter of taste so I won't ding them hard for that.  The rest of the food, given the price, was fantastic. The crab and lobster were all fresh, all cooked correctly, and all at a price that worked.   It is rare to find a seafood restaurant these days that is reasonably priced and one that serves fresh good seafood. Most are either way too expensive or way too sucky.

I have short hair, and not much of it so it looked like a really pissy move.

Maybe that's not fair. I have yet to sample all of their fare, and perhaps it's a bad idea to fit them into the mold that Mugshots (which was gone before I arrived in Manayunk) occupied. But in the end, they call themselves a cafe, which translates into a coffee shop, moved into the location of a former coffee shop and they include baked goods and coffee on the menu, so I feel comfortable in holding them to some standard.  They were out of their banana bread. All of it. For all the flavors they described, they didn't have a single one left when I arrived. This is a significant portion of their menu, and they were out of all of it, which tells me that they have problems with keeping things in stock They had plenty of Baklava, but I'm allergic to two of the nuts they use in them, so even experimenting is a horrible idea.  There was a small child running around screaming, and I could hear arguing breaking out as I stepped through the door with my coffee. I'm not saying that without empathy, but that is never something you want your customers getting to be a part of. Even if the food had been perfect, it would have detracted from the experience  And...the coffee...I have to  go back to that. I really do. If I has handed a mug of Starbucks and was told that someone had urinated in it, and my only other option was what I had here...I would seriously have to debate that decision. This is a horrible thing to say. It's cruel, and cruel honestly isn't that much more helpful than well meaning lies. It's even more horrible to look at in the cold light of day, and determine that it's still a correct assessment. But this is someone who, during his broke college days, would drink coffee through day old grounds. Someone who used an abandoned French press that was held together with duct tape, and I couldn't finish it. Seriously, it was that bad. I don't know how they did it, and that cup was an accomplishment in of itself.  Maybe the owners are nice folk. Maybe, their Mediterranean food is really good, as other reviews seem to indicate. But they sure as shit ain't a cafe. If they want to be cheery, and have great falafel, they should do that.

And then there was the food, excellent presentation and great taste.  Can't ask for more.  Beats the pants out of 99% of the places in DC, particularly in their pet friendly atmosphere.    In DC, they have a fence around the al fresco dining tables and in the 1% of restaurants that allow Fido, pets are only allowed outside the fence, which means literally out on the street.  Phoey on that.  The brunch food at Slate was outstanding.  Two of us had the steak and eggs, both cooked to perfection.  One of us had the French Toast with an apple confite.  And yet another had the scrambled eggs with ham.  That was also good.  Lastly, my BF had the eggs benedict and he was licking his fingers.  Overall I was impressed with this place as far as Brunch goes.  They did their very best on all fronts, and are richly deserving of the only 5-star I've given this year."", ""great Chinese food.

I've had past experiences where you enter an establishment which claims they are Vietnamese and turned out to be Chinese and that's another story.   Onto the food, we ordered an original and a grill chicken banh mi. Very authentic and large in size which made it a very good deal. Very tasty and stuffed with meats and veggies.

Meanwhile, a gentleman\u200b came and offered us food that we never ordered... guess he meant to go to a different table.   When our appetizers\u200b came, another woman yelled out \""\""avocado rolls\""\"" *doesn't wait for anyone to claim them, she just puts them on the table* \""\""Shrimp roll\""\"" *slides on table*, \""\""Shrimp\u200b and pork roll\""\"" *slides on table* and then 1 of 3 drinks arrives and it just go slam dab in the middle of the table with no regard\u200b as to who ordered it. Generally, its bad enough to offer food to a table, waiters should always know who ordered what, but to just throw it on the table like that is straight RUDE!!!!!!  Two of the other drinks came after the food (just generally a bad standard of service to have food come before drinks).   Food finally came, and it was fine. Employees were too busy to even clear tables to seat parties waiting at the door. The kicker was, they sat two parties of two at a table of four.... basically, \u200bthese poor people had to share a table that is normally just a table for 3-4, not a communal table.   My friends and I already discussed tipping at or below 15% for the sh*t service (was taking way too long to get our table cleared and our check) but we noticed a 20% gratuity added to the bill because they add that for parties of four or more (literally\u200b nowhere on earth adds the charge for 4+, its always at minimum 6+, and some places even do 18% not 20%).   I asked a waitress to take it off because it is illegal to force a customer to pay \""\""gratuity\""\"" and she argued with me for a minute before taking it off. Oh and also the gratuity is included in the tax calculation so you pay tax on the gratuity... ALSO ILLEGAL!!   Scammy business with trash servers who literally\u200b do not give a crap about their job. I would only go back if the automatic gratuity was removed and the service improves. Obviously, \u200bit affects\u200b the work ethic of the waiters because they know they automatically get 20% in the bag if a table of 4+ comes in and therefore\u200b lose motivation to provide good service."", ""Absolutely worst Hertz location!!!!

I ordered the pork weiner schnitzel which by itself can be two meals, They don't have a kids menu but they make fresh chicken nuggets or tenders for them. Along with the dinner you get a choice of either soup or salad. my wife usally gets the salad which has beets,beans and the such. I had the tomato soup which was the best ever, it was homemade it even had a couple of ground up tomato seeds, The only draw back to the meal were the potatoe's , they weren't crisp enough but still rated a 3.9 out of a 5.   The biggest surprise was the apple straddle. As I said we have been going there about twice a year for a long while. Every time we went to order the apple straddle they were out, and always got the same response its the first dessert to sell out, We saw why once we took our first bite, My daughter who didn't want to try it at first, finally decided to try a bite after there was only one bite left and said OMG that is the best ever.

Definitely very authentic and very good."", ""Inedible & FDA Beware!   Le Saigon wins the #1 prize of being the most inconsiderate, rude, and unsafe restaurant on the main line.  The produce, meats, and other ingredients used by the owner of Le Saigon is cheap, expired, and extremely unsafe.  The food is horribly prepared and lacks any flavor.    The service is rude.  I bet you Le Saigon will have the same fate at Yangming, that is, it will be shut down by the FDA.    An embarrassment to the Main Line restaurants.""]",13
31,"[""I really had a wonderful experience at the Nashville location, and we found out that New Orleans had one now and should go to it. Last night we got there kinda late around 10pm. Sat there for 10min and not one person greeted us. Went to the bar to see about service and she informed that the kitchen was behind on completing orders.  I had to apologize to my friends that we may not get any food after driving three hours down to enjoy the weekend. We did end up leaving the restaurant after 25 min wait for no service or an apology.   I have to say this not what I expected from a big known place for adults to have fun along with kids also. Please do something about this. I hope this is not a reflection of how others could become."", ""This place is horrible. Do not get bottle service.  The bottles are over priced and the waitresses poor drinks extremely strong so you have to purchase another bottle. They will also charge you for more than you purchased, thinking that you are too drunk to realize. The manager comped us for their mistake but still made us feel that we were wrong. I was not impressed."", ""This place is great, even for vegetarians.  The food is fresh and delicious.  The sauces are fantastic.  The staff are courteous and helpful.  My daughter and son-in-law live in nearby Lansdale and it seems as if we stop here for a meal at least once every time we visit them."", ""I've been 3 times, so I think I can share a fair judgement.  This business is a lot of show, without the go.   Service has been the overall department that has been completely lacking along with some breakfast items are products of horrible cooking.  First time: asked for black coffee and a matcha latte, dad didn't get his coffee until our food already arrived (which also seemed to take forever) and I actually never received my matcha latte after asking and reminding waiters more than eight times, 8!!! It got to be comical, which is why we counted.  By the end of our breakfast they finally offered it to me in it as a to go drink and still had the audacity to charge me for it, so I said no.  Second visit, was dinner with friends, this was a much more pleasant experience, there was four of us, we shared a bottle of wine and I remember I liked my food. No complaints here. Third time, was another breakfast round... I'm not sure what it is about breakfast but I don't think they do a good job for breakfast. To start with, we were given menus for both breakfast and lunch, which was appreciated, but no drink menus and we were specifically interested in mimosas or Bloody Mary's etc. because we didn't know what to order, or what was our options were... my dad ordered a Bloody Mary, and I ordered a Mimosa. I only mention this because it was frustrating to see other people have different variations of mimosas and also bloody mary's, other breakfast cocktails which we didn't even know existed.  My dad ordered a ham and cheese omelette with his side of home fries. I ordered the power bowl muesli.  We got through two drinks before the food came, which actually was a long time. By the time our food came, the order was wrong - my dad had fruit, but no home fries as he requested.  We immediately let our server know, and she said she would go grab them.  Additionally, our plates were extremely bland.  Just an omelette, no garnish or sides at all (other than the fruit in the side bowl.  The plates just looked sad.  Also, I could tell by looking at the omelette it wasn't good, that's how bad it was, and my dad concurred.  The wait staff failed to bring his home fries in any kind of fast or quick manner, so we reminded our bartender, who then reminded to server, once my dad got a refill on his coffee we also then reminded that server as well.  We ate through the entire meal, never got the home fries, and in the end right as our check was being delivered we mentioned the homefries again, and that's when the bartender sent a server running for them, and as we were signing our check is when they came out and were offered as a \""\""to go\""\"" option.  While a simple side, it was really disappointing to go the entire breakfast with an awkward feeling of  \""\""I guess they just don't care\""\"" and instead of comping anything, the manager offered me a $15 off coupon the next time we came in.  It's just hard to ever want to come in again... and didn't feel like an adequate apology on a $45 breakfast.  And lastly my dads omelette tasted like McDonalds.  Only upside was that my muesli power bowl was delicious, just hard to believe it took as long as it did to come out or that anything cost as much as it did with as horrible of service and lack of \""\""care\""\"" put behind anything that was done there."", ""TERRIBLE FOOD TERRIBLE SERVICE! I never complain, but had to warn others... The place looked nice, till we got our waiter who was apparently an american coach from Brooklyn lol.... He repeatedly shoved at us the 2 most expensive meals on the menu even though we just wanted tacos. The tacos were the size of half dollars and bare.  Highly disappointing and both my boyfriend and I were sick all night."", ""We have been ordering from them for about a year. Their prices are decent and the food has usually always been great. My wife loves the poppers and we both love the chicken tenders.  The owner seems like he really cares about the customers. We had a few mistakes in our orders over the years and the owner is very apologetic and fixes the problem right away."", ""Good food, but to me it's not worth the horrible service or the rude staff, and they only take cash or checks and there's not even a sign at the front stating so; the sign is at their cash register all the way in the back on a wall not facing the dining room. I'm not very picky and I'm never rude, so this says a lot: horrible experience."", ""Excellent place to get a tattoo. I have had two done at B13 and am really pleased with both. One was with a group of people and the owner was able to fit all 4 of us in with a great sketch on really short notice. If you aren't sure who to go to, I've seen especially awesome work by Amanda, though everyone is great I'm sure."", ""Long wait but definitely worth it. Biscuits are on point!  If you're looking for good chicken, biscuits and honey look no further!  Bonus, they are everywhere."", ""Ate brunch at Kanella today, the first time we have been there.  It really was a relaxing fun experience.  The service from Bill was great, just enough with out being patronizing.  We put him on the spot and basically made him order, everything was great, the rabbit soup with Fava beans was fantastic----wish I could get the recipe out of the vault.  We will return again, with a hearty appetite for really good food."", ""Amazing fresh authentic food. My favorite beef pie. You have to stop by and try this place. You won't regret it."", ""We came to eat last night with a pretty large party (9 people).  Being in a large party in a busy restaurant, you expect things to take a bit longer than normal. We were fine with that, given that this place came highly recommended.  We were seated within about 30 minutes, which was not bad given how busy they are. After sitting there for about 25 minutes, we had yet to be approached by a waiter. We let the hostess know and she sent a waiter over to us. He said that he would bring us all waters and be right back.   Around this time, another large party was seated at the table next to us. They appeared to have 7 people, which was confirmed when the waiter brought our waters to their table and mysteriously ended up with 2 extra glasses... A minute or two after that, a different waiter showed up and apologized, saying there was a mixup with the table assignments.  We figured that it'd be a good idea to go ahead and order while we actually had somebody's attention and placed our appetizer, food and drink orders and asked for waters. That waiter was never seen or heard from again, though... 20 more waterless minutes passed (45 minutes in total by this point) and we were tired of waiting..  To add insult to injury, though, the other large table that I mentioned had their drinks and appetizers delivered just then.  One person from our party approached the manager to complain and was basically just told, \""\""we're busy\""\"". Yes, restaurants get busy and food may take a while, but 45 minutes and not even water? Needless to say, we just left and enjoyed a very good meal at Coop's Place a few blocks down.  It's not often that I feel compelled to leave a review, but this is definitely one of those occasions. It's funny how many reviews over the past year or two echo the exact same problems we experienced last night. You would expect management to take corrective actions, but I suppose they don't care as long as butts are still being put in seats."", ""I once went to this Gavi and it was fine.  Second time though it was mostly empty, sat down, waited 15 minutes without service and left.  Haven't been going back and have been telling everyone I know not to go there."", ""Twice I have wanted to order through the Internet and twice it has not worked. The first time I never even got my order. The second time I called and was told, \""\"" oh yeah that happens\""\"". And then, if you want to order it will be well over an hour for a pizza. WTF? This is pathetic. I really want to support locally owned businesses but not like this. I will gladly walk to Theo's and get a pizza before I try these guys again. Too bad, you're ruining local,business. I will NEVER EVER ORDER AGAIN."", ""I been to a lot of places but this place was gross. I am sorry to say but there was hair in my good and the waitress was rude."", ""We stayed here for a long weekend last year. 2 kids, 1 a toddler and we had a great time. All the restaurants were good. My son and husband had fun at the arcade. Hubs enjoyed gambling. My favorite hotel in Reno."", ""Was recommended by a friend to eat here while visiting town for a graduation. Was not disappointed, food was exceptional and service excellent. The chips are made on site and were the best chips I have ever had! I ordered the tacos, one cod and one steak. I liked the steak one best. My nephew had the short ribs and they were great. I would order those if I went again. Very unique menu. Be prepared for the fact that there is no outside signage. It was a little hard to find."", ""As an active runner my shoes are my life force. Endurance House has a fantastic selection of shoes for all runners.  The staff are always nice and helpful. What sets them apart from other stores is how they check for what shoe will best suit your stride and reduce injury.  I will happily keep coming back and know that I will get a good price, a great pair of shoes, and have personalized help."", ""So we walked in and a 45min wait, yeah that's not happening but there was open seating in the bar, which we took. We were told 45min for the pie as it takes that long to cook, which is standard for Chicago style. We ordered the ravioli app and beers and were impressed from there. Watching the guys and gals through the window throwing the dough and seeing the process was eat-tainment. The pie came and for 4 grown men, we couldn't put down a large it was too much.  100% we will be back."", ""If you're from NY or north jersey then these bagels cannot compare to those bagels. Night and day. These bagels are huge tough dough balls. They are no better than what you'd get at a grocery store.

32,"[""THE BEST SANDWICHES IN STL, if not the Midwest!  The Sicilian is easily top on my list, but each and every menu option is a steal. The prices are more than fair for the decent portions being served into your mouth via each sandwich.   The staff is always friendly, quick, and they're all huge music and STL sports fans. It doesn't get any better than that.   Even though I work right down the street and get a simple turkey sandwich half of the time, it's still better than any other lunch option in the city.   Blues city will always be a staple in my diet no matter where I decide to live as my life moves forward. Go Blues!"", ""I definitely won't be coming back here. Long story short, I scheduled an appointment online to have the transmission and differential fluid changed on my pilot. I arrived on time, and I was told it would take approximately 2 hours for completion, I also said I wanted an oil change, but \""\"" full synthetic\""\"". He said it would be $20 more, I said okay. When it was finally done and I was ready to check out, my advisor (Brandon) give me the total cost, which was double than what I expected and paid for in the past. I asked him what was all done, he said, \""\""they completed a transmission flush instead of the regular drain and refill\""\"". I told him that's not what I wanted or asked for. He went on to say \""\""it was good for the car and whatever\""\"", like I'm some kind of idiot. First of all Honda doesn't recommend doing a transmission flush and secondly, its almost triple what you would normally pay for a standard transmission fluid change. On top of that they didn't even do a full synthetic oil change it was just a blend. I didn't have time to argue with him because I was already late for an appointment, but I have the email showing what I originally asked for, so I'll be calling my bank soon."", ""Very nice dining experience! I loved almost every dish we ordered. Artichoke salad is the best!!! I would love to come back :) Yes, I am not just a Chinese food fan, also an Italian food lover lol"", ""Horrible, I wish we read the reviews before going in, what a downer this place was!  Let us sit for an hour and then brought out cold food.  My two grand sons were with and they were pinging off the wall by the time the cold food got to our table.   I have literally been to iHops all over and hands down this was the worst experience we have ever had.  Generally I think of iHop as a safe bet while traveling, but this may have ruined that rep for good."", ""I would really like to try this place but every time I show up they are unexpectedly closed! The first time I showed up I was told they were closed for a Spring Spruce up and would be open on the 11th. I left a little annoyed because there was no indication of this on their website, which I had used to look them up and browse the menu. I later discovered they had something up on their Facebook page about being closed, but seeing as those I don't have a Facebook, this was of no benefit to me. Today (March 15th) I drove all the way over only to discover a sign on the door stating they will be closed the remainder of the week! This time I checked their Facebook and there was no information regarding the extended closure. In fact it was a bit confusing because they had posts advertising the re-opening and even pictures posted of people eating there for a brunch event just the other day. Is this some kind of secret society of delicious eatery? I really wish I knew. Poor communication on the businesses side of things has made me feel like I probably won't be giving these guys a try. If I do muster up the fortitude to drive clear across town again I will definitely be calling ahead to make sure they are open. I suggest you do the same."", ""The Owner is just as rude & crazy as the manager.  He refuses to listen to employee's & customer complaints.  I'd stay FAR away from this place.  Even the Spring Hill owner said people call his store complaining about the manager at Little Road.  Other employees I spoke with said she's awful to work for and people complain about her all of the time.  They fired a waitress for not being able to come in on her OFF day due to the flooded roads.  She WASN'T scheduled that day.  I'm calling the news stations,BBB & the Labor Board since the owner won't listen either.  I hope people hear this story and boycott your business!

The only good thing about this trip was the mozzarella sticks. 2 shakes and 2 sides for $15, no thanks."", ""We had an excellent night wine tasting. We had the introductory package. It was an excellent taste of two white and three reds for only $10.  This was my second trip there and I plan to go again with more people."", ""Such great food! The chef was creative and innovative, while still staying true to traditional Hispanic/Latino cuisines. The yuca fries were crispy and delicious, the empanadas were great, and the skirt steak w/ polenta was seriously the best thing I've eaten in a while. My sister is a vegetarian and often has a hard time finding good options when we go out, so she was delighted to see a variety of great choices (the mushroom empanadas were her favorite!).

Once we stepped foot into Plat 99 I realized that we had found the place.  Though a little pricey, the bar has elements that bring us back, and back, and back.  The decor is gorgeous. I first encountered the bar in the winter where a group of girls met and took advantage of the huge windows and comfy couches inside. The glass lamps (I am told there are 99) are breathtaking. The drinks were amazing, albeit expensive, but worth it. The servers bring truffle oil popcorn. Oh yeah. It is as good as it sounds.  I had no idea that I could like the place more until I discovered the outdoor spring/summer space.  The large outdoor area is perfect for sitting and enjoying the elements.  The view is not fabulous, but endearing.  The servers are fantastic...we soon got to know a few of them and they are so friendly and quick to greet you.  They make your experience even better.  This is the \""\""local plus\""\"" to me...the elegance of a upscale lounge with the midwestern hospitality.  Fabulous.  The servers certainly create an environment that makes one want to return."", ""This was my first time here and I can say I wasn't disappointed. Though it was questionable as to whether I'd be able to get in the restaurant as the door latch mechanism broke and nobody could get in or out. A Good Samaritan diner helped them get the door open finally but it was quite funny!   I'm glad I waited for the door because the food was wonderful; great flavors and plenty left over. The spring rolls were fresh and tasty and the Mongolian bed was spot on, not too spicy but certainly not bland. The sesame chicken is some of the best I've tasted in years with a great balanced sauce, not too sweet and very nicely crisped chicken. I'm looking forward to another visit for the pho.""]",14

I checked my size one more time, confirmed, and left to let them do their thing. When I came to pick up later that afternoon, the ring was too small. It's very important to note that Shalimar sized the ring perfectly, but that I made a mistake and should've gone up a half-size. The Shalimar group were completely understanding and accommodating, even resizing my ring back up and getting it back to me within an hour at no charge! Even though it was my mistake!

We didn't really waste too much time after getting engaged (February) to tie the knot, so planning was a little hectic, to say the least.  From the beginning, every single person I spoke to at PPR was courteous, helpful and accommodating. Initially, I placed my order with Mike and even made a few changes over email with him as well, which was wonderful. I even had a mini panic attack, the day before, over having a tent. (Early August being very hot, I had hesitation about having a tent at all as we were trying to save as much money as possible...My mother in law, being the voice of reason, told me that the tent was already cleaned and ready to go, so it went up and saved us from the showers we had the morning of the reception) I felt so silly about it later. My mother in law had also spoken to them a few times to add items to our order and commented on how pleasant they were to work with and how easily they went over the order with her and made changes.  Preferred Party Rentals is wonderful and I would absolutely work with them again... ...minus the breakdown. :)"", ""One of the best burgers I've ever had!

The decor is cozy and up-scale, with small round tables surrounded by tall couches to sit on.

Final note on excellent customer service:  Shawn realized that we had left one of the wine bottles we purchased in the rear storage of his van and called me on my cell phone to make arrangements for delivery so that I returned home with every item I had purchased on the tour.  Many thanks, Shawn!  If you have any interest in learning more about wine in general or the 110 vineyards in the Santa Ynez Valley, then call Wine Edventures immediately.  This is money well spent."", ""Meet by a great hostess at the door, Jenna. Her smile was amazing! Drinks at the bar were rather good.  They actually have a loco moco! BOOM!"", ""This place is just awful. Great atmosphere, but food is just plain bad. I've given it too many tries. Done."", ""I absolutely loved this place when i first started and still do but won't be going back.  They did not honor something they told me they would. I won't go into much detail as they know the problem. I don't know what happened in the last few months but it is completely gone down fast. They are unorganized and all over the place. They got rid of their best trainers. They don't seem to be very loyal to their older clients that have been there since day 1."", ""Mailed a poster-specifically asked the guy to tape the c ends of the poster tubes- he said he would -well the package arrived to the recipient empty-went to file claim-the owner seemed disinterested  in helping me-in fact it seemed he had no clue about anything -no urgency  in providing any customer service- it's been a month and I've been back and forth trying to get a resolution -not a one of the people seem to know anything , follows up on the situation -I've  done everything  I've  been asked to do and provide-terrible service-im about to lose my shit - it's maddening -DO YOUR JOB-IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE"", ""Someone needs to find out who's in charge of greeting diners as they walk in to this place. I stood for almost 10 minutes as 2 employees failed to show me to a table. The first employee to see me hardly even glanced at me, let alone attempt to greet me. He was seating 2 ladies just as I walked in so I assumed he would be right back to seat me. Bad assumption. Luckily, there was a second employee serving a table nearby who asked if I had been taken care of yet. When I told her I had not, she disappeared for a minute, only to return to reassure me that it would only be a couple of minutes longer for me to wait to be seated, presumably not by her since she was roaming around in plain sight the whole time. 5 or more minutes of standing alone in the entrance way later, I walk up to the outdoor seating area and find the first employee opening a bottle of wine at a table. After seeing him glance at me out of the corner of his eye, and still not even making eye contact or asking me what he could do for me, I stand and stare for a minute while he works, only to find that second reassuring employee finally peek through and open the door. She proceeds to ask me IF I would like to be seated. Now from where I'm standing it should have been abundantly obvious that I was waiting to be seated, but rather than admit an error on their part, she would have me believe she wasn't sure. Now I don't believe either of them meant any malice towards me, but first of all the assumption should be that someone standing with their arms crossed in the entrance should be waiting to be seated, unless they've said otherwise, and in any case shouldn't they be asked? If there were a host stationed at that entrance this could have been avoided, but as it went, no one knew that I wasn't being served and no one did enough to try and find that out. ~feeling let down."", ""We tried this place because it was new to the area and we like to give new businesses a chance. When we walked in, the hostess seemed very a bit aloof to what was going on. After being sent to our table by the window, we ordered our food. My son ordered a chocolate chip pancake (with the chips just thrown on top and not even added to the batter) and my wife ordered a fish sandwich that looked like it was straight out of a bag from target. Then my we ordered a kids meal for my toddler and the nuggets were the same ones that you buy from the supermarket. Not only was the food store bought, we all got sick after our meal!! Not even an hour after we left my son and wife were running to the restroom. Extremely disappointed and disgusted with this place. I never enjoy giving negative reviews, but this needed to happen. STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!!"", ""There is not much to say about Joes or \""\""Chinks\""\"" if your a long time local. It is a little more expensive than other local cheesesteaks, but you know what your paying for. The meat is much higher quality than most places. I have had plenty of Philly cheesesteaks. Genos, Pats, Tony Luke's, Jim's....... still prefer joes over any of those."", ""This place moved locations and when I placed a call in order the guy on the phone didn't even tell me or give me a heads up! I called to find out the new location and he gave me wrong directions! I was super bummed! No thanks!

The continental breakfast was fresh homemade assortment. The managers/owners Jennifer and Greg are very accommodating and friendly."", ""I ordered the 1st day they were open from grubhub for carryout. They accepted my order and said it was ready before I walked in. I walked into the restaurant and not only was my order not ready, but everyone who ordered at the counter getting their meal before mine, and they were getting it for half price.   I watched 9 people come in, order, and get their food before me, but pay half what I did because I ordered online. I sat there for 45 minutes despite the fact that I ordered ahead of everyone else there, paid double what they did for their food, and was confirmed that the order was ready.  I was apologized to frequently for the wait, but at no point was I offered any explanation as to why I waited 9 times longer than those ordering at the counter, or why they told grubhub it was ready, or why it was charged at twice the price as at the counter (delivered I would understand, but I picked it up).   I live a block and a half away (315 N Senate). I had hoped it would be a place that I could carry out from often, but I was thoroughly disappointed. All said, the food was OK, but the experience was absolutely horrible. Due to that experience I would recommend either Bento Asian (mostly Japanese, $2.50 delivery) or the China King at 148 N Deleware (free delivery) for Asian delivery or carry-out. DO NOT ORDER HERE FROM GRUBHUB OR ANY OTHER CARYOUT/DELIVERY APP/SITE."", ""We walked in with every intention to spend a good amount of money on souvenirs.

They said they were understaffed and there was staff sitting in the dining room on laptops. The salsa was very bland.

We will be back"", ""This is one of the WORST venues I've been too and definitely won't be coming back. I came here over the weekend to see Primus and I was so disappointed in both the layout of the place and the people that worked there. First the security at the door was confused, they took our tickets and then walked back in the place, leaving us outside. When he finally decided to return he actually asked us for our tickets (even though he took them with him). After rummaging through his pockets...tada! He found them and finally let us in.  We were escorted upstairs to the bar & restaurant where we were told they were out of food menus and they would give us one when it came available...so that's when the waiting game began. We waited about 10 minutes for a menu and then it took about 15 minutes for someone to circle back around and take our order. After placing our order it took them over 30 minutes to make one chicken caesar wrap. Once we finally got our food they proceed to \""\""kick us out\""\"" because they needed to get the top floor ready for the show - so frustrating! The night continued to go just as frustrating. The layout of this place is rectangular and very long so if you don't get there early and man your spot, good looking getting a glimpse at the stage. They cram over 1000 people in this small club and if it wasn't for the TV screens people would have missed the show entirely. I feel horrible for about 70% of the people that came to watch the show, there is really no good seat in the house. Also their security is absolutely horrible, they were constantly rushing through the crowds to stop people from smoking or taking pictures. When they weren't shoving you to get through they were shining a flashlight in your eyes. We also had security shove us out of the way so he could stand in front of us and take video himself of the band that was playing. They are so unprofessional and rude. If you plan on going to see a show here, I wouldn't recommend it especially if there's going to be a lot of people and a sold-out show because chances are you won't see anything. And I'm serious when I say it that only about 30% of the ticket holders could see anything, the rest of us were just standing around watching the TV screens. This place is super lame and I won't ever be back."", ""The worst... Food was cold and tasteless.  We thought we were eating week old leftovers.  When this place closes, I hope the guys from Zaynas will take it over so we can have a good place to go in this part of town."", ""There is nothing like the other pics showed!!! I never give out review on Yelp, but I had to comment on this restaurant! I am a sushi lover, the fish was poorly cut and the sushi rice is tasteless.

The Eldorado website clearly stated that they served lunch and dinner until close. I was very unimpressed. We did not even have a chance to try their beer as we had been driving for 5 hours and needed food first."", ""I was thrilled when my favorite eyebrow threading place opened this location in Wesley Chapel. I see Ina every 2 or 3 weeks, and I am very pleased with her work. She is not as speedy as some of the others, but that is because she takes time to make sure she has done a thorough job."", ""I was just there last night. Awesome Italian restaurant. You are welcomed by the owner when you walk in who is very friendly and wants to ensure you are enjoying the meal and service. I can tell that the customer is extremely important to her and it shows as there is a decent wait, but it is worth it. This is my go to place for Italian food. Prices are reasonable and the plates plentiful. I typically get penne vodka with chicken. Their penne vodka sauce is second to none. What separates them from others is the apps are great, filling and just as much detail goes in the creation as their main dishes. Combine all this with BYOB and you can't go wrong. I never have room for dessert, maybe one day. If you want a consistent, reliable Italian restaurant this is it."", ""Poor service to start off with. Server was abrupt and seemed to be kind of snippy I guess you could say. Waited 25 minutes for food and when it arrived it was luke warm at best.

Despite the great rating, I was still a little nervous to try out cheap seafood. But I learned 2 things from this place:  1. It's not cheap; it's AFFORDABLE--extremely affordable.  2. In addition to their amazing and fresh produce, my favorite part about Ippolito's is the menu. SUCH a great variety of delicious seafood;  *The shrimp roll is amazing. A toasty brioche bun filled--and I mean FILLED, they don't joke around--with delicious fresh shrimp that POP in your mouth with every bite.  The salmon burger is off the hook, too + the best of Philly (their famous crab cake sandwich).  And the people that work here are super nice, too. Ask them about each menu and they give you a detailed rundown of what it is and how it's prepared.   I go here almost every day for lunch now--it's healthy, incredibly delicious, and oh, did I mention it's ridiculously affordable?"", ""Couldn't ask for better off of bourbon street. We were waited on by the owner and she was wonderful. She explained the history of the drinks names and about the band. The drinks are petite but pack a huge punch( &10 a drink).

Their cold brew coffee is strong and unique and their coffee that they market all over the tampa bay area is on the stronger side but for an experienced coffee drinker there's nothing better.

We settled on the jerk chicken, collared greens, cabbage and rice. The profile picture must be the small platter because we got the large and the food was piled so high the lid could barely close! The second platter was for the kids: fried chicken, mac and cheese, fries and candied yams (that she threw in for free). Everything was delicious and more food than we could possibly eat.

We (5 girls celebrating our 30th birthdays) agreed that we had to do some sort of swamp tour while we were in NOLA in April.  We booked online and drove ourselves the 35 minutes to Slidell (for a few bucks more, you can get shuttled there).  We showed up right at our tour time, so we were worried that we wouldn't have enough time to check in, use the restroom, and get to the boat before it left.  Thankfully for us, Canjun Encounters offered a \""\""late\""\"" boat for us tardy folks, which left 15 minutes after our scheduled tour time.  Whew.  Our guide, Captain Troy, was fantastic.  He took us quickly up the river, stopping occasionally to give us some interesting factoids about the area.  Then, we quietly floated into the swamp.  It's gorgeous!  And Captain Troy continued to give us more great info about the swamp and its inhabitants.  Due to the unseasonably cold weather, we didn't see any alligators up close.  However, we did get to pass around someone's pet baby alligator.  Too cool!  And we got to see someother wildlife, like birds, turtles, snakes, and spiders.  I guess my only complaint is that we used a covered boat, which hindered our view of the swamp a little bit.  Other than that, our swamp experience with Cajun Encounters was fantastic.  Highly recommended!  *Tip: go to Southside Cafe for lunch.  It's only a few miles away, and the food was AMAZING."", ""Huge mall didn't get to see it all but what I did see was awesome.

At about 8pm 15 very young people walked in and had an even longer wait for her to even acknowledge there presence. I was guessing for Karaoke which doesn't start till 9pm. I left at 8:30pm. I have no idea how they stay in business and certainly don't know how she makes any money. Clearly the owner is not interested in making this a place to go. I went to the Old Double D many many years ago and I bet the original owner is glad he's gone-he should have never let them keep the name."", ""The drinks and service are pretty good here, but the security they have is aggressive and poorly trained.  I was spending the evening at the bar having a great time with my girlfriend and the other patrons. I was there for several hours and decided it was time to leave. As I walked out three security guards approached me and starting harassing me. They told me to leave (which I was on my free will already)... I questioned why they were harassing me and they threw me on the ground, improperly handcuffed me (which is illegal),screamed at me, called me a \""\""fat mother f'er\""\"" \""\""Bitch\""\"" \""\""that's what you get\""\"" among other obscenities, and proceeded to call the pinellas county sheriffs department. All this happened on a public sidewalk 20 yards away from the business. They left bruises and marks all over my body, injured my knee to the point I'm limping, ripped my shirt, and broke my glasses. They made up a story that I tried to hit a bartender (mind you I tipped 25% and was having a good night. Plus I'm not even a violent person). The police showed up shortly after all this... I was illegally detained and released after they concluded I did nothing wrong...I was trespassed verbally from the property due to this and asked to leave. If I truly assaulted someone like the security claimed I did I would have been arrested. They're aggressive and had no right to assault me.   I called after this all happened and asked to speak to the owner to try and comprehend what happened. Brooke answered the phone. I asked her why I was assaulted and I asked for the video of what happened. She responded with \""\""you've been trespassed and get a subpoena if you want the video\""\"". She hung up on me afterwards. I called back and at that point she told me she'll get me arrested for harassment if I call again... They know they're wrong. Just be careful going here...

Penca is a small restaurant and I knew we would not be able to walk in and get a table, hence the reservation. We showed up and we were told it would be a while, a group was seated at our table.  We waited, and waited.  I had some disagreeable word with the hostess.  We waited some more.  We got two stories - one was none at all just \""\""sorry\""\"", the other was the group came in claimed the table and told the staff they were friends of the owner and they'd cause trouble if removed from the table.  Doesn't matter to me because if the latter is true the owner needs new friends since the current ones will put them out of business, and if the former is just ineptness on the part of staff they'll be out of business.   And so we waited some more.  Given the timing leaving for anything but Subway was not an option. We got seated about 35 minutes late. They comp'd us two drinks for eight people for the wait. I will give a shout out to our server who did a great job of trying to put this train wreck back on the tracks. He did a very good job."", ""This was my second visit here, and it was much worse than the first. This restaurant is extremely small, and if there aren't any seats, you are welcome to stand in the back by the bar without seating, in the way of all the commotion. We stood by the bar for about ten minutes before we were asked if we needed something. We wanted to eat, but not standing up. We saw multiple tables open up, and had to ask if we could sit there, even though we were the only people waiting. We finally sat, and a young,brunette waitress came and took our order. We wanted two orders of the Short Rib fries appetizer, since we would be having it as our dinner opposed to sharing it, and she looked at us like we asked her to bring the whole cow to our table. She asked us if we were sure that we wanted two, and we confirmed that we did. The first order came out in about 5 minutes which was amazing. 10 minutes went by, then 15, and our server didn't even come over to see how our first dish was, just stood in the corner chatting. We got another servers attention after 20 minutes of waiting and let him know we were still waiting on our order. We also advised him that if it wasn't ready, to forget about it and we would share the first one. He came back and told us that it would be out any second. Another ten minutes went by, still no dish, still nothing from our original server. We let the young man know that we were no longer interested in the dish that was 25 minutes late, and then our original server finally decided to come over! Could you believe the first thing she said was \""\""so im hearing that you never got the second batch of fries?\""\"". As if it was some kind of rumor. Then had the nerve to ask if we still wanted it. She took it off the bill but I was extremely disappointed with the service, and will certainly not return the next time I am in town. Especially since I got sick in the middle of the night from it. Village Whiskey, please train your staff how to serve properly, and give them some lessons on customer service."", ""All I have to say is that Epcot's Mexico had better tacos than this authentic Mexican joint.  And that's pretty disappointing.  The meat was mildly warm and wasn't seasoned well enough. The beans and rice were bland as well. They were out of steak, so we mistakenly tried pork skin.

I did the usual paperwork, had to pay up front, which had I been able to pay afterwards. I probably would have left and gone to Lankenau. So, the MA who came in and asked me questions was cool, personable.... My blood pressure was insanely high, which I have never experienced before (168 over 135) and I got panicky, as the alarms and crap were dinging,... The MA definitely recognized my concern, and listened pretty well.  The Dr came in and I went  thru my list of symptoms and he totally blew me off, I  said even the fact my blood pressure was sky high wasn't a bit alarming,....He said no, I have anxiety. Made me out to be a hypochondriac, which totally isn't the case, I've fallen off rooftops and walked junk off like the queen of england. He then asks are you tired...Yeah I'm tired , I work full time in a hospital and waitress part time, and I walk like a million miles a day, but I feel crappy now more so than usual.   He palpates my belly and asks a few more questions, then says well I think you may have mono.... But there isn't much we can do about that.... I asked if he could run an epstien barr heterophile blood test to see...He said it wasn't neccesary. Um....Ok. \""\""Tthere isnt much that we can do about that anyway\""\""... Great. He says I strained my wrist. I'll get you an ace bandage....Well what about the mono possibility....ande the fact my blood pressure was insanely high....Once again he gives me this look like listen you dirty little tattooed hood rat...you have no idea what your talking about..... \""\""Your a perfectly healthy twenty seven year old. Your fine. You have anxiety problems, you checked off depression on your chart.....\""\"" Um. Ok. So I then wait half an hour for an ace bandage while the chick runs around bitching how they don't have any supplies, never can get anything done....(reassuring) I mean, to be fair, I probably could have gotten a better physical at my apartment considering I have a broken wheelchair,a blood pressure cuff, a buncha vacutainers, some cough syrup, and part of a trach tool kit (don't ask me and my brother work in healthcare,....and kinda hoard stuff...) So I finally get my ace bandage and ask the girl if she can take my blood pressure...SHe says she can't find a stethescope. I ask a dr passing by if he can and he pretty much laughs in my face. \""\""Aren't you leaving?\""\""  Um, ok. \""\""why do you want your blood pressure checked?\""\"" \""\""Because it was insanely high when I came in on the machine, and I was hoping a manual read would prove different\""\"" So, in less than good humor, he pretends like he's checking my pressure (I know how to use a blood pressure cuff, he didn't set it on the right numbers or place the stethescope in the correct area....) He says  \""\""It's like 110 over 90. Why, do you feel ok?\""\"" Whatta mess. For the record, my brother and boyfriend took my pressure, it's still high, and now I'm out 70 bucks and all I got was a steam punk piece of junk arm brace that I'll probably be wearing in a casket judging by these reviews."", ""Haven't been to a Philllip's in a long, long time. So when work took me to the Sheraton in Philly I thought it was time to reacquaint myself with my childhood seafood place... Bad idea.  The crab cakes I remembered as delicious morsels of ambrosia turned out to be overly greasy, too little crab, and much too little taste. At least they were edible. The grilled snapper (fish of the day) and asparagus that I got on the side were overcooked and drowned in butter as if this could hide the unmistakable blandness of the food.  I was quite literally crushed. Hoping this is was symptomatic of the location and not the chain.

I also asked her to clip down my nails and they are extremely crooked and none of them are the same shape. Instead of asking me if I wanted square or rounded nails, she just clipped of the corners and now I am missing corners on different nails. Her customer service and paint/shaping skills were TERRIBLE!

Other customers in your salon had an unhappy look on their face. I will not be returning to your salon and you have lost a customer over her very poor work.

Meaning it was no longer an incentive for me to return my car, it was a personal favor I should be thankful for.  THEN on my quote print out.. there re-appears the $1,300! They snuck it back in my price thinking I would not notice and tried to cover up with some story about taking it out of my \""\""discount\""\"" (but I followed what they were saying, and it indeed was a deception)  SOUTPOINT: No such thing as \""\""90 day period\""\"".. I was leasing another VW, therefore they did not even care to inspect my car. I hand it in as is (assuming I had my 4 doors and bumper of course!).  --------- RAY BRANDT: I wanted the black Tiguan and I had to pay $200 transportation cost to get it from another dealer  SOUTHPOINT: No only did they pick up the black Tiguan from another dealer 100 miles away, they drove it all the way from Baton Rouge to my WORK! NO CHARGE! --------- RAY BRANDT: Expected I pay 70% of the MSRP in 36 months. WHAT?!?! and they had no explanation (except for jargon) when I asked three times for the break down and how that makes sense to THEM.   SOUTHPOINT: Paying 35% MSRP in 36 Months. BEFORE negotiation -------  RAY BRANDT: Any and all incentives (that I knew about beforehand) were now personal favors. Told me the price break-down print out was something they \""\""don't show people\""\""!  Ok, only every other dealership I visited before showed me the print out WITHOUT that fancy line. I give my social, birthday, salary, credit history, and address... I think I more than deserve to know the details of my future car!   SOUTHPOINT: Gave max incentives, honored all deals online, adjusted discount to make whatever I put down still in ratio with other deals for down-payment promos that I wasnt participating in, wrote off $$ on contract based on negotiated prices we had talked about. Gave me all information and price details upfront.  ---------  RAY BRANDT: Jacked the MSRP price $1,200 more than market price claiming when the car comes from Germany it's a bit lower but once it gets to dealership they add things such as \""\""felt trunk separator\""\"" and the \""\""first aid kit\""\"" that factors the price higher. AGAIN... WHAT?!! hah!  SOUTHPOINT: MSRP was $4,000 lower than RAY BRANDT  (SAME EXACT CAR). Mind you- it's not actually \""\""lower\""\"".. this IS the price of the car.  -------  RAY BRANDT: $467/month $1,000 down for basic factory standard Tiguan S 2016 (please look up so you can laugh that I could lease an AUDI for that much).   SOUTHPOINT: $256/month $0 down. SAME TIGUAN S 2016!!  -------  RAY BRANDT: Only saw me as easy $$$ and an ignorant consumer  SOUTHPOINT:  Respected me AND my wallet. They did EVERYTHING to make my experience as convenient as possible, honestly and ethically.   --------  Even if Ray Brandt dealership gave me a deal I couldn't resist, I still wouldn't be able to sign the contract because I don't trust them."", ""Casinos are just lame.

If we would have went anywhere else, they would have apologized for the mistake which we all would have understood, it happens. Then asked us if we needed anything and immediately replaced what was missing and on top of that added some more. Now that's customer service. For what they did, we will not becoming back ever again.

The peppers & onions weren't fully cooked, the hash browns were like mush and it was smothered in plain old pace salsa from a jar. Sick. And so, so disappointing. Also incredibly over priced at $10 for a breakfast meal. We had 2 adult and 1 child meals, and used a free meal coupon and the bill still managed to be over $20?!

I was asked and ordered orange juice, only to have to ask a different server 10 minutes later.  This happened multiple times with different members of our group.  Then another table must have requested tabasco sauce, which we had on our table.  The server comes over between two of our members and takes it, there was no \""\""Are you using this?\""\"" or even \""\""Excuse Me.\""\""  They need to find a different way to motivate the staff because it did not meet basic service expectations.

In order to get a buy back price, I had to talk to a salesman and go for a test ride of a car that I did not want.

Every time I said I was not interested, the salesman would disappear for a few minutes and then come back with another offer or even another salesman to try and convince me to buy the car.

I spent ten minutes picking red pepper flakes out of the soup and my mouth.      I also tried the chicken satay.  The chicken was ice cold and as dry as beef jerky.

We were escorted upstairs to the bar & restaurant where we were told they were out of food menus and they would give us one when it came available...so that's when the waiting game began.

The layout of this place is rectangular and very long so if you don't get there early and man your spot, good looking getting a glimpse at the stage. They cram over 1000 people in this small club and if it wasn't for the TV screens people would have missed the show entirely. I feel horrible for about 70% of the people that came to watch the show, there is really no good seat in the house. Also their security is absolutely horrible, they were constantly rushing through the crowds to stop people from smoking or taking pictures. When they weren't shoving you to get through they were shining a flashlight in your eyes. We also had security shove us out of the way so he could stand in front of us and take video himself of the band that was playing. They are so unprofessional and rude. If you plan on going to see a show here, I wouldn't recommend it especially if there's going to be a lot of people and a sold-out show because chances are you won't see anything.

Food was delicious, ingredients were fresh, service was friendly and fast, price was just right for the quality of the food and service."", ""We came to eat last night with a pretty large party (9 people).  Being in a large party in a busy restaurant, you expect things to take a bit longer than normal. We were fine with that, given that this place came highly recommended.  We were seated within about 30 minutes, which was not bad given how busy they are. After sitting there for about 25 minutes, we had yet to be approached by a waiter. We let the hostess know and she sent a waiter over to us. He said that he would bring us all waters and be right back.   Around this time, another large party was seated at the table next to us. They appeared to have 7 people, which was confirmed when the waiter brought our waters to their table and mysteriously ended up with 2 extra glasses... A minute or two after that, a different waiter showed up and apologized, saying there was a mixup with the table assignments.  We figured that it'd be a good idea to go ahead and order while we actually had somebody's attention and placed our appetizer, food and drink orders and asked for waters. That waiter was never seen or heard from again, though... 20 more waterless minutes passed (45 minutes in total by this point) and we were tired of waiting..  To add insult to injury, though, the other large table that I mentioned had their drinks and appetizers delivered just then.  One person from our party approached the manager to complain and was basically just told, \""\""we're busy\""\"". Yes, restaurants get busy and food may take a while, but 45 minutes and not even water? Needless to say, we just left and enjoyed a very good meal at Coop's Place a few blocks down.  It's not often that I feel compelled to leave a review, but this is definitely one of those occasions. It's funny how many reviews over the past year or two echo the exact same problems we experienced last night. You would expect management to take corrective actions, but I suppose they don't care as long as butts are still being put in seats."", ""Once again you arent coming here for anything but the food. It is a place most people will look at and drive by.  However it is another hidden gem of epic proportions. They have a different way of making their food with a slight charred taste that is noticeable if you are any sort of regular at eating asian food.  I recommend the shanghai noodles, the flat noodle and beef with black bean, shredded pork crunchy noodle, and a dumpling soup similar to a wonton soup.   This is another place that you will not regret if you try it. They really shine at the fried noodle dishes, so try keep it close to that if possible. Also try milk tea if you never have before."", ""They've yet to get even my most basic of orders right (iced black coffee), and when I do order specialty coffees, they suck. I ask for extra espresso every time and even though they'll charge me for it, they rarely add it. Specialty Lattes? They'll taste like mostly milk. Service is also mediocre. They will give me the correct drink if I drive back, but who wants to have to drive back every time? Not to mention it comes with a side of attitude.   Whoever is running this place, please get it together."", ""Just had lunch with family here today. Awful service. First, steaks were not cooked as we had asked. Second, they ran out of our sides and instead of asking us before they brought the food out if we would like to substitute or wait for it to come out with our meal. They just brought out our meal and said it'd be 15 minutes for the rest. Asked for manager, manager trivialized our concern. Tried to explain their communication process as if it wasn't their fault. When I told her that this should have been communicated to us first, she gave up and stated flatly what we wanted her to do. I don't know? Why don't you tell me what you're going to do. Don't expect your customer to handle your problem. As a manager, take initiative and fix the problem. After that, we had a free appetizer on our phone. Waitress took phone instead of writing it down. (Seriously people, this is a liability on your end if the phone breaks or there is privacy issues.) And failed to use it. So charged another person the appetizer in an attempt to hide the fact. Seriously, stay away from this one. Usually have a good time at other Texas Roadhouses. Never going back to this one."", ""As usual, Spiro's provided an excellent meal. I had the 16 oz prime rib, perfectly cooked medium rare with a stuffed baked potato and a squash medly, and wife got the gyro salad (not on the menu--just ask for it).

While we don't really drink much, the couple next to us, in their 70s and dressed formally, had before - dinner shots, wine throughout appetizers,  entree', and desert, and followed it up with a shot of sambuka (sp.?) afterward).

I think the most ringing summary is that I have since moved ~1 mile further away from the Khyber, and I still go there just as often.  I have now sampled most of the menu, but the truly excellent Southern barbecue is what usually calls to me.  You can't go wrong whether you pick the brisket, the ribs, the chicken, the pulled pork or a combo of the above.  Their mac and cheese remains my favorite side, and the addition of the very good coleslaw rounds out the experience.  I love the vibe of Kyber.  It usually pretty full, but they usually seem to have a table available for me (Yay!).  It is often loud, but never quite so loud that I wish it were quieter.

The music is amazing, the setting is intimate, and by intimate I mean very close quarters.  You may have to stand or sit on the floor(on cushions) but you will be very close to the band.  I sat on the floor, on cushions, probably less that five feet away from the band. It was amazing, I could hear the members of the band chat and was just about as close to the music as I could be.  The quality was very, very high; the band played traditional jazz tunes.  Important to know about Preservation Hall, is that they are all about the music. They don't have restrooms, don't serve any alcohol or food, and you have already read my comments about the physical set up of the venue. But the music is phenomenal and makes sitting on floor, waiting in line, and no water or alcohol worth it.    My wife and I got in line about 7:30 on weekday evening in late May and the line was already down the street so plan ahead.  They have an 8:15, 9:15, and 10:15 most nights of the week.

It is an inviting restaurant upon arrival, really cool place to look around in as your waiting for a pick up or a seat. The cashier was very welcoming and asked me if it was my first visit. After yes he offered samples of anything on the menu and recommended the most popular dishes. I was informed that almost all the dishes were similar to a stew or soup served over rice. My order was the drunk chicken with a vegetarian option for only 7.50! I was very surprised with the affordability of a full plate. Since I ordered to go I received my food in a simple styrofoam clam shell container. The presentation was pretty lackluster, but food doesn't need a fancy container or complicated presentation to be delicious, that's exactly what this was! This was some of the best food I've stumbled upon in Indianapolis. The drunken chicken was so flavorful with just just a tad of spice. Vegetables were sweet and tender, for vegetarians is a terrific option. Great size portions for the price.

So my tooth started hurting really bad & I made an appointment. Went in & the dentist turned me away with an excruciating hurting tooth just bcuz I missed an appointment a few months before.

I will never go back & I will not recommend this dentist to anyone."", ""They did a nice job renovating the place, but the service is awful. Worst of all, the pancakes were terrible - chewy and flavorless. Last time I'll come here."", ""I have eaten here several times during the four years I have lived in Philly, and have had happy hours or cocktail events here as well, as an employee of a company in the building; and I have had wonderful experiences. This is thanks completely to the *servers, bartenders, and kitchen staff*. On Valentine's Day, however, we had a very different experience. I am confident that the servers and kitchen staff were amazing as always, but we never found out. We made our reservation about a month and a half early, to ensure a window seat. OpenTable asked for a credit card when booking--no problem; we provided it. Upon arrival, we were told that, since we did not place a deposit, there was not a table for us. Yes, they could see our reservation in the system, they said; they can see the date on which we placed the reservation, a month and a half prior. However, they claim to have called us (one time) to get a deposit from us, and since they were unsuccessful, they didn't hold us a table (again, they can see our reservation, they knew we were coming).  **No one had ever called to obtain a deposit from us.**  Further, had they needed a deposit, that should have been worked out between OpenTable and R2L--not our problem. OpenTable asked for a credit card and we provided one. Plus, how incredibly rude is it to require a deposit for a table reservation anyway? As a semi-regular at this place I find that greatly offensive. We weren't speaking with hourly-waged youngsters either; we started with a manager and were escalated to \""\""one of the owners\""\"". Neither woman made an attempt to be friendly, let alone apologetic or accommodating in any way.  This lady who was \""\""one of the owners\""\"" should definitely keep herself exclusively in the back of the house, away from any sort of paying customer.  I have never, as a customer, been treated so poorly or talked to so terribly. And, no, I can assure you, we were not out of line or yelling or making a scene or rude for our part; we just aren't the type. She was plain awful.  Never so much as a shred of an inkling of a hint of an apology or any effort whatsoever.  So, despite all of the rave verbal reviews I have given everyone I know about this place in the past, I will now make sure that everyone we know, meet, work with, or do business with--several of whom work in that building--does not ever drink or dine at R2L.  And, clearly, we will never step foot into the place again either. After leaving, we had an amazing meal with mind-blowing service at DEVON SEAFOOD.

When I got home, knowing nothing about this vehicle, I did some research. It is classified as a sub compact. So Enterprise took my full payment for a full sized vehicle and completely screwed me. I don't have time to go back to the rental office, so I am stuck paying full price for a sub compact, and I have to use this vehicle for a 1400 mile trip. Never again will I use this rental agency. Don't be like me, do better research and be prepared when they try to screw you over!"", ""STAY AWAY from this place unless you want to possibly be hit by a \""\""drunk gambler \""\""coming from there.

I'm definitely gonna stay away from that part of town after 4ish as that's when the \""\""heavy hitters\""\"" come in to support the greasy, dirty, place that really only cares about their gamblers.  The kitchen has some kinda mold issues that literally smells like a sewer plant.  The 2 gals that have made a career outta this dump rely on the drunkards to tip them \""\""big\""\"" if they win on the slots.  This is a very sad version of any kinda chicken joint or sports bar.  The greed that the owners share is obvious as flat screens are cheap these days and these guys can't even loosen their hands on the \""\""gambling profit\""\"" to invest in to this dump.   Is sad as the original owners did a great job and these new guys don't care about anything except the profit from the slot machines, including the nasty food they serve.  The bartenders are high-strung and anything but friendly, unless of course, you are gambling big and they have a chance at a big tip.

He had  the Bouillabaisse which was also delicious. We were too full for dessert but the ones we saw being carried to other tables looked amazing! Our server was very attentive but not overbearing.

The kitchen has some kinda mold issues that literally smells like a sewer plant.  The 2 gals that have made a career outta this dump rely on the drunkards to tip them \""\""big\""\"" if they win on the slots.  This is a very sad version of any kinda chicken joint or sports bar.  The greed that the owners share is obvious as flat screens are cheap these days and these guys can't even loosen their hands on the \""\""gambling profit\""\"" to invest in to this dump.   Is sad as the original owners did a great job and these new guys don't care about anything except the profit from the slot machines, including the nasty food they serve.  The bartenders are high-strung and anything but friendly, unless of course, you are gambling big and they have a chance at a big tip.

Having met the owner in the past and having his wife wait on me I knew something wasn't right. I explained to the waitress that this dish had changed and wasn't good! She politely offered something else. What to order...if they had modified a basic dish what was next?

I said this is not what they had served me for the past 5 years and I never had requested a special order before.  I also asked what they had done to the phenominal soft tacos? They were usually served in a soft warm flour tortilla and had moisture and flavor. Tonight they were stale and crisp and the filing was bland.  Again he informed me I was mistaken while he held my order that had been sent back to the kitchen in front of me. I apologized and said I didn't wish for anything else, thank you. Another manager came out a few moments later apologizing and stated that they are unfamiliar with what I had ordered and would \""\""special order\""\"" anything I wanted. I declined.

They kept my truck for over a month- sold me used parts and charged me as if they were new parts. Charged my bank card unauthorized charges and to top it off, after paying over $7,800.00 my truck still wasn't working. I finally took it to the Ford dealer where they documented everything that was wrong with my truck and even confirmed that the wrong type of USED turbo was put on my truck. The manager Ray at the time was also just on channel 13 news because he was arrested for doing this to other customers. Seems like Midas transferred him to another location after too many complaints.

After an hour we started asking about our lunches; at one point the servers said that our order was about 1/2 prepared.  Wait. What?  An hour+ for three sandwiches?  They said they were slammed.  We could see three open tables outside and two other tables seated after us had already received food.  Lots of \""\""I'm sorries\""\"" from the wait staff.  We insisted on a complimentary round of drinks (which they did agree to).  When the food finally came, the Roast Pork sandwich and fries were completely cold (guess that was the half that was done on time).  The pork was fine, but the roll just average and the gravy was awful.  Fries, meh.  Cheese Steak filling looked like ground beef and was a miniscule portion in a large grinder roll.

Our server, Ashley, was not interested in providing any semblance of customer service...RUDE! We had a simple question about the beers on special and she became quite defensive. My daughter spilled her drink, which I realize is a pain in the ass for the restaurant and server (although we were outside so it wasn't that big a deal). We apologized profusely but she didn't even try to hide her annoyance. Finally, the chicken quesadilla should have been labeled the gristle quesadilla....more fat than actual meat...yuck.

This breakfast is not worth spending the extra money in booking this hotel. The shuttle service left us at bush gardens new years eve because they claim we didn't make reservations to and from because there shuttle bus could only hold 8 people. We went to the front desk and watched them put our name and room number on the schedule and they still were able to screw that up. I had to call the hotel at 12:20 a.m. 01--1-2015 and spoke with one of the managers about our situation being stranded after making reservations and she wasn't even apologetic. She told me to get a cab and the hotel would reimburse me. I explained to her there were no cabs in sight and she claimed there was nothing she could do. We had to walk to the hotel 1/2 mile away on new years, thanks hyatt..  Our bathroom was so small you couldn't even close the door without having to step into the shower. Also at 3:30 a.m. there is a very loud train that comes through and blows a very loud horn that alarmed everyone we spoke with staying at the hotel. After this experience we will Never book anything with hyatt because it was very disappointing after spending $400 for 2 nights to receive this kind of service...

It's hot as hell outside, wasps everywhere and we're standing here. I asked about other clean rooms and he (a-hole manager) (neil Patel) sarcastically states check in is at 2. It's 1:45 though. If you're going to check guest in at least make sure the rooms are clean or let them know it will be a few. So I'm standing outside in the heat as they apparently clean the room.

So, when we had guests in town, we decided to drive a bit and take them to Bottleworks on a nice fall day to enjoy a few drinks before dinner at our place. What in the heck happened to this place? Saturday afternoon, the patio was about 2/3 full, but we got a 30-45 minute wait for 15 people including a few babes. On top of that, we were told we had to order food if we sat on the patio. Fine, we will order a few appetizers. Nope, it had to be entrees. After promising to make it up to the server and tip well, we were given a pager. Waited 45 minutes to be seated as we watched tables sit empty. Once seated, some of our group ordered entrees because the server made them feel bad, so that made the meal I already had prepared completely worthless. The topper was when we got our checks, the server told us we were not as bad as she expected and to come back again when we got babysitters for the babies. So is there some new trend in hospitality to treat your guests like this that should make them want more?  I do hold a special place in my heart for this place as we used to walk there with our kids all the time and even hit up their markets and other events, but I was so embarrassed for talking this place up the way I did and actually driving more than a mile to go here.

Party buses fit 14-15 people, 14 comfortably. The bus is adorable & mad cute with big open windows with lights surrounded to grab spectators attention ;) Nice black couch with nice audio to play your jams. The downfalls to the bus is there is not enough places to put your alcohol or snacks or additional coolers. There are cup holders in between seats but if your bus is  full, you won't be able to use them. There also is not place to hold on to while the bus is in motion over head so you'll have to have good balance lol.  Besides that, Top shelf offers literally the best deal in town!

Thank God Luke was connected to our hotel!!!  We ended up eating here 3 times over 5 days.  It's usually full of business suits, but that doesn't bother me when the food is so good.  All the traditional dishes were good, but the huge surprise was the burger.  I was against ordering a burger while I was in New Orleans, because I wanted to try as many local eats as possible... and you can find burgers anywhere.  I overheard this lady raving about how delicious her burger was, so I had to order it the next time we ate there.  She was absolutely right!  It was one of the best burgers I've ever had!  It was huge, juicy, and packed with flavor.  I also highly recommend getting their bread pudding a la mode.

While the staff is very accommodating, you're better off skipping this restaurant.  I worked in a very large well known Cajun/creole restaurant and what we were served was very bland and poorly prepared.  Red beans were definitely from a can. I didn't taste any of the distinct flavors of red beans n rice.  There was no ham hock flavor, no bay leaf flavor or discernible mirepoix flavor.  The collard greens tasted like they had been boiled without any additional seasoning and served, poorly drained. I couldn't eat it.  The jambalaya was also very odd, most definitely from some prepackaged mix.  The jambalaya barely had any meat in it and was definitely not close to anything like jambalaya. They aught to be ashamed of calling that Jambalaya. It was more like frozen mixed vegetable rice pilaf, seriously. Jambalaya \""\""jambon a la aya\""\"" the jambon (ham) is the core of the dish, seriously. Wtf.  If the management is reading this: revise your recipes and quality check often. It's a downward spiral when you sacrifice quality.  One of us who are the crawfish etouffe had terrible food poisoning.  I think there are issues with storage, food rotation, labeling and training.

No matter the time of day, it seems to get pretty rowdy and my friends and I have had drinks spilled on us on multiple occasions. Almost every time I have been here with my fianc\u00e9 or friends, it has taken an abnormally long time to get service whether it be inside, outside at a table or bar. The food is mediocre for the price and a few times the food took MUCH longer to come out than what we were told, and when asking management what was going on, we were told that the estimate was wrong and it was \""\""too bad\""\"". Staff is rude and far from attentive, though it seems like this place is always over-staffed when we have been here. Amazes me that management allows such a huge lack in customer service.

When they first switched over the new owner would offer you champagne or wine and made promises of what else was to come. For example They offered your own tools to you if you were a frequent client , and punch cards for rewards. However , I watched the quality of this place go right down the drain. The service became slow and less accommodating. There's no way I could get out of there in under an hour mostly due to the inexpirienced techs who I felt were winging it.

The downstairs lobby was overrun with beer swiggin' Bubbas playing country music and beer pong.  Although we paid for a non smoking 2 bedroom suite, it is clear that our room is not NON-Smoking.  There is no NON-Smoking sign anywhere to be seen, and every other room on our hallway is a smoking room.  To add insult, the front desk tried to argue that hotels are not required to have NON-Smoking signs designating whether the room is or isn't non-smoking.  This is the equivalent of seating a family in the middle of a smoking section in a restaurant, and then claiming that your table is  \""\""NON Smoking\""\""...

I am not the type to complain, but I have been here twice and both times I have had terrible service at the bar. The first bartender served me but acted as if I was bothering him.  This second time, with a completely different bartender mind you, it was worse. I am not dressed like a street person or anything, and I am not pan-handling. But you would think that I was the way he acted. First, I sit at the bar and I am waiting for service. So, the bartender walks by me, pours a glass a water, turns in front of me, puts the water down, gives me some stupid half-grin then walks off. Not one audible word of greeting or a grunt passed between his lips. Then, he gets a menu, drops that down and walks off again! Not a sound. Is it me, but when a customer enters an eating establishment, shouldn't they be greeted in some manner?  Not looked at like \""\""why are you here. I have better things to do\""\""?  I am not looking for a royal salute or anything. Just \""\""Hey man, what can I get ya?\""\""  or something to that affect.   Anyway, I start to look at the drink and food menus. Then, a group of anywhere from 10-15 people come in behind me and say, to what looked like a manager, \""\""We don't want to eat, is it ok if we just have a few drinks at the bar?\""\"". The manager says \""\""Sure.\""\"" The guy then says, \""\""Can we get few beers down here\""\""? (paraphrasing). The bartender says \""\""Sure!\""\"" and proceed to service this group, one-by-one, as they order drinks. Ok, fine technically, I was looking at the menu when this started. But still, he walked back and forth, right in front of me, for about 10-12 minutes. Not once did he say, \""\""Hey, just shout and I will get you something\""\"", or \""\""Hey man, just give me a few minutes and I will be right with you\""\"". Nothing!  It was obvious it was a big group, but I mean, he gave no acknowledgement to the fact that I was sitting there waiting!   Long story short - after this 10-12 minutes of waiting, I just walked out and went somewhere else. Now this place has about 4\\5 stars with around 500 reviews. So, I guess people like it. But their bartenders are as unfriendly as I have ever encountered.  Maybe if you get a table it's different."", ""this place SUCKS. Terrible service and overpriced mediocre food.

You're always offered a free upgrade, too, with a cut (massage, paraffin wax hand treatment, etc.) while they wash your hair. They also offer complimentary beverages and snacks, too. Both Amanda and Britta have cut and colored my hair, and I highly recommend both!  This is not a place to be rushed - if you just want to get in, cut your hair, and get out, I don't recommend this salon. They truly understand the definition of what a salon is supposed to be: a place for relaxation and pampering. Allow at least 90 minutes for your cut, but I usually make an afternoon out of it.  Be sure to make your reservation at least 1 week in advance - they get very busy and walk-ins are probably not a good idea (given that they spend a good amount of time on each client, as I mentioned above).

And esp families, stay clear!  So first off, I decided to take my 15 month old son out on a sushi date. We arrive at the Sake House at 4pm. There is only one other table and they were closing out. We sit down, and I immediately ask for a simple ice water with lemon. Waiter comes back 20 minutes later (no water). I order a simple roll for my son, to get him started  and a cold Sake. I said I will wait to order mine to get him settled. Another 30 min later, still no water, no food. Waiter comes back with hot Sake, instead of cold. 20 minutes later, the roll for my son (not how I asked) finally some cold Sake, then I have to request water, and then only one cup for my son, no lemon. When I see 2 going on a third table had come in and ordered, and a \""\""to go\""\"" order is being placed, all with food and water, I became perturbed. The waiter never came back to see what I wanted. Never came back to check on the order. Finally after  nearly 2 hours of waiting and trying to deal with my antsy son, who waited so long to be served, and seeing one chef trying to make everyone's order I decided it was time to go. Finally after waiting another 5/10 minutes I had to walk up and ask for my check , which was only a $6 drink. Which I reluctantly paid. After being in the hospitality industry for years, I know what to expect, and I know what to forgive.

Inside is very cozy, clean, and nicely decorated.  The staff is always friendly and attentive, and the food is pretttty good. Their duck fries are amazzzzing and the portion is huge! I can never finish an order with my girlfriend and it sucks that it doesn't taste half as good when heated up later. The burger here is really big and unique, but I feel that the meat blend can be a bit better as it seems a bit tough. The brunch menu here is a lot cooler than the normally offered lunch menu (the duck fries are still offered!), and would much rather come for when they are offering brunch."", ""Probably my least favorite thing I did in New Orleans. It was a boring boat tour with a guide that had the strangest accent. It felt like he was slurring through the entire two hour tour. Not very interesting insights either and it was so freaking hot on the boat I was just trying not to pass out from the heat and humidity. They stuff these boats to the brim and it's a total tourist trap. The water is brown and there is little to see. Much better off doing a swamp tour so you can at least see alligators and birds.  The one positive is they don't charge an arm and a leg for cold drinks which are an absolute must on this tour if you must go. So many other fun things to enjoy, I'd skip this one if I were you."", ""Service wasn't good, wait time wasn't bad but it seemed like our food had been just sitting up in the window because it was so cold.

Sad thing is that it used to be so good. :("", ""Dined at the restaurant for the first time tonight.  The food was excellent.  The kitchen is most accommodating.  I ordered the roasted pear salad which was listed on the menu as being served with gorgonzola cheese and a red wine vinegrette.  I asked if they could substitute goat cheese and the apricot vinaigrette which was served on another salad - NO PROBLEM,  Osso Bucco is my favorite veal dish and Trattoria Totaro's is one of the best I have ever had. It was served with risotto and broccoli rate - both excellent. My friend loved her Veal Vivian.  Portions are very generous and the food is served piping hot and plated well. The lemon cake we shared for dessert was delicious - very light and refreshing.  Our server Donna could not have been nicer.  Will certainly return very soon."", ""Horrible!  I called to order an item and to insure I would be able to receive it the next day, which I agreed to pay for overnight shipping.

We had just been in a large group who dropped $$$$ on drinks, snacks at the sister restaurant Tinto next door too. Rude!"", ""Went in with a friend for a bite to eat before doing some bar hopping. For some reason the menu to me seemed somewhat limited but I might be alone on that. It's not pricey but for the type of food they serve I feel like it's slightly over priced and in my opinion that food wasn't out of this world. It was average at best. We tipped our waitress 15% and she was slightly rude to us on the way out. Overall not a fan...there's much better places out there to spend your money."", ""Best sushi in Tampa bay!

This isn't a good thing.  It's almost impressive how bad the check-out is. You can find the shortest line, where there is one or no people in front of you, and it will STILL take you like 20 minutes to get through the line. The last time I went, my nail polish rang up as $82 for some weird fucking reason (probably because their computer system is from like 1983) and then the girl had to do the whole thing over again. The penultimate time I was here, I managed to get in a very short line only to have the lady in front of me decide to sign up for a Sears credit card (REALLY WHO DOES THIS SHIT) at the check-out. Which took an impressively long amount of time. Will I still come here to buy my hair dye? Sadly, yes, because it's like half the price of the grocery store. And lord help me if my natural hair color starts growing in.  Also, I seriously almost run someone over every time I try to park.

I highly recommend the huevo rancho and best sandwich.  The grits was very good as well.   If you decide to visit this restaurant, say hi to the owner.

The customer service is worse each time I go back. The woman who works there is incredibly slow and the younger man is slow & rude. I'm not sure why making a sandwich for me is such a burden for someone who works in a sandwich store. But maybe it's because I'm interrupting his chainsmoking.  This morning the man decided that he should take his time to finish preparing his coffee before he got around to making my sandwich. And apparently he isn't clear on the fact that you should wash your hands before you prepare food- gloves or not!

She was doing great until Thursday, when we noticed her getting a little slow and not wanting to eat.  We decided friday when we both got home from work, to take her in.  This place was the closest and recommend by our vet clinic for emergency service.  They wanted to do a series of test and x-rays.  I was fine with the blood work but really wasn't excited about dosing our poor little girl with radiation for the x-rays.  The Vet told me it was necessary.  So we sucked up the $650 charge and had the work done.    At this time the Vet said there was not an elevated white cell count and that the dog was not dehydrated.  I asked about maybe a course of nursing friendly antibiotics. The vet recommended that we do immediate surgery to extract her uterus.  We did plan on having the dog spayed but this was a big shock.  The poor little dog just had puppies, was nursing and now they wanted to fillet her open! WTF?! How could they possibly think this was a good idea.  Not only that, it was getting a little annoying how every time they recommended something, they would step out and come back with a piece of paper stating they wanted your next paycheck up front.  So we declined the $3,000 emergency surgery, paid our $650 bill and left with a course of antibiotics.  Our little dog is doing just fine.  She had a mild infection but kicked it. Glad we have enough education and experience to have made the most conservative and preservative decision of our dog.    And I won't even get into the story about when we saw the $3000 estimate for surgery and the Vet said that if it was not affordable, some people do choose to euthanize.  I grew up on a ranch, I work emergency medicine, and understand the circle of life, but this place just plain baffled me.  It seemed more like a place that wanted to ring you dry for cash rather than try to help you make the right decision for you and your animal.  We told our regular vet about our experience and she was even pretty taken back about the price of everything.   Will we not return."", ""My husband and are new to Dtown and love Thai food.

The employ told me to leave my name and number and the manager would text me pictures of dresses with the prices that night. I never received a text or phone call from them. So about a week and a half later I called and asked them what was going on. The lady who answered the phone said she would leave a message and they would again call me back that night and get everything figured out.

The restaurant was completely empty.  We inquired if they were even open and a nice lady said they were and proceeded to seat us.   Their menu did not offer as many options of meat types or dishes as most Mexican restaurants do here in Indianapolis.  My husband ordered a margarita and the special of the day, Chilaquilles con salsa verde y pollo at $6.99 and I ordered a carne asada burrito at $7.99 and water to drink. Chips and salsa were brought to the table.  Chips were  fried there, and while I like that style of chip (thin, often bubbles into thin layers) but were cold and very greasy.  Salsa was sweet but had some heat in the finish.  It was easy to eat a lot of those! When our meals came to the table, frankly, they were underwhelming.  My burrito tortilla looked/felt like it was not heated at all and cutting into my burrito was disappointing.  There was lots of lettuce and tomato, a scoop of a white rice (not spanish rice) and there was supposed to be mozzarella cheese in it but couldn't taste or see it.  The carne asada was thinner than a strip of bacon.  Unfortunately, I would be generous in saying there was maybe 2 ounces of beef.  In all honesty, there was no more meat in it than two strips of bacon, diced.  My husband mentioned it to the person (owner) with a quick \""\""sorry\""\"" muttered and no offer to do anything.   While the combination of ingredients was not improperly prepared, there are 100 other Mexican restaurants in town I can spend $8.00 on a burrito and it would be generously filled with meat. As for my husband's chilaquilles, I order this all the time from Biscuits in Broad Ripple and this was another disappointment.  This was chips, salsa verde, one fried egg and a very thin boneless piece of grilled chicken.  My husband felt as I did.  Not poorly prepared but completely lacking any substance.  During the time we spent in this restaurant, there was not one other customer coming or going.  With the lack of substance to the food, I suspect most people will feel as I did and would not waste their time coming back here.  There is no way this restaurant can survive when prices are the same as other Mexican restaurants but quality is far less.  Sadly, I was even mad that we spent $25.00 at this place and left just to drive to a fast food restaurant so we could get some quick, cheap protein.   I will chalk this up to a learning experience.  Folks, save your money and go to Rosita's or Margaritas U.S. 31, Leonardo's or even El Meson."", ""I have now been here 2 times, and both have been strictly out of necessity. The prices accurately reflect the overstaffed, up to date facility, while their service does not.   While every time that you have to take your car in anywhere, you cringe at what they are going to come and tell you, this place has been far and away the worst I've experienced. I do not trust them in the slightest. If you're looking for tires, they may be ok, but the mechanic services are horrendous."", ""My son got a pho and thought it was ok.

Never going back"", ""I ordered delivery, food was an hour ad a half late and cold when it arrived. I was told they would be sending a free drink and dessert due to the tardiness, but those items never arrived. When I called to inquire, they said they would remake my order - though since it had been two hours since I originally ordered, I was not surprised nor did I care when that never arrived either. Food, service and punctuality were all terrible. I recommend spending your money elsewhere - this was the worst dining experience I've ever endured."", ""Hmmm let's just say avoid this cheesecake factory! Upon arrival they said it was going to 40 minutes for our table. That's perfectly fine it is a rainy night and I expected it to be a little wait. We walked around the mall and did a little shopping before they texted us to let me know our table was ready. When we came to check in the hostess informed us that our table was given away to a larger party but they were working on getting our table together now. Strike one! Don't text me to tell me my table's ready and then give my table away when I check in. I asked to speak to the manager and he also informed me that they made a decision to pull the table that were going to sit at to get the table ready for a party, but they would have a booth cleaned off soon.... That should have been my clue that it was going to be a sucky experience when the manager cosigns with a silly mistake.  They finally got our table pulled together for us and we had a very friendly server from what it seemed. We ordered and waited and waited and waited. (Ok we will say it was because it is a busy night) Our food finally comes out and my Chicken Farfalle was supposed to have extra Farfalle sauce on the side. No Farfalle sauce. My friend ordered the steak Diane and shrimp scampi. Her steak Diane was supposed to be MW however it came out medium closer to medium rare. We informed our server that the steak was not cooked properly and I was still waiting on my Farfalle sauce. The server informed me that she \""\""just had not picked up the sauce yet and she would get it\""\"". Strike 2. She brought me back my Farfalle sauce and let's just say it wasn't Farfalle more like Alfredo sauce. When I told the server it was Alfredo she took it sniffed the bowl and said ohhh let me fix that. She came back literally with the same bowl she sniffed and said \""\""this is the correct sauce the manager said it's the correct sauce\""\"". I told her it was incorrect and I have eaten this many times. She proceeded to try and explain how it was the correct sauce. Strike 3! I am done. I know what this sauce taste like and that was not right.   I will not be back here and please whatever you do just go to the one in Green Hills! The Green Hills Cheesecake Factory service is always good and the food is always great. I've tried this one about 4 times and it always ends up the same.

You can drink while the TV is turned down so you can't hear it, while there is no music on and while they ignore you and talk amongst themselves behind the bar. Rude!! The glasses/beakers that the drinks were served in were neat, but there was barely anything in there to drink at all, and for nearly $10!!! Don't get me started on the food and how when your ordering they make you think the side comes with it by asking, \""\""What's your side?\""\"" only to be given your bill to see that sides are extra.

When I was 17, I had to exchange a sweater I got for Christmas.  I was looking at the sale table and found one I liked, but it was missing a price tag.  I found another example, but it was also lacking a price.  So I got a salesman and he found four of the same sweaters, all missing a price tag.  Another salesman starts looking on another table.  Still no dice.  They've been looking for fifteen minutes and apparently the one knew how much it cost, but didn't want to tell me in case he was wrong.  They finally call a supervisor and he or she approves the one salesman's price without really knowing if its right.  Its about 50% more than the other sweaters on the table and way out of the price range for most 17 year olds, including mine.  I wasn't expecting to spend that much, but it was nice and how can service get more amazing?  Two salesmen spent twenty minutes of their time two days after Christmas to help an averagely dressed kid find a sweater he probably wouldn't have purchased.  That's five stars to me."", ""Sister restaurant to famous St. Elmo's, Harry and Izzy's shines in a light all by itself.  I can't say how impressed I was by my meal here.

But in comparing this tattoo shop to the others around Indy and how they've jacked me around i decided its simply worth it to give 5. The other places have cancelled on me at the last moment, even when i was en route to go get the tattoo, one guy didnt even remember me when i called the day before to make sure we were on schedule for the tat and yet another had the inks set out and asked me to sit down when he got a call that he needed to go pick up the kids at school - all of these places i scheduled months out in advance as well. So, here we are back at Metamorphosis where they actually like to run a business the way it should be. Honestly i have only had one tat done here by Trevor and at the time it was the most fun 4 hour rib tattoo experience i could have had. They act professional, not like the rock star wanna be's i tried to check out at other places. Just cool chill people who want your business here. Trevor gave me the tattoo i wanted in the place i wanted it even though i feel he would have given me honest advice if it were needed. When it came time to get the tat, he held his appointment and i was treated with respect and as though a customer should be treated. Honestly i dont think this place cost more than any other place where youll get good work. Prices are about average in my opinion for the quality of work done. Dont waste your time going to the other places and getting jerked around - ive already done the work for you. Its a shame too that they may have good artwork at other places but youll feel like less of a human going anywhere else. The artists are just as good here and youll be respected for your $.  And by the way, yes they do ask for a non refundable deposit so they know your serious which is no different than any tattoo place ive ever been to. Hopefully they dont change up anything, especially their roster as i believe they have a good thing going here. Yes its in hoity toity popular town but its a diamond in the rough and there are no rock star attitudes here.

They rotate their flavors regularly and if at first you don't see a topping you'd like be sure and ask if they have it because they keep some under the counter!

The gardens and deck are so inviting and the restaurant nestled on a beautifully landscaped and expansive property right next to a (roaring at the time) creek.  Food - Amazing!  Having lived in Hawaii, traveled all over and other countries, the sushi was FRESH, creative and flavorful without being chaotic or overwhelming.  So often, sushi chefs lose the delicate balance between spectacular flavors, simplicity and maintaining the fish as the star!  They get it right here!  Among our group, we tasted just about everything on the  menu and from the Sashime to the Korean beef dishes and all the sushi rolls in between, everything was a wonderfully flavored, balanced and beautiful!

I had everything that a guest would want from a large clean room with a flat screen TV with lots of channels to a pool and fitness center. The room we got was huge and had a couch in it, a mini fridge, great a/c (a must in FL. when it's hot), a coffee maker with coffee, and a complimentary breakfast. The breakfast consisted of bread, bagels, mini muffins and danishes, fruit, juice, fresh bananas, apples, and oranges, coffee, tea, various cereals, oatmeal, and milk. They serve breakfast until 9:30.   They also have free wi-fi and the place is within walking distance to CVS and a few restaurants and a deli. If you don't have a car to get around and are stuck there, you don't have to walk far to get something if you'd rather not order room service or if you happened to forget to bring something like deodorant.   Also, the staff is nice and friendly. The room service menu has limited options, but I won't knock them down any stars for that. The price for our room was booked through a hotel site, I can't recall which one, but we got this huge luxurious room for only $89.00-:D I also loved the fact that I had the pool all to myself most of the time which was a big surprise to me.

A large bowl of pho, a bbq pork sammy to-go (for later in the afternoon), a Vietnamese coffee with boba.  Man- o  man.... the best. I have made this a lunch staple about 50 times over.  The only time I have been a little disappointed is when they ran out of basil for the pho.   They also need to make sure their bathroom is a little cleaner.

I love this place, because I love super unhealthy really large, flavorful burgers that clog my arteries like there's no tomorrow.  The menu is simple, burger, cheeseburger, double burger or cheeseburger, add bacon or dont add bacon.  Thats about it.  Pick your toppings, add fries or cajun fries, and you're good to go.    I always get the bacon double cheeseburger because lets be honest, as soon as i set foot in the door the healthy aspect goes out the window so why not get the worst item for you on the menu.  The cajun fries are the best and they come in HUGE portions.  All the burgers are handmade and you get to choose as many toppings as youd like for no extra charge.  Definitely an A+ in my book."", ""This is my husband's favorite brunch place. It's hard to get him to go anywhere else! Their yogurt parfait is the absolute best in the city.

Some brunch places give you nonsensical portions, and I always feel bad, because I feel like I'm wasting food. Ants Pants gives you very reasonable portions.

For technically being in a food court in the Farmers Marker, Arnold Myint sure did step it up. He has created a casual, yet upscale counter restaurant in a food court. Bravo!   I ordered half of a turkey sandwich and a side of the chick pea and feta salad. Everything was extremely fresh, which I would hope for being in the farmers market. If you choose to eat at their counter, which we did, you get a real place setting, not a recycled paper box. Its like you are eating at a nice restaurant, but paying the same price you would pay at come crappy fast-food joint.   The service was great. They kept asking us if we were enjoying our meals, they even gave us a taste of their Mexican Chocolate & Coconut brownie. Which by the way, was delicious.   I could be considered a geek by some, because of how fascinated I am with new innovate technology, so needless to say I was more than excited when the waiter sat an iPad in front of me. The screen showed a breakdown of all the food we ordered and you just swipe your card to pay. Then they text/email your receipt to you. How cool is that?  So, for a fresh delicious meal under ten bucks, head down to the Farmers Market and check out am@fm."", ""Had lunch here for my birthday on October 7th and was not disappointed.  It was definitely one of the go to restaurants on this small pier and we really didn't have to wait that long to be seated. There was seating both outside and inside, but we decided to sit indoors since it was a bit windy and hot outside since we were literally in the ocean on the pier.  My boyfriend got us the shrimp cocktail salad and the 4lb (maybe it was 6lbs lolz) crab to share that was the special of the day. But out waiter had informed us that they ran out of the specific crab we wanted, but gave us two different crabs that was equivalent to the weight of the crab that we missed out on.  Once our food arrived, we dug right in. Everything tasted, so delicious and fresh. We finished off everything that we ordered and made sure not to leave any sort of crab meat morsel behind. The shrimp salad was surprisingly good. It was light and the shrimps were juicy. The crabs had their own different flavors and came with really crispy onion rings on the side and melted butter.

You need to book a tour with these people & you need to bring a few cans of bug spray.   The tour was great! We started off strolling around and hearing information about the waters, animals and plants in the area. The tour guide was very informative on how Katrina changed the area as well. The first hour was uneventful and we couldn't seem to find any gators. I'll be honest - I'm not a hard to please person and just strolling around the swamp looking at nature was great for me. We were able to find gators at the last hour of our tour. Smaller and medium sized! I think it's awesome that the guides lure in the gators by throwing marshmallows and waving hotdogs on a stick. It makes it fun for the kids to watch, too.   There was one part of the tour in which our guide had a gator on one side of the boat and a boar on the other. He made the effort to throw feed on the land for the boar to get out of the water. I love that Cajun Encounters isn't just showing customers the animals in the swamp but the company is truly protecting the animals.  The end of our tour the gnats came out. We would move away and they would follow. I didn't realize that they bite but the next day we were covered in bites and itching like crazy. We went through four tubes of itch cream and one itch spray. Our tour was on the 8th and it's now the 16th, some bites are still there. Just be smart ( unlike me! ) and use bug spray... lots of it.   Over all, I loved this tour! Seeing gators was fun. A boar jumped right up onto the boat where I was sitting - so fun!

Well my faith has been revived by Handle Bar!  Even though the coupon is what brought me to Handle Bar in the first place, I would gladly return and pay full price...exactly what those coupons businesses should do.  Handle Bar is quite spacious with a large bar along the back side of the place, a pool table right when you walk in, and various tables to sit at along either side of the bar. It has a very homey feel to it, which was reinforced when one of the bartender/waitress's son came in and played with his toys on the bar while visiting with his Mom.  We ordered off the Russian side of their menu, which is a must!!! We got a cup of their soup of the day, pork dumplings, and crepes filled with breakfast food. The soup was broth-based with lots of meat & veggies. It was served alongside sour cream and a spicy sauce, so you could customize it according to your preferred tastes. I added a little bit of both and ended up with one tasty soup! It was hearty, yet still somewhat light thanks to the broth. The soup started us off on the right food and our main dishes kept that going. The pork dumplings were cooked just right and were served in a super flavorful broth (it was a vegetable stock of sorts with lots of dill), it was also topped with sour cream to make for a richer flavor. The crepe was also delicious; I really couldn't choose which one was better! The crepe was pretty fluffy and stuffed with scrambled eggs and a few veggies, then topped with crumbled bacon and sour cream.  The staff here was also great.

Their service is also great, but they do get rushes and there could possibly be a wait depending on when you go to dine in. The good thing about this place though, is you can order to go!

There is no way I, or anyone for that matter, would have found this place if it weren't for someone just like you doing a review. Thanks guys!  Tucked away in a strip shopping center, albeit a cute shopping center, is this little non descript  restaurant. Since it was early in the day, we really weren't worried about a reservation although I did call as a just in case measure.  We wanted to sit outside since the back looks so pretty but were told it was closed but were led instead to an enclosed patio. Still nice.   Nicer still was when our server brought us bread, olive oil and a plate of marinated cannelloni beans with yellow and green squash. Wow! The squash were just a tad bland and needed salt but the beans were really flavorful.  My husband ordered the squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta and mozzarella cheese and I the beef carpaccio. Although I did miss capers on the beef and there was too much salad, both the dishes were really good.  Now, our server gave us the list of specials and mentioned that two of them were served with langostines. I had seen these on one of the cooking shows but didn't know exactly what they were. My husband ordered the Carbonarra and I got the Langostines with a blush sauce served with lump crab and fresh tomato.  My dish was pricey, yes it was but incredibly worth it. Imagine a cross between a lobster, a shrimp and butter. Really. The langostines simply melt in your mouth leaving happiness behind. The carbonarra with panchetta instead of bacon my husband ordered is the best I've ever ordered or even tried to make.   As I've said, we were really early so we got to watch the prep of the restaurant between the the lunch and the dinner service. It was truly a privilege. These servers went through the place with precision, dusting, wiping, washing and primping every aspect of the restaurant.   If you go, and you should, bring a nice bottle of wine, order the langostines and the tiramisu. Enjoy!"", ""I simply love this place, best breakfast in New Orleans by far ...... Ok so I must say more for this to be a review!! I had banana foster French toast to die for, the shrimp and grits are perfect. Not over season with Really creamy grits & a Fresh carrot& apple juice cold and refreshing omelet with ham cheese and avocado AMAZING!!!! Diet starts soon"", ""Ordered food at noon. Waited 55 minutes for two salads. Friend ordered House Salad, when it arrived it was spring mix, red onions, cucumbers. No cheese, bacon, tomatoes, pecans. When questioned, response was \""\""the chef changed it.\""\"" Without asking the customer?? And to what....the only items we have prepped? Asked for the manager but was told she was in the kitchen.  Guess that sums it up. Obviously will never go back.  One day later UPDATE: A marketing team member reached out to apologize and offered complementary meal as his personal guests should we want to try again. Hope this is indicative of a team trying to right the ship. Stay tuned."", ""Authentic Greek taverna in the heart of Philly Fairmount neighborhood.  This family owned restaurant features a fantastic selection of tasty Greek food. Whether for a salad, a Gyro or and entree you can't go wrong with this classic local favorite."", ""Very fresh food- they actually make their own stuff! We ate lunch at the bar and the bartender went out of his way to help my husband find a good gluten free option.   I ordered the black bean burger and it was delicious! Great atmosphere as well. Definitely recommend this place as there are not all that many fresh and relatively healthy places in the area. Wish we had found it sooner!"", ""We dropped by 21st Amendment for some late-night cocktails in French Quarter without going to the rowdier spots. Given that this was close to where we were staying (the Marriott), it was easy to pop out and roll over to 21st Amendment, which was only a few minutes away. There wasn't a line outside, but it was packed by the time we made it inside (sometime between 10-11 PM)...standing-room only, with the seats at the high-top tables and the bar taken. The decor and ambiance is a bit more retro, but like all New Orleans spots in this fashion, it feels homey, and it was enhanced by the fact that the band in the bar playing live music was absolutely entrancing the audience, with some folks even doing some dancing right at the front.  That said, I did come here initially because it was rated highly for drinks, and on that front, the cocktails do not disappoint. The bartenders make the drinks expertly, whether you stay on-menu or stray off by giving some general preferences. The beer selection is more generic, with specific bottles being the big-label brands, and no names given for listings like 'seasonal' or 'IPA'. Nonetheless, the drinks are made quickly but consistently - something I appreciated given how busy it was that night. Pricing was reasonable, relatively speaking - $13 a cocktail is a bit expensive, but the quality was very good, making it a bargain compared to some places in New York that I have been to.  21st Amendment really has a nice cozy feel to it, and with great drinks and great music, it's hard to go wrong. It doesn't have the kind of 'fun' you'd find half a block over on Bourbon Street, but at my age, it's the kind of fun that I'd rather have. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area."", ""I have visited this establishment over the years and can only say it continues a downward slide to depths of mediocrity I thought unattainable for a business to remain open.  I stopped in again today solely because the usual Saturday performer was not playing. His replacement was a welcome change from the overly affected ridiculous twang rendition of every song played by the usual performer.  Equally welcome was the absence of his asinine and drunken \""\""roadie\""\"" riding his non existent coat tails and harassing the staff. Laughably billed as an Idol and Voice contestant who has yet to make it past round one of local auditions.  As for Kelly Days; beyond disappointing! If someone can explain the economics behind a 12 oz draft of costing 4.25 and a 16 oz can of the same brand  costing only 3.25 I will nominate you for the Nobel Prize in economics.   Not sure why the previous manager, Jay, left but I wish him the best. The current staff and management falls just short of oblivious which combined with their unique brand of indifference and incompetence leaves one wondering how the doors stay open. Did I try the food? Heavens no! Not making that mistake again or the aforementioned ever again!"", ""If I could give this subway 0 stars, I would. The only reason I'm not overcome with guilt of misleading people with the extra star is because once in a while, once you suffer through the ordering experience, the food is somewhat tasty. Sometimes.   I am surprised to see more reviewers didn't comment specifically on the chain smoking, smug, openly mocking rude sandwich maker that seems to always be the only employee. A few did, but not all.   This man COMPLETELY ruins the subway experience. He laughs at you the whole time you order, moves so slow, doesn't respond when spoken to, and gives the most disturbing looks. I do not understand how he keeps his job, unless he's also the owner, and in that case I don't understand how he runs the business.  Go to the wawa up the street if you need a fresh hoagie."", ""We were here in Philly for the night and decided to go here on a whim.  So glad we did!!!  The food was delicious.  The dining area was really quite loud. But the food was quite wonderful.  We ordered chicken lo mein and the beef garlic stir fry.  My husband and I liked the lo mein better, but both were delicious.  We are sure you'll like this as much as we did!"", ""Once again you arent coming here for anything but the food. It is a place most people will look at and drive by.  However it is another hidden gem of epic proportions. They have a different way of making their food with a slight charred taste that is noticeable if you are any sort of regular at eating asian food.  I recommend the shanghai noodles, the flat noodle and beef with black bean, shredded pork crunchy noodle, and a dumpling soup similar to a wonton soup.   This is another place that you will not regret if you try it. They really shine at the fried noodle dishes, so try keep it close to that if possible. Also try milk tea if you never have before."", ""What a cool place.  Great locally roasted coffee, fresh and delicious baked goods, cat products made by local artisans, and, CATS!

Our server, Grant, was a rockstar and so helpful and patient with us. Definitely recommend. Great burgers, beer, and staff!"", ""This is not my neighbourhood liquor store, and I didn't just stumble in one day. I on purpose sought out Sherbrooke after it came recommended so many times by friends and acquaintances.  The beer selection at Sherbrooke is seriously unmatched by anywhere I've been in the city (or in Calgary, where I used to live, actually). I love the way the shelves are organized, and how full they are! Whether I am searching for something annoyingly specific, or just kind of want to pick up a bunch of new single pints to try, Sherbrooke is always always the first place I think to look. This is also now a destination of sorts when friends and family are visiting. GONE are the days where we spend our days at popular Edmonton attractions. Now it's pho down the street, then beer shopping at Sherbrooke, sorry Mom. I have also been told that they label their vegan wines, though I am much more of a craft beer girl myself so haven't really perused."", ""LOVE this place! Fresh, hot, delicious pizza and breadsticks. The decor and atmosphere is great, it's a nice clean establishment with great service. I accidentally left one of my favorite jackets hanging on my chair tonight and walked all the way back to my car when I turned around to see our server, Joseph, running after me with my jacket in hand. He was able to track me down almost all the way to Bankers Life Fieldhouse! What a guy :) Thank you Joseph, we will definitely be back."", ""This was a great place to stay.

Long story short, nothing is even good at this place. Everything is bland tasting.  We got the caprese salad (had to ask for extra balsamic since is was such a small drizzle on top.). My husbands pizza was so plain, the crust tasted stale and there was NO FLAVOR at all. My pasta dish was tolerable but needed tons of salt just to taste ok. Again NO flavor. Oh I had to ask for them to bring salt and pepper to the table btw?? The food took too long considering it was not crowded. This place is a waste of time and money.

The burger was decently seasoned and had perfect melted cheese on top. The onion jam on top provided the perfect sweet to the burger's salt. The sweet potato fries are skinny fries and are the prettiest, brightest shade of orange I've ever seen! They had a nice texture and good seasoning.   Now, the filet mignon was incredible! It had one of the most amazing textures I've ever experienced in a steak. It also had a very strong pepper flavor that was perfect!

When we got back for dinner the champagne, strawberries, and candles we all set up perfectly! My girlfriend was very surprised. Then they helped me schedule a couples massage that evening, which was another surprise. So the first afternoon / evening there was absolutely perfect.  The vibe of this inn is very boutique, quaint, and charming. Perfect for couples. We could also use the bikes daily (for free), which we did.

I don't know if the gravy was spoiled or what the problem was.  Immediately when the plate was place in front of me I almost gagged from the smell.  It almost smelt like old garbage.  It is impossible to describe but on a hangover stomach it took all I had not to go running for the restroom.  Now, I didn't want to be rude so I decided to give it a go, maybe it was something else causing the smell.  It most definitely wasn't.  It tasted rancid and completely inedible.  My roommate, who is a human garbage disposal took a bite and immediately spit it out.  He couldn't even stomach it.  After 30 minutes of sitting in an empty diner with a plate of food that was hardly touched NO ONE came over to ask if there was any kind of problem.  Someone slapped a bill down in front of us when it looked like my roommate was finished eating and that was that.  My roommate had to push the plate across the counter because the smell was so terrible as he was trying to eat his own meal.  I am not a picky eater and there is no way that was how it was supposed to taste.  Later at home I ended up vomiting for the rest of the day.  I will not be back."", ""So disappointed, I'm so embarrassed! This is a $50 mixed bouquet! Trader Joe's makes better arrangement! Mostly green filler with a couple mum, iris and Gerber daisy."", ""This place is gross.  The bathroom was dirty, with peeling paint and rusting fixtures.  Old AC unit made horrible noises every time it shut off.  The previous guests left some sort of food in the microwave, indicating that it had not been cleaned.  The rates were low, but the Howard Johnson or Motel 6 next door couldn't possibly be worse.  Not worth it, go somewhere else."", ""All things get better with time!  I have come here off an on since they started the business.    If your new - sampler for 2 - 2nd option best way to get a variety and taste the food.    If slow they have a great coffee ceremony. TEA is very tasty too!  Honey wine is good too but I have not had it at this location.  If your looking to share or take some home I suggest these tasty additions:   KITFO - a sirloin ground typically eaten rare but you can (and I do) ask for it med or med well.   SHIRO - num num num  All the meat dishes are fantastic in my experience so if your looking at another meat option explore, they do meat well at this place!    I order sample for two plus all the sided dishes listed for 4 people - we ate most of it.    Caution to those who are not spicy food fans - to me this place is VERY tame in the spicy department but I have heard others who cannot handle a mouth full of flamey goodness to exclaim, this is a little spicy."", ""My husband and I went here on a Friday evening. A woman cut right in front of us as we walked up to the hostess stand and got her party of four promptly seated. We then walked up to the hostess. They had six tables open as well as people finishing their meals at several other tables. Yet they insisted they could only seat us outside (it was a torrential downpour with thunder and lightning) or at the sushi bar. When we asked about how long it would be to wait for a table they first said about 30 minutes which we agreed to (despite there being 6 open tables) yet then a moment later the manager came over and said it was not possible to wait for a table.  While I can not comment on the quality of food I can say their service is absolutely horrendous. I can not fathom why it was impossible to seat us at a table despite the 6 open tables or allow us to wait for one yet we could sit out in the storm or at the bar. I will not be returning here."", ""Stopped here for dinner on the last night of a week long work trip. Best meal of the week! The chips are hot and crispy and perfect for salsa, guacamole, and queso. They keep bringing out the chips till the dip bowls are empty. We had tacos, and they were all delicious. But wait, there's more! Do yourself a favor and get some street corn. It's get-outta-town good! The list of drafts is short but top notch. The staff is super friendly and happy to make recommendations, despite being super busy. Looking forward to my next trip to Nashville to visit Nectar again!"", ""BEWARE!  ZERO STARS! Do not buy here! Only received part of my order.  I called to advise them that I did not receive all of my products. The small box had 8 of the 9 items, and a blow dryer would not fit. They told me to send a picture of the invoice they sent me, and they would respond by email.  72 hours later I received an email that they confirmed that all items were shipped and they could not assist me.  I called a second time and the lady told me to call the Post Office for further assistance and that the post office is responsible for my lost item.  I asked how many boxes were shipped, and she replied \""\""one\""\"".  I informed her again that the box I received had the small items in it and could not hold a blow dryer.  She said there was nothing she could do.  They reviewed a video and it showed the items being packed. I was placed on hold several times. She told me to take a picture of the package box used to ship the items and email it.  I sent the pictures of the box with a Capri Sun package beside of it to show that a boxed blow dryer would not fit in the box.  Have not heard anything several days later.  Very frustrating!! Horrible customer service and very offensive. They accused me and the post office of stealing items."", ""Just left this awesome place & can't say enough about the helpfulness & fun the staff is.

When I was explaining that Im concerned things are too burned, the owner lady walked up and snatched the plate away from me without saying anything. I did not know if they ate bringing another one or not. Only after I grabbed my waiter later he said they are not making another one ans would take it off my check.

I've been here mmmmm about ten times. Well not this exact location, but nevertheless to Blaze Pizza. Tonight's occasion was Friday pizza night with the kids. What made it even more fantastic was the buy one get one free coupon I retrieved from Facebook. I ended up seeing a friend here who also had the coupon. Before I ordered our food I made sure to ask the cashier, Amanda, if it was buy one get one free for all pizzas or per order. She stated for all pizzas. I went ahead and ordered and added my friends order to ours, just to be nice. Once it was time to check out, the same cashier then said no, you can only have one per order. I purposely ordered four pizzas based one what she told me. I was of course puzzled and frustrated. She then turned to who she called the \""\""general manager\""\"" and said I can only do one right and he said yes without even looking into what was going on. I tried to get his attention but he ignored me. He was a little busy I will add but when something is happening, tend to it. I told her ma'am I only did it this way because of what you told me but of course she acted oblivious. Totally upset me but I decided to just leave with the bill we were given. I was really upset not because of what happened but because of how it was handled. Rudely and unprofessional!"", ""Great food, the service is excellent.

There were four groups of other people ahead of them. The young guy who calls people in lied to our faces when I asked why they were seated before the one that had been waiting for awhile. I physically saw them pull up in there vehicle and walk up. So I know for a fact they were not here before us.

The Italian wedding cookies was a little crunchy yet still delicate, it also had the perfect amount of Anise flavor. The dark chocolate florentine is so yummy, that says a lot because I don't like coconut. The chocolate to coconut ratio is perfect.

Come along with me, as I journey back in time -- all the way back to Wednesday...  I step foot in this 7 Eleven, and the first thing I think is: this is one of the nicest looking 7 Elevens I've ever seen. It is very clean, bright, and spacious. Very nice looking selection of prepared meals. There were many that actually looked like they'd be quite good. But I wasn't hungry this day. No. All I needed were a few items.   First, some good old TP. And let me be perfectly clear (as clear as Barack Obama): I DON'T buy the cheapest toilet paper because I'm cheap. I buy it because I like the way the cheap stuff feels. The more like sandpaper, the better. I like to feel like its working. I don't need to or even want to feel like an angel is up there. Or some perverted freak named Scott.   In any case, I got myself 4 rolls. And then I just needed one more thing - some plastic cups for a little party I'm having this weekend.

I begin laughing. I tell him the price is clearly wrong. He tells me he's got to talk to his manager. Meanwhile, I tell the folks behind me waiting in line that I'm just going to go run and get different plastic cups to hurry the process along. Before he got back from doing his price check, I already had another cashier ringing up my two sleeves of cups for 1.99 each. That's more like it.  At around that same moment, the first cashier comes back from his consultation with his manager. He tells me that the price was, in fact, incorrect. And that the price is actually 14.99.  THAT'S the unscrupulous part.  CLEARLY, THAT price is also far too high. His manager did no actual price check at all. He simply told the cashier to pretend that the real price was actually 5 dollars less, thinking that I'd be stupid enough to accept this. Why, because I'm white, and you're a racially superior Indian? You think white people are stupid don't you? We'll just believe what you tell us, and fork over our money."", ""AMAZING!

Our server was a young girl and I believe she was training someone so we got extra special attention, which was nice! The salad was fresh and served on frozen plates along with their fresh garlic bread. The crab legs came out fresh and hot and were served with mashed potatoes and an ear of corn. My only complaint is that after the initial order, they only bring out one crab claw at a time when you order more. This was a little disappointing since we were ordering all you can eat and definitely came to eat more than one at a time. The server was accommodating though and let us know that she would put in a new order each time she delivered our new plate so we never had to wait, which was nice. You can tell they don't mass cook the crab legs because they come out hot and steaming each time. The manager came over to check on us twice and ask how our experience was.

One wall it is covered with useful cabinetry to include a kitchenette. The kitchenette has a full-size refrigerator, large microwave and a dishwasher. Leave your dishes and utensils at home because they have everything. It would be very helpful to you to bring paper towels, disinfecting wipes,  dish soap and trash bags. They do not provide  housekeeping services on the weekends unless requested. They do provide housekeeping services every fifth day regardless if you're fifth day falls on a weekend.   The place also sports a nice size indoor pool that ranges from 3 feet to 5 feet in depth. Instead of the traditional chlorine pool it is Celine. They also provide towels in the pool area. Just outside of the pool area they have an outside patio with propane grills accessible to all guest. So bring your hamburgers and hotdogs and plan on grilling out.  Staff are exceptional. Not only were the front desk staff friendly but staff in the breakfast area and housekeeping were extremely friendly.   The hotel is situated in an area St. Louis referred to as the growth.

I visited my sister in LA and she sprung on the great surprise that we were headin' to Santa Barbara for the weekend.    The Shellfish Company sits on the end of the Stern's Warf which is one of the longest deep-water pier between Los Angeles and San Francisco.  From the outside you can see the tanks of fresh Abalone, Dungeness Crab, and the infamous Spider Crab.  You must make a reservation here and be prepared to wait a bit.  The inside is a classic, you are here for the food not the ambiance,  tavern style seafood bar with outside seating (be careful it can get windy). My sister and I sat at the bar.  The bar and overall inside seating is pretty tightly compacted which may bother some.   We, however, were in seafood heaven and talked it up with the staff/bartenders who were really awesome; enjoying life kinda people - they tipped it to the official 5 star review.   We started with the Abalone for an appetizer which was really good; perfectly seasoned and cooked. I also had to try the chowder - awesome, but Maine's is better!   They have a decent array of beers on tap and I chose a local brew.  For dinner we split the Spider Crab cause we ain't scared of shh... ok, maybe I was a little....it was huge!!!  The dinner combo, I believe, came with choice of soup or salad.  Splitting the crab was definitely enough for two people. I recall my sister throwing in the towel and me testing my manhood.  My one critique is that I thought the Spider Crab was over cooked.  It by no means ruined the meal and may not be noticed by most but I know my seafood.   Overall one of the best experiences ever.

The dips were really special hummus style and change - we had beet (beautiful color, nice earthy taste), sardine (a bit fishy for my taste, but the rest of my party devoured it) and a third veggie one (my favorite).   I had the smoked cod with basmati rice and boiled egg. Though it isn't a traditional brunch meal, it was a great meal with good flavors and the right portions.   My mom went with the featured Cyprus breakfast and what looked like hash browns is actually a greek styled cheese, very delish. I would recommend this dish for those looking for brunch fare.   Their almond milk drink is mmm, yum, very thick and sweet - great for breakfast add-on.   Our waitress was fine, but the host/owner (?) was really welcoming and helpful along the way to bump up my rating."", ""Anyone who says that this restaurant is \""\""shockingly average\""\"" does not know anything about fine dining.  I have eaten in famous restaurants all over the world, and this one is right up there with any of them.  I will admit that if you are looking for a \""\""scene\""\"" or a \""\""trendy atmosphere\""\"", this restaurant is not for you.  However, having said that, I will say that there is no other restaurant in Philadelphia that produces food that is as interesting, fresh, and delicious as Marc Vetri's.  The service is impeccable, the menu ever-changing, and the preparations fascinatingly nuanced.  I went there tonight for my tenth time.  I took a few friends out for a celebratory dinner.  We ate their famous charcuterie plate, a special preparation of nantucket bay scallops, pig's foot ravioli, pork belly papardelle, spinach gnocci, shoulder of baby goat, salt-cured branzino, a cheese plate, lavender gelato, and chocolate souffle.  We ordered \""\""family style\""\"" and enjoyed every single bite.  In fact, we ordered \""\""seconds\""\"" of the papardelle and scallops because they were so delicious.  Some advice before dining at this restaurant.  First, eat family style.  It is the best way to taste as much as possible of the diverse menu.  Second, let them help you choose the wine.  The employees of this restaurant are well-versed in the nuances of their wine selections and will help you find a reasonably priced bottle that pairs well with your menu choices and preferences.  Third, when you eat here, \""\""go all out\""\"".  That means, get ready to eat a lot, and prepare to enjoy yourself thoroughly.  This is a restaurant tailored for those who enjoy a cozy, comfortable atmosphere, nice people, and good food.  Again, if you are looking for a trendy restaurant, go to Morimoto.  The food won't be NEARLY as good, but you'll find all of the wannabe hipsters you can handle.  I know this is a strong review, but I believe every word of it.  There are a lot of excellent restaurants in Philadelphia that may enjoy more \""\""street cred\""\"" (think Le Bec Fin, Morimoto, Buddhakan, etc.), but certainly do not deserve it.  This restaurant is absolutely terrific, and if you walk in with an open mind (and granted, an open wallet), you will absolutely enjoy it as much as I do.  Enjoy.  This will be one of your better dining experiences, anywhere.  --WEM"", ""Absolutely no complaints.

After educating myself on issues with Windshields, I asked Hector who was the manufacturer of the glass they used. He told me who they used, why they used them, and why they were top quality. Other companies in town did not respond to this question...seriously, the top rated guy on Yelp, quit answering my emails when I asked him who manufactured the glass he used...REALLY? Now, the kicker is Tony's price was the lowest of all 4 I contacted. And, not just a few dollars...he charged $125 including taxes...I had no idea you could get a front windshield replaced for that.

We had no reservation and were dressed rather casually, and despite the fact that it was Saturday night and they were very busy and pretty booked up, the ma\u00eetre d' was able to work us in with absolutely no waiting. Kudos to his efforts!  Since others here have already reviewed the menu offerings, all I'm going to add is (dare I say?) if you're in the mood and it looks good on the menu, it will be.   The atmosphere is Elegant South Philadelphia Italian, cozy, and warm. Our servers  treated us like royalty, and were extremely attentive despite the fact that we were still in our rather natty sneakers. Each knew the menu and dinner specials inside out, no small task, I can assure you.  Parking is tough in town, and if you just can't bring yourself to pay for the valet parking (it's only 8 bucks, for Pete's sake!), stick it out and don't stop searching until you find a spot - it's well worth the time and effort. And make sure you pay any parking fees - thePPA NEVER takes a break from writing tickets in this city because such a large amount of revenue is generated from the restaurant districts.

Second, this doctor's interest is mainly in selling you things you don't need or want.  She tried to get me to buys some expensive eye drops so my eyes would not be dry (I never said my eyes were dry!).  Then, she tried to get me to change my contact lens brand, even though I told her I had been very happy with my current brand for years. She even wrote my main prescription for her brand of choice and added a side note (that you could barely read) of the different prescription if I want to order my brand.  Obviously she has some incentive to push her brand.   Finally, my prescription was actually wrong. She changed things in my prescription (not just the power) that had stayed the same for many many years. And did not explain why.  And all this is after I waited 30 minutes after my appointment time.

I am within walking distance and avoid this theater.  I'd rather drive out of town then waste my money going here.   Today I decided to give them another try only because there was a free screening being offered.  Gofobo apparently rents space to do screenings at Loews.  I understand it is a separate company.  I understand that they are not affiliated but when you rent space to a company that poorly runs events at your facility it is a reflection on your business as well.  That aside, a little courtesy and  goes a long way.  I do not understand why people with no customer service skills decide to work in a service industry.  How they become managers is also a mystery.   Gofobo offered a free screening at Loews today.  The representative stated that over 500 tickets were issued for the screening.  As a matter of fact, while I was at the theater I was able to see that tickets were still being offered online.  However, after a 1 hour wait (longer for many others) we were told that the theater was full. I do not remember the exact number but the theater held less than 200!  Less than 200 yet over 500 tickets were given out!    Here is where I have an issue with Loews.  I asked to see the theater manager.  I was upset that I had wasted my day.  I had gotten a baby sitter for my infant son and planned to have a day with my daughter.  We went out in the rain expecting to see a movie and after waiting in a line for an hour while peoples purses were searched and a few people were let in at a time we were then told the theater was full.  We were told to leave our email address and we would be issued tickets for a future screening.  I waited for a manager.  What a waste.  The manager, \""\""Nicole\""\"" was very rude.  All she needed to say was, \""\""I am very sorry.  I understand\""\"".  Instead she stared at me and only said, \""\""OK\""\"" in response to everything I said to her.  No Nicole, it is not OK.  It is not okay that my time was wasted.  If you couldn't offer to let us into a different movie how about at least offering some empathy and simply saying I am sorry for the confusion then pass the blame onto Gofobo.  I feel sorry for your staff.  I hope you do not treat them as poorly as you treat customers!  Time to brush up on your customer service skills!  You really do not belong working in management in the service industry.    My past experiences with Loews have been poor.  We were there a few months ago and it was gross.  The floors and cup holders were sticky.  Food spilled everywhere.  The bathrooms were also gross.  This was the second bad experience in a row.  I had said then that I would not be back.  The only reason I gave them another try was because it was a free screening.  In the future, free wont even get me to go back there.

I decided to get the taco special and 1 chicken tamale to try (im still seachung for great tamales).

We ready to go soon enough and we ask for separate check which the waiter said that she could do. However she did not bring out separate checks. In fact my coworker had to ask how much her meal was. The waitress had to go back and count up for her total and then come back and tell her how much the her portion was. Well knowing that I only spent about $7 in the restaurant I did not think I needed to do the same. Mistake. I was very surprised when found out my meal was almost $11 when my card was ran. Apparently it was extra for the cilantro onion even know the meal came with tomatoes and lettuce which I asked for instead. Never was told it was extra. I knew I had to pay for extra chees, but dang!  Management came out upon my request to give me a breakdown of the bill, especially since I couldn't get itemized bill. I was not happy, not buying the explaination, nor impressed. They give me a small, change of a refund and vowed to NEVER be back.

They also do not sub-contract heat treatments anymore, which is helpful in only having to work with one contractor and not multiple; they have invested in the equipment needed for heat treatments which require a lot of coordination. I definitely recommend!"", ""The variety of ice cream flavors offered here is ridiculous, and no matter which flavor you end up going with, you will not be disappointed. Great place for an afternoon stroll!"", ""We just got back from our cemetery tour with Ernie. We were thrilled with Ernie, he was very knowledgable and entertaining on top of that. Not only did he educate us on some history of NOLA, he made us laugh and enjoy the time. As we walked through St. Louis Cemetery, I overheard other tour guides giving their tour; wow was I glad I booked with Ernie and not them....lighten up people and be a little more energetic like Ernie!"", ""This place is my absolute fave! The flavors are spot on, they taste exactly the way you imagine, but better! The strawberries & champagne, toasted marshmallow, and cheesecake  are a few of my personal favorites. I moved to Phoenix a few years back and was ecstatic when I found out they opened locations in the valley. This is a Tucson gem that I will continue to visit over and over!"", ""Great food and service as well. The shrimp app is really good and the burger is one of the best I have ever had."", ""Great breakfast! I had the egg, sausage, bacon, hash and short stacks! One of the best breakfast places I've had since Kirby Lane in Austin, TX! We will eat there again before we leave NOLA!"", ""Top Hog has the best hamburgers in the universe and their sweet tea will fix anything that ails you. Great people, fantastic food and reasonable prices. Can't beat that!!"", ""By far one of the best meals/experiences I've ever had in the city. Our server Bill was fabulous; the chef came out frequently and visited our table. If you are looking for great service, food and overall experience- this place will exceed your expectations!"", ""Though seemingly Inconpicuous driving by, this turned out to be a good place to go for a good haircut. Good conversation and attention to detail means that I'll come back again to see if they can duplicate the experience."", ""Great yoga and great workout. Only problem I think they heat the room too much they need to think about how many students there are then heat accordingly"", ""This is my favorite place to visit, mostly because of the praline chees cake, but the food is great also. The fried chicken is usually my go to dish, but this time I went with the fried shrimp. It's was fried perfectly not over cooked. I got the collard greens and potato salad side. All Good! Then of course finish with the cheesecake with praline sauce. This sauce needs to be bottled a sold. It's a creamy caramel sauce with rum.  It's sooooo good. Please try this place nestled in the back of the French quarter where the locals are."", ""Great great place. Everything in this tiny restaurant was quality..from the friendly service to the amazing food. The staff makes you feel like you're home."", ""What a great way to spend the afternoon!   We (5 girls celebrating our 30th birthdays) agreed that we had to do some sort of swamp tour while we were in NOLA in April.  We booked online and drove ourselves the 35 minutes to Slidell (for a few bucks more, you can get shuttled there).  We showed up right at our tour time, so we were worried that we wouldn't have enough time to check in, use the restroom, and get to the boat before it left.  Thankfully for us, Canjun Encounters offered a \""\""late\""\"" boat for us tardy folks, which left 15 minutes after our scheduled tour time.  Whew.  Our guide, Captain Troy, was fantastic.  He took us quickly up the river, stopping occasionally to give us some interesting factoids about the area.  Then, we quietly floated into the swamp.  It's gorgeous!  And Captain Troy continued to give us more great info about the swamp and its inhabitants.  Due to the unseasonably cold weather, we didn't see any alligators up close.  However, we did get to pass around someone's pet baby alligator.  Too cool!  And we got to see someother wildlife, like birds, turtles, snakes, and spiders.  I guess my only complaint is that we used a covered boat, which hindered our view of the swamp a little bit.  Other than that, our swamp experience with Cajun Encounters was fantastic.  Highly recommended!  *Tip: go to Southside Cafe for lunch.  It's only a few miles away, and the food was AMAZING."", ""I took my car in for a 36,000-mile check up. I made an appointment online. My car was done in about 30 minutes. Everyone I encountered was extremely pleasant and friendly. I left smiling. I am very happy with this service department. Free snacks and drinks by the TV and free wifi. Free car wash with repair/service, too!"", ""I'm usually a chilaquiles girl, so the Huevos Rancheros sounded sort of tempting with its eggs, tortillas and salsa combination. Now, huevos rancheros in general has never really appealed to me, but Tavern had me changing my tune. I have a feeling that no other restaurant's version of this dish will impress me as much as this one, but if you are in Nashville and you are at Tavern for brunch and you don't get the Huevos Rancheros.... you're making a HUGE mistake. One of the best brunch meals of my life y'all..."", ""Katie's has been a frequent stop for me when in New Orleans but usually for lunch or late night eating.  This morning, my wife and I were leaving to go home and decided on brunch.  I ordered the steak and eggs.  It comes with a side and fruit salad.  The steak was about a 6 oz. ribeye which I ordered medium-rare with eggs over-easy.  Service was excellent and our meal was delivered promptly despite the fact that the restaurant and bar were at full capacity.  Biting into the steak I was amazed.  It was char-grilled to perfection, tender and sooo flavorful.  Completely unlike most breakfast steaks you get.  I daresay this steak was better than many I've had at high-end chop houses!  The eggs were perfect.  While the hashbrowns were OK, I am not a fan.  They were quartered new potatoes with a batter that was sugared.  Hashbrowns shouldn't be sweet!  Overall a tremendous experience gastronomically.  Katie's usually has a lot of specialty dishes off the menu (Check the chalkboards at the doorways), but if you're there for breakfast/brunch - get the steak & eggs!"", ""Had a wonderful experience today with my daughter and soon to be daughter in law.  Great job Lana and GiGi!.  Absolutely recommend."", ""Definitely a good go to burger place. The chicken stew they currently have though.... OMFG! YUM!!"", ""Harry and Izzy's is classy and delightful. I am really taken by the Art Deco/1920s style. If you are in the mood for a stellar cocktail with a sophisticated atmosphere this is your best bet.  The bar has an awesome view of Georgia which makes for great people watching. The outdoor seating is also a major plus. And talk about good food. You get what you pay for. Very high quality service combined with perfectly prepared gourmet food.  I have never had a bad experience, I just wish I could afford to eat here more often.""]",20

The staff is a bunch of inexperienced kids for whom this must be their first job, the food is still crappy (but not microwaved, the owner will tell you that), and the bathrooms and tables are still dirty.  What can you expect from a place that got dinged by the board of health for cooking with camp stoves?  Save your money, the place isn't learning from their mistakes."", ""On a recent trip to TN for a \""\""best friends\""\"" reunion we decided, pretty spontaneously, to get matching tattoos celebrating our 15 year friendship! We didn't have any expectations about being able to get into a tattoo parlour especially one with the reputation of Black 13! However, Black 13 even though fully booked, went out of their way to accommodate us knowing 3 of us had to return to CT! In addition to cleanliness, the staff was VERY polite and Ryan did EXACTLY what we wanted! I would highly recommend Black 13 and I definitely plan to return next time I'm in the area!!!!!!!!!"", ""Very disappointing food.  Too bad I cannot give a minus 1 star. The food was just below average and overpriced. I know Good Peruvian food, I also know a bad imitation trying to pass for decent food. The bad service was also another disappointment.

Will not return there."", ""This place is terrible! I've been coming here for a few years with my daughters and although they are more stingy with toppings than other salad works - my kids don't mind. Usually most of their toppings get easily transferred to my salad. However today, Alexa who's the shift leader said \""\""toppings don't transfer\""\"" and even though my daughter didn't get a topping and they don't offer a discount - I can't get her topping on my salad. It's utterly ridiculous to consistently pay $30 for 3 salads every two weeks at this establishment but thanks to Alexa - I won't be coming here EVER AGAIN. THANKS!"", ""Had been there once before for a simple tune up, and everything went fine. That was back right after they opened, so I figured a simple state inspection would be no problem.   Wrong!  I dropped the car off on Saturday afternoon, and Miguel asked me if I wouldn't mind leaving it overnight in case they didn't finish before closing time on Saturday. I needed the car back the next morning, but Miguel assured me it would be done by the time they opened, at 10am.   I called on Sunday at 10:30, and not only had the inspection not been done yet, \""\""they guy who does inspections didn't come in this morning.\""\"" So I went and took the car back, no inspection competed.

I was given incorrect information about the internet service that was provided, the pillowcases were inside out so I called reception to let them know, they gave me another code for the internet and said they would let housekeeping know about the pillow cases. There was also an ashtray in a supposedly non smoking room which let her (Tiffany) know also)... My 7 year old son and I both fell asleep around 8pm. At 10.20 there was loud knocking on our door which woke me up. It was a 'security guard' who was insisting that I need to open the door and speak with her. I pulled back the curtains and she couild clearly see that I was in my pj's and I informed her that we were sleeping and I would not open the door unless she could give me a valid reason which she did not. I called up the front desk and spoke with Tiffany who said that it was fine she would let the security guard know that she was not needed. I then got back into bed... 2 minutes later the security guard CALLS ME, starts telling me that if I have any further small complaints they will boot me out of the hotel. She was extremely rude and behaving in a threatening manner. I called the police who came about half an hour later. The police office came to my room after going to reception first despite that fact that it was I who called THEM as I felt threatened. And she informed me that they were asking me to leave the premises. By this time it was after 11pm. My 7yo son was fast asleep, I had to wake him up, go and get a refund for TWO of the three nights I had paid for as they refused to issue me one for tonight and find another Hotel. I am ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED at being treated in such a manner. I have stayed in HUNDREDS of Motels and have NEVER been treated so badly. I asked the Hotel Manager to make sure the CCTV footage was saved so that when I go to a lawyer about this we will have all of those conversations on tape! That security guard should be ASHAMED of herself for treating people so badly. Had she come to my door and asked if everything was okay, I would have responded yes it was (we WERE sleeping) and she could have gone on her way."", ""Like many other reviewers I passed by this place a number of times before looking it up on Yelp and realizing that I really did need to give it a shot... Wow... I was not disappointed! We started out with the crab cake appetizer- it was very well portioned (2 large crab cakes) and the sauce with it had an interesting hint of dill (just lovely and refreshing and a little different). We were feeling like comfort food and had the chicken tenders-  The portions were very generous and the food was just solid.  Not fussy or stuffy or trying hard... just good, wholesome and good to eat. The service was fine- however there is only one waitress for the tables and the bar, so i can imagine that if it is full that would cause some delays.  Overall it was just a lovely meal and the prices were unbelievably reasonable (most places have crabcakes 1/2 that size for twice that price)... The ambiance is nice, nothing crazy but it is just a very nice option with reasonable prices and lovely food!"", ""So I'm not sure what the big deal is over this place. Your Clarksville Tn location has nothing but positive reviews. We were looking forward to having a nice family dinner at your Springfield location tonight. However that sadly did not happen my husband found his food bland and lacking seasoning of any kind he ordered just a simple cheeseburger. And I ordered your salmon with a Baked potato and garden salad. My Salmon was RAW in the middle and I don't mean just slightly pink there was a good half a inch to a inch worth of RAW salmon I sent it back to be recooked. Well when it came back out it was clear my dinner had been place in most likely a Microwave  the ends that I had pulled apart for my 8 year old to eat prior to realizing the fish was RAW  were now so dry and curled over. When I asked the manager who brought me my food back if they microwaved my fish I was told NO. Problem here my fish came back to me the exact way I sent it to be recooked nothing on the plate was out of place. My husband and I are truly disappointed we had high hopes for PBODY'S."", ""Terrible, just terrible!  They need to tear this place down immediately.  I remember going here in the 80's for decent pizza & to a movie, but time has passed this place buy.  I went into Kmart to look for backpacks just a week ago and even that was a bad experience.  All there stuff looked old and outdated.   Why don't they turn this place into a Target, its practically empty anyway.  Either the stores have gone out of business for lack of shoppers or wisely moved elsewhere.  Sorry to see this location die a slow death, but its no more than an eye sore now."", ""These gentlemen saved me!  I had bizarre issues with my car driving from the Bay to Reno. I was treated daily and not price gouged like other quotes I got that weekend."", ""Won't go back. Service was great, but the food was awful.

Had the cuban sandwich and the chocolate and coconut dessert - FANTASTIC!!!!!"", ""My Samsung 650 TV would not turn on. The red light in the front panel just goes on and off. I call Caden. First they charged $40.00 to come over to look at. Then he wrote a bill for $410.00 for repair. I guess I  look old and dumb, but he seems to be sincere. So I let him do the work. Next day, he said he had fixed the problem and will bring over. The TV came back and he gave me a 6 months warranty. I did some research on this problem and found out it is only the capacity problem. And it is relatively cheap to fix. The maximum will cost you for less than $180.00. So, watch out for Caden to sock to you. Call other first before you call him."", ""We actually come here often for different products, however this place needs a lot of work or different management. The management hides in the little office and never comes out to help regardless of people needing help. They need several more employees and I've sent several of my students from UNR needing part time orfull time but the hiring process is so crazy nobody's interested! Lastly most bathrooms at the gas stations are cleaner than this bathroom. It's crazy filthy. And this is supposed to be kind of a professional place. We've been coming here for a long time and these observations are over a period of consistent observation. I just finally decided to write a review. I think we will switch to the mud town location."", ""Awful! Typical Philly \""\""hot spot\""\"" that appeals to hipsters and snobs that would rather have a \""\""scene\""\"" than quality dining. We ordered several pizzas. They were thin with burnt crust and room temperature. Worst of all they were $15-16 a pop! Insane. I could stay in the suburbs and go to a mom & pop joint where real unpretentious folks go and get a pizza ten-times as good for half the cost!  Plastic chairs and little to no atmosphere. The service wasn't bad and that was the high point! I hate that places like this can actually be successful. A total half-assed effort catered to mindless hipsters and wannabes that think it's cool to do the Philly thing for a few years. Real Philly people know where to get Pizza and Vetri ain't it!"", ""I phoned this restaurant on December 28th and booked a reservation (I thought) for December 29th.  When we arrived at the restaurant, a completely unapologetic, in fact, rude, person informed us that they don't take reservations, and they could not possibly accommodate our party of 5, because they were short-staffed.  He hoped we would come another time, but if we didn't, oh well....  Apparently the \""\""reservation\""\"" had been taken by an old man who used to own the restaurant, but doesn't anymore.  The disdain we felt from this person, whether head waiter, server, owner (!) will not quickly be forgotten, and we left, vowing never to come back.    I had $200 worth of gift certificates, which I sold at a loss, rather than be reminded of the Parkallen Restaurant.   Incidently, the restaurant had at least 3 tables which could have been arranged to accommodate our party.  They just wanted nothing to do with us.  I understand this restaurant has new ownership - I wish for their failure. It cannot possibly matter whether the food is good or not, when the service is this atrocious."", ""Decent service, but food was subpar.  Stuff flounder tasted like mush.  Everything else was full of grease and lacking in flavor.  First and last time here....."", ""I'll start this off by saying I've worked in the food industry as a server, bartender, expo, busser, dishwasher, etc for 10 plus years. I now work with disabled persons trying to help them find employment. We're not supposed to meet them in their home as per company policy. My client, who is disabled, and I have visited this pizzeria a few times per her request because it's close to her house and she feels comfortable meeting there. Today we went in at 1:45pm and I noticed it was busier than usual (typically we go at a time where it is not busy restaurant hours.) Before going to sit down like we normally do, and again this was only our third time here, We were greeted aggressively and immediately by who I assume is the owner. I started to ask \""\""do you mind if we sit here..\""\"" and was cut off. He said, \""\""I have a real problem with you coming in here not buying anything and sitting taking up a table for 2-3 hours.\""\"" (Mind you, we have never been there the previous 2 times over an hour and 15 minutes - as I have a limited amount of time I am able to work with each client.  There also has been about 15 other open tables in the restaurant each time we were there, including today.) This person responded very hostile and aggressive. Had the gentleman asked politely if I purchased a drink or a slice of pizza we could sit and go about our business, however he met me with an extremely volatile attitude and aggressive choice of words. Again, as someone who's worked in the food industry, I understand how it can be frustrating for someone to come in and sit without purchasing anything. With that said, how this employee decided to treat me in this moment made me and my disabled client extremely uncomfortable. The rudeness was completely unnecessary and being familiar with the industry I wouldn't have minded at all purchasing something from this place in order to sit there for an hour, had I been spoken to appropriately. The part I feel the worst about is how my client was treated. I had to explain to her why \""\""that man was so rude\""\"". It's unacceptable how me and my client were made to feel today. She's already treated differently in the world and she felt terrible after this interaction. I'm mortified that this had to happen in this way, and this whole situation could have been completely avoided had we been treated like human beings. What the employee was trying to say was completely justified, however we were yelled at and made to feel like we were unwelcome for no reason whatsoever. I will not be entering this restaurant again for obvious reasons, and I encourage anyone who has any empathy for disabled persons to do the same. Again, the way we were treated was completely reprehensible and could have been avoided completely."", ""New to town and tried several in town but no availability on a Sunday.

Paid extra for opi nail polish instead of old nail polish they had as a selection. Waste of money and time.""]",4

After reading alot of positive reviews from Yelp users for this place I finally made it down to Rockville Road to try for my self. I went during lunch and ordered the Grilled Beef spring rolls and the Grilled Pork Banh Mi.  The spring rolls were made fresh and had grilled beef, vermicilli and mint wrapped inside served with a side chili/fish sauce. These were very fresh tasting and that mint added just the right amount of herby-ness.  The Banh Mi was SO GOOD! Now I am a Banh Mi snob...yeah I said it. I believe that as with any sandwich the bread accounts for 50% of how good or bad a sandwich is. You can have the best toppings in the world but if you dont have the right crusty/chewy/soft bread to serve it in, whats the point?!?!?  Pho 36's Grilled Prok Banh Mi met all my criteria. It was a decent size (12\""\""), pork was grilled just enough and not dry. The mayo on the sandwich tasted homemade. The toppongs (shredded carrots/shredded daikon radish/cilantro) were super fresh and added a great crunch. Add a lil Siracha and were off! Alot of Banh Mi sandwiches tend to not be filing enough (hence me ordering the spring rolls on this trip as well) but Pho 36's sandwich was just the right size for me and was filling.  The resturant itself is small (maybe 25-30 seats) but it was very clean and the gentlman who took my order was very knowledgable about the menu and had answers to all my questions.

But let me tell you about our service! First the server brought out the wrong wine for my sisters (they got a red cab Mendoza, a white Chardonnay was delivered). Nobody really checked on us except to ask if we wanted to order more food. Then! One of my sisters PULLED A REALLY LONG HAIR OUT OF HER MOUTH AFTER TAKING A BITE OF FOOD!!!!!!!! When we alerted our server, his response was, \""\""ew, I'll be sure to tell the chef.\""\""  NEVER did we get an apology, nor was the item replaced nor taken off the check!!!!! And on top of that, he charged us for the red AND the white wine!!!!! The sister who had the hair is super polite and it was impressive that she even alerted him of the hair, so unfortunately she did not fight to have the item taken off, regardless of my urging her to do so.

The crab cakes I remembered as delicious morsels of ambrosia turned out to be overly greasy, too little crab, and much too little taste. At least they were edible. The grilled snapper (fish of the day) and asparagus that I got on the side were overcooked and drowned in butter as if this could hide the unmistakable blandness of the food.  I was quite literally crushed. Hoping this is was symptomatic of the location and not the chain.

Two giant scoops of rice and just \""\""dollops\""\"" of \""\""sides\""\"" to accompany the \""\""dollop\""\"" of curried goat. Oh, and also one plantain on top. Maybe for garnish :/  The yellow rice was dry but good flavor, the other white/pink one just dry and no flavor to it at all, the cabbage undercooked and the curried goat (which was the main dish) was great.

I finally had to ask a manager where our cocktails we're because it so long.  - not in my world if I'm paying $180!   2.  First course came while we were still eating our soup..so we had 2 plates in front of us on a cramped table.  Hello serving 101 at like the most basic restaurant in the world..Don't bring the next course when people are still eating their first!  Again I would expect shit like this to happen if I were at TGI Fridays but I wasn't at TGI Fridays.  I was at SPRAGA. 4. The waiter tried to remove plates while we were still eating from them.  Say what?  Not when I'm paying $180 on a meal son!  You leave the plate until I am finished! 5.  The waiter would awkwardly come to the table and just stand there.. Obviously we know he came to take our food order or dessert order but you say \""\"" Is everyone ready?.. I'd like to take your order\""\"" etc.  WTF.  Nope he just stood there... Weird!   6.  Empty glasses/butter dishes left on the table throughout the meal.  Sloppy.  The server tries to take plates we are still eating from but leaves sangria glasses etc for the entire meal?  I just.  Don't.  Get it.    All in all food was good, not amazing and I've had better service at Tangier.  If you are going to spend that much money go somewhere else."", ""At approximately 5:30PM 1/29/16 my husband and I arrived at the Charlie Brown's in Springfield PA and instantly had to wait to be seated for several minutes, no host readily available and no apology upon her late arrival to seat us. Once seated, our server Mike was below satisfactory at best. Salad bar was satisfactory to almost neglected. I asked for lemon with my diet soda, none arrived. I ordered the cheeseburger meal with French fries, no ketchup or condiments offered. I had to wait until he came back in the area to ask for ketchup. The server, Mike was not attentive at all. When I asked for another diet, he never brought it and forgot that I asked. However, he also did not check on us as much as we observed that he checked on other patrons. I noticed that we were a table of color (African American), maybe this had no influence, maybe it did. I requested to speak with the manager (Jennifer-I believe). I explained my concerns and her immediate fix was to pay the tab, I informed her that this was not what my complaint was about. My  experience was that of poor service. I paid my tab and did not feel like the restaurant was at all concerned about their reputation. I was completely insulted by the wait person and lack of managerial leadership by the manager. I thought you would want to know."", ""I pop in here for a manicure whenever I get a chance. They look good and last longer than many of mine do. The space is really light and airy, which is nice, and I love that they carry Smith & Cult polish.   I do wish they had another area for you to sit while you wait for your nails to dry, because I'm a huge klutz and pretty much always smudge them. Not a huge deal though!  ALSO, Raine is absolutely amazing if you need a wax--she's so fast (15 min) and really minimizes the ouch factor.""]",7

Go to ANY other Taco Bell and you wont! I have tried several times through the years and it never fails! They don't care about how long you wait! Wasn't even offered a apology for the wait! I asked why in the world is always so long of a wait here? Brooke just shrugged her shoulders and said,\""\"" we are just short handed..\""\"" which seems to always be the case! I wish they would just shut it down! Worse service ever! Laughing and flirting with other employees at the window!

Amazing brunch!!"", ""Order from here frequently and I am never disappointed. However, today, they even exceeded my expectations ten-fold. It is a miserable, rainy day with residual rain from Hurricane Harvey and I am not in the mood to go pick up pizza so I placed an order. They were here in record time, again with piping hot delicious pizza. I complimented the delivery driver on the promptness and he was adorable. Thank you for the wonderful service and excellent food every time I order."", ""Everything about this place makes me SOOO happy. From the staff to the food to the patio - there are a few reasons why I have been here almost as many days I've been in Nashville. Keep it up y'all!"", ""This is a review as someone who plays board games and paints miniatures.   This is a huge shop with some of the best prices in town. The selection of games is great. No Privateer Press miniatures or Malifaux and their GW is only some new stuff (though I am sure you can order through the shop). Their X-Wing selection is huge. The board game selection is big and literally wraps around the shop. Can be a bit intimidating checking out the games in the section where games are being played but it can be fun to watch other games being played. The staff is helpful but can seem absent since the shop is so huge. Lots of room to play games and meet up with folks to play."", ""Visited here while staying in town at a hotel with my dog. So much better than the dog parks in New York! Beautiful park, kept up nice, clean, beautiful bridge, lovely stream, and fenced in area for doggie play. What more can you ask for?"", ""Awesome place for the guys to get a haircut.  All the barbers were friendly and eager very eager to cut the next customers hair. Highly recommend going here."", ""I love The Studio. Every yoga class I have taken there has been unique, professional and awesome. The teachers are highly trained and each so diverse in their area of expertise. Also the massages are some of the best I've ever had. To complete the experience you can enjoy a fresh organic juice or salad and other goodies downstairs. I Highly recommend the Studio."", ""Great staff, service and food!  I ordered the kale salad (OMGosh - good!), short ribs tacos and the fried cauliflower- a MUST - even if you don't finish it all."", ""This is my go to restaurant! Omnivore, vegan, gluten free... All are welcome. The beef jerky is so yummy. The Kings soup is also one of my favorites.  The Naam salad is the best thing on the menu. West Philly gem."", ""A great place for cheap, ripe produce. Because it's ripe, it's better to buy as you need rather than in advance for a week. Love this place!"", ""Amazing location, perfect weather and of course delicious beers and ciders all from Indiana! Doesn't get much better than this! I don't consider myself a brew snob and I am probably the furthest from it, however even if you don't like beer so much, there is something for you here! The early bird ticket is only $10 extra but definitely worth it as you not only get in an hour early, but a lot of the breweries that are set up have a special beer that they are only handing out at this time! I would definitely recommend ubering here rather than driving (unless you have a DD) as you definitely get your money's worth!"", ""This was my first time getting my nails done and I had a great experience. Victor was attentive and easy to talk to. He made sure I was happy every step of the way and answered any questions I had. The salon itself had a relaxed atmosphere. I'd definitely recommend!"", ""Feeling compelled to write this review laying in bed, dreaming about the Pro Tap Burger - what every other burger out there wants to be when it grows up. I don't love this burger just because it's literally a block away from me - I would walk 500 miles to fall down at Pro Taps door for this burger. I am also a HUGE fan of brioche buns. Fries are covered in a garlicky herb situation unlike any you've had before. Do yourself a favor and skip your kids recital, blow off that friend you've been playing phone tag with for weeks... but don't bring your friend who's all like \""\""are these gluten free vegan fries?\""\""... get some of their seriously awesome beers, a burger, maybe start off w some of their mac and cheese? I'm just sayin....."", ""Sarah is a great barista! She knees exactly what I meant when I said \""\""that's apple thing.

My room mate who worked at Starbucks for several years says the same thing!"", ""This is the best place we have ever ordered sushi from. We refer so many people to this restaurant because we know they are always consistent. The food is always fresh and delicious. The hibachi is also fantastic and fun. Way more than enough food. The scallops are phenomenal too. We have had a lot of different sushi rolls here and all of them are fantastic. You can't wrong. The fried rice is awesome. You can't go to this restaurant without eating the fried rice or you will miss out. Our meals range from $60 on up depending on what you order. The best suggestion I can make if you want to save money is to go during lunch. You can get the lunch box and it has a little bit of everything. The owner is awesome he remembers everyone that comes on. Every time we walk in he makes us feel so welcome and he even remembers if we don't have kids with us or not. I highly recommend this place!!! :)"", ""So happy there is a family friendly place to watch football in Carp! Great atmosphere, fast service, delicious pizza."", ""Family, friends, and everyone you are happy to meet. All under one roof. I have some feels for this place and they all come from the caring hearts of this establishments owners. Amazingly the staff all remember me by name each time I stop by. I usually stick to the salmon dinners and wings. But when I do indulge? Its the angel hair alfredo with sauteed chicken. I have dreams about food when I diet heavy. And this is one of my normal courses in la la land. My favorite place for all that it is and will be. Thanks to Robert and Henry and their lovely family and staff for always making me feel important. Not to be confused with impotent."", ""One of our favorite breakfast spots! Almost always a small wait but they are on top of their service and turn tables quickly.

If you like to sing come on a Saturday night, they do karaoke and have about every song you can think of! Come sing! It's all around one of my favorite bars in Carmel, if you haven't been come in and check it out!  Ask for Rob at the bar, he will take care of you with fast and friendly service!

The food is ON point!! The chefs are total artists and it's beautiful to watch. Had the ahi poke and spicy chicken ramen. Can't wait to go back!!!"", ""Great little dive restaurant with fantabulous seafood. Nothing fancy on the decor. Waitresses are very attentive. Food is hot, fresh, and some of the best oysters in the NOLA area. They also have a fish market next door that has fresh fish and other Cajun specialty foods. The restaurant is a great \""\""hole in the wall\""\"" type restaurant with no frills. Oh and they have a full bar with drink specials! This place is a great place if you want to go low key for an amazing meal!"", ""Staff is amazing here.  So helpful and supportive when we stayed in 2015.  They knew we had a lot of stuff to load in our car, plus two little kids, so they let us take our time.  We were way past the checkout hour by the time we left, lol!  Hotel room was always clean, house keeping always prompt.   They left the room neat as a pin.  The breakfast had a lot of variety, including beverages.  The breakfast area was nice to sit and relax in.  The hotel itself is beautiful.  You could tell the staff paid attention to cleanliness and detail.  Only thing I was kind of put off by was that the bathroom and shower room didn't have locks, but that was a minor issue.  I don't give five stars easily, lol, so I would definitely recommend this hotel!"", ""There is no help in the appliance section. If you do receive help they don't know what they are talking about.

Southwest corner of US19 & Gulf to Bay. Specializing in sandwiches, pizza, soups &salads, all fresh and taken up a notch.  I chose Newk's Q sandwich which is sliced, flame broiled chicken, thick cut bacon and imported Swiss cheese served in a crispy semi-soft sub roll with their signature white BBQ sauce. Very delicious. Then I ordered  a bowl of corn and crab soup. Great flavor and a half Caesar salad which had fresh, crisp lettuce, toasted, seasoned croutons and plenty of Caesar dressing. All very flavorful. All that and an Imported bottle of Italian water for $10. I used one of the $5 off coupons direct mailed to my home. You order at a counter. You're given a number to display on your table and food is brought to you.   Manager and personnel very friendly and helpful. Nicely designed interior with an outside patio. Good quality entrees, lots of menu variety. They also have Mac n cheese and a dessert menu from Brownie's to home made cakes. Great format. I'll be back."", ""Heard this place from a friend. Also food and people here! Very clean! Highly recommended"", ""One word: fabulous! I came to Duck Donuts to get a dozen donuts for my mom's birthday.

Incredible food too...Pork Belly Sliders and Edamame. Amazing, ridiculous even whiskey selection."", ""This place is awesome.  They have High Life, and the food's not bad either.  One time I was eating here Sean Payton and some buddies came in.  People went up to their table, but not many, because it's NOLA, we don't do that here unless it's the Saints.  I waited till he was leaving and walked past our table to ask for a picture.  He's awesome. The Sean Payton story overshadowed that we had absolutely terrible service that afternoon, but the manager comp'ed our meal, and every other time I've eaten here things have been great.  BTW, for White Linen Night, the wife and I stopped here to get a couple of High Lifes to go.  The bartender hooked us up, we walked out in less than 5 minutes, and the place was packed.  Also, been to the upstairs part on an Abita pub crawl, nice space, never been back up there though."", ""Highly, highly overrated.  The food was a C minus at best.

You walk in and they've got 4-6 cauldrons full of your choices...which are written in sidewalk chalk on a blackboard. There's always something vegetarian, and a plate full of any of it costs five fitty. Add a buck and you can get a split plate of 2 delectable cajun creations with rice. But the best part is the ridiculously awesome garlic bread...which you can get a bowl of for like a buck.  Not only is the food awesome, but the owner (Joe Vuskovich) is a local celebrity. He's a famed restaurateur from New Orleans that sells his secret spice to restaurants everywhere. Everybody in town knows him (despite the fact that there are two other locations) and he's highly supportive of local bands and kids that most older people stay away from."", ""I love to review a place like Granny's because I prefer to write positive reviews rather than negative ones!   I have been a customer of Granny's for almost 20 years and have never, I repeat NEVER been disappointed!!!   They always get my car in promptly when I need work, they stick to the qoute that they give me and I haven't ever had to take the car back for additional work!

I have had the opportunity to refer Granny's to several friends and I think that they are all still loyal customers as well."", ""BEST. SUSHI. IN. TOWN. The place itself doesn't look like anything special; a few table and a sushi bar. However, the fish is always fresh and well prepared.

Turns out, they had a room available, and I was able to get right in around 6am. Truly grateful as I woke up at 4:00 this morning so getting a 30 minute power nap on the comfy hotel bed before heading out was a real treat. The room is nice. I like the layout. Very open with lots of windows. Magnificent views of the city and you don't hear traffic at all from the upper levels. I ordered room service and the food was great. Later, I accidentally locked myself out of my room and security helped me get back in. They checked my ID to make sure it was actually my room, which is good practice. I was apologetic but the security guy was so nice. Everyone I've interacted with today has been a joy. I wish I remembered the valet's name this morning. He was wonderful.

I have never been to a place like this- just altogether special in decor, service, food and drink... You will not regret swinging by here.  One, the place is adorable. Upon first glance, one might note that it is reminiscent of an old industrial factory, but more like a factory that a group of rag-tag children made into a playhouse. Vibrant color, flowers, natural lights fun stair cases, decorative window panes... Really fun environment.   Service was a little slow, but considering they were packed to the brim because of our conference I let it slide. Waitress and hostess were really friendly.   This place has delicious and fresh burgers that come in such unique flavor combinations. I came back a second time just to try another one. First one I had was the Hog-Thai'ed which was a peanut glazed burger served with Thai rice noodles. SOOOOOO GOOOD. The one I had the next day was the American. (If you're worried about your cardiovascular health, please don't eat this one.) it is your classic bacon burger topped with melted cheese and fried Mac-n-cheese. Let's just say it changed me. Fries are amazing and paired perfectly with their unique sauces. Loved the sriracha mayo. A must try.   They also serve a million types of sodas including draft sodas, shakes (loved the cinnamon shake) as well as boozy shakes which are as wonderful wd they sound.

This \""\""business man\""\"" is not who or what he claims to be. He is not nice, professional, or reliable. I am baffled at this man's success within the local community; all things come to the light eventually.   My personal headache with this I met the \""\""proprietor\""\"" out last summer, he was a nice enough guy, we had a bunch of mutual acquaintances. When he told me what he did, as shoe junkie I was happy to support a young local business as I too have a young local business, and strongly believe in supporting young entrepreneurs and craftsmen.   Fast forward to January, when I called to have my shoes picked up, as Patinas had transitioned into a mobile service. Alexander came to my house at 8am to pick up my shoes that needed repair; five pairs (4 heels, one pair of flats). He requested I pay upfront, being that it was early in the morning, we had numerous mutual contacts, and he is a young business with hesitation agreed. Thankfully I wrote a check tragically it was for nearly $250. What I was told I was buying was a six pair sole and heel package, the remaining pair I could call in at any time. A receipt would be emailed to me, and my shoes would be done in 10-14 days. 10 days later I call to inquire about my shoes, they are not ready. Day 14, I get voicemail. Day 20 I get hung up on. This persisted. I sent emails, Facebook messages, texts. I get no response.   Eventually I get a weird and vague communication from Alexander's \""\""assistant\""\"". Nothing is resolved, and then I am blocked from any means of contacting the business and its owner.   In March 3 months later I run into Alexander, we have a hostile and rude exchange. He proceeded to call me a peon and other nasty names, denying having my shoes. In April I see this individual at another event, he laughs as I walk away knowing good and well what is up. Literally as I am prepping to sue this questionable character calls, yep I was that upset he calls and claims there was a mix up, he indeed has my shoes and will drop them off later that day. I give him my work address via a text and email. No response.   He shows up the next morning, doesn't say a word and shows me the 4 heels he has repaired. The work is not bad, I have had much better work done elsewhere without the drama. I inquire about my gold flats, give a description and am told he would look for them, No apology, no explanation given, nothing.   I get an email asking for the shoes to be described, which I find odd considering that I just did this, and that I would get an apology letter later in the day. In my response I suggest a refund, my other shoes found/returned or replaced, only to be answered with \""\""I never had your flats, and a link to his website. No apology, no receipt.   Funny, he doesn't have my flats like he didn't have my shoes, like he did not remember who I was in March before he decided I was all these terrible random things, and cursed me out.   The lies, deception and utter disregard for customer service and human decency is too much.  I responded professionally requesting a refund, shoes replacement, receipt, and apology. I got zero response.   This whole exchange was really frustrating, and unprofessional. At this point I am out a pair of flats, it's not the end of the world but it is disappointing. It's unfortunate that someone feels entitled to treat others in this fashion, to deceive and steal.  While I am elated that I have my heels back, the reality the work Bourne did was mediocre and his customer service is HORRIBLE! I will chalk this up as a lesson to be careful who I choose to do business with. Research everyone, and do not use Alexander Bourne or Patina Shoe Parlor for ANY  service. You will be disappointed, ripped off and or treated poorly.

To top off the marginal food, it took almost 40 minutes to come once we ordered it.   Do yourself a favor and choose about place...you'll be much happier."", ""I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. Their biggest mistake is not having a customer service department. They rely on their sales team to provide customer service meaning every time you call in to try and get something done, you get put into a voicemail because the sales guy is out selling - which should be their only job. This left me on numerous occassions incredibly frustrated that I could not get an answer. I even left the manager a voicemail (big surprise I couldn't get them to answer) and they never had the decency to call me back - Just made my sales person call me back.  I purchased my car last July and was promised numerous things would be done to the car before I purchased it. One of which being the tint on the rear window would be removed as the view out of the back was blurry. Somehow, that passed thru inspection and when I came to sign the papers, I noticed that it was still on the back windshield. I was told that they would have it removed by the time we were done the paperwork. Also, I was told that the price was going to be higher than the original agreement because the sales manager did the math wrong the previous day when we ran numbers. I told him that wasn't my fault and I would only pay the agreed upon amount and he spoke with the manager and got it sorted out.   After sitting in the office for 2.5 hours, they finally told me that they were unable to even start taking off the tint and I would have to bring the car back. I dropped it off that Friday and let them keep it for the weekend. My sales guy called me on Saturday night to tell me that they never got to finish it and I would have to bring it back again and leave it. I live 45 minutes from the dealership so this isn't something I can easily do. I insisted on them giving me a loaner car for whatever day they would do this as I was sure this wouldn't be a one day process from my previous experience. 2.5 weeks later they were able to provide me with said car and I dropped off my vehicle. When I went to pick up my \""\""finished car\""\"" there was still tint left on the bottom of the windshield.   After all of that I knew I would never bring my car back for service there if that's the kind of service they provide. Now with all the rain we've been having, my trunk is leaking and when I called to check with the service department to see if it would be covered under warranty, I got the same run around with the service department who just said \""\""I don't know\""\"" - OK well give me someone who will be able to tell me. Once they forwarded me to the correct person, I again got \""\""I don't know\""\"". We need you to bring it in and look at it then submit to our warranty company to see if it gets accepted. No thanks after my previous experience of bringing my car in there to get \""\""serviced\""\"".   Invest in a customer service department to handle complaints in a professional and timely matter. This should not in any way be left upon the sales department to do. My sales guy did the best he could and I appreciated the help he gave me, but no one else would help me throughout the entire process. Not a good look on managements part."", ""The gelato may be very good, but I can't remember after such a negative dining experience.  With the exception of one person (the owner?) the staff were pretty missable.  Not a single smile to be had.  I don't expect my behind kissed, or even small talk, but I don't expect to give business to an establishment that hires people who seem bothered to be there.  There are three tables inside with ample room for a few more---not very family friendly.  Me, hubs and three children under 3 waited patiently for a table.  The icing on the cake was other customers---a lady practically climbed over my daughter to grab my hubs' seat when he got up to use the bathroom.  Seriously.  Not the establishment's fault, but all around poor attitude and rudeness abounded.  We won't be returning.  If you have children, pass on this place and enjoy ice cream at home."", ""I would give this place negative stars if possible... and I would like to know when people actually went here!? Where were the short lines? The brilliant employees who made jokes and whimsically processed your organized paperwork? Where were the birds singing merrily?   1. There are never any parking spaces in the small parking lot.  2. The people here are the rudest people I have ever come across, and that factors in for the fact that they have to work at the DMV and deal with idiots all day  Let's see --first visit the person at the front desk turned me away because I didn't know you needed to bring a personal check or money order and wouldn't even let me get a number if didn't show her I had all my documents were ready to be processed- well I thought,  ok the website doesn't say you only take checks but OK, this is my fault and they mean business here!   Second visit I was told the wait was 2 hours - they are only open during the hours I work 8:30-4:30 so basically you have to miss work to go to the location in South Philly. I had to go back to work so I, yet again, assumed it was on me to figure out how to do this the right way. I'll try again, I told myself.  Third visit I was prepared - I had all my paperwork--took 2 hours off work- and I was told the wait was 1 hour 23 minutes. I'm going to do this!! I was number 748 and they were on number 730 when I sat down. Score! Over an hour later, the TWO people working there had only gotten through 4 people. One woman spent the whole time waiting on the same person who looked like he handed her a paperclip and a plastic bag and she made all kinds of calls to try to get his documentation (remember I can't even get in the building without showing mine)... the other person working there, while he was moving at a faster pace, took 2 people in a row who didn't have numbers. Then a man came over and said \""\""My sister so and so is coming\""\"" and the woman nodded. 15 minutes later, the line hadn't moved at all and just before the man called the next number (number 735- still nowhere near me ) a woman comes up and announces she is so and so's sister and with no number, no line, no waiting, gets to go and give her paperwork in and was promptly waited on. Now, after 90 minutes and the line only moving 5 people my patience was wearing very thin. I complained about what was going on and I was told that \""\""oh honey those people were here earlier and lost their numbers\""\"" OH YEA RIGHT. Then the woman finishes with \""\""paperclip no documents man\""\"" and announces she is \""\""going on break\""\"" and gets up and walks around and starts playing with so and so's sister's baby while she gets waiting on and the rest of us sit there like total fools.   I left and will never go back. If you no choice but to go to this location, take a day off work and get there as soon as they open. Also know that your number means nothing and the wait will be over 2 hours. And no one will be nice. Or try and make friends with someone who works there and that way you don't even need a number.""]",5
82,"[""I absolutely love this restaurant.  Having been to many Indian restaurants in New England this was definetly a cut above.  Doing the tourist thing at Valley Forge and Philadelphia we came upon this restaurant by chance.  Our entrees were great and the Indian bread sampler was delicious.  We had enough left over for breakfast the next morning and had leftover bread for lunch that day.  We were so impressed we made a special trip back out to King of Prussia to eat again that night.  The owner of the restaurant was extremely nice and took a genuine interest in his customers."", ""Amazing Creamery -- a great selection of flavors!   I sampled a variety of flavors before I had to make the tough decision of choosing which ones to eat! My friends ended getting the awesome sampler scoops (4 flavors for $5 or 6 flavors for $7) and was able to try so many flavors! I ended up with two delicious flavors -- Red Velvet and Strawberry Sangria in a waffle cone!   The decor was super cute-- chalk boards with flavors written on there in a colorful fashion, and hand made drawings were dangled about. The fill of fresh made waffle cones also permeated the air, really riles up the sweet tooth in a person. (;  Noteworthy flavors: - Creole Cream cheese (cheesy vanilla goodness) - Champagne Violet (really good vanilla flavor with a hint of floral) - Red Velvet (cream cheese goodness with chunks of red velvet cake throughout) - Strawberry Sangria (fresh strawberry taste in sorbet form) - Pop (tastes like strawberry cream soda!)"", ""Needed to find a place to dine with my folks and my aunt and uncle inside the, \""\""Inside\""\"" strip (E, SL, CC), so I picked this place as most restaurants you pay close to the same price for 1 dish as you can for AYCE, and tonight was seafood night $25.95, and $3 discount for locals w/ proper ID.   I ate at this restaurant many years ago when it first opened and it was not impressive, which was strange as we used to dine in the old buffet which was across from this one, and that was always 4 to 5 stars.   I didn't eat here for a long time, then heard it was good again, tried it and agreed. I ate here 2 more times and both times were 4-5 stars, that is if you got the dishes that always look the best and the ones you like.  Tonight really was impressive, we were quickly sat, and served, I went out to get a plate and saw the mushroom ravioli and decide to load up, I got about 8 to 10 of them, and most places that would be all you get for $18 (probably a couple less raviolis too), but then I added tortellini, a small serving of lasagna, a loaded baked potato, fresh medium rare prime, and grabbed my seat. Everything was 5 stars, even the potato was excellent!   I was sufficiently stuffed, but it's kind of pricey, so you got to dig in and go for the uncomfortable stomach for a couple hours, so I grabbed another plate, and loaded up crab legs, mussels, and peel and eat shrimp. Again, all 5 star dishes. I was very shocked to have so many different dishes on such a high level!   Service was great, all plates quickly cleared, server was available anytime for drinks, napkins, etc.   Last I did desert, I again went for a belly buster consisting of cheesecake, butter finger something, flan, and mint chocolate chip gelato. The gelato was the star of this show, with everything else being delicious. Glad to see an old favorite come back to life and deliver an outstanding meal for my party of 5 with the greatest of ease!"", ""Went back with my mom because I couldn't think of better competition at the time. She's much more keen to detail, specifically cleanliness. We took our food to go as she was jaw dropped at how unkept this place is. Also worth mentioning is that over my MANY drop ins for a quick coffee, the coffee counter has never once been fully stocked. Too many one star visits. Was great in comparison to the one up Easton road that closed. Now is just gross."", ""This place has the best sushi/sashimi I've ever had.  I've been here a few times while visiting family, and it is always one of the highlights of the trips.  Simon makes tasty, flavorful rolls that are artistically presented.  The Green Dragon Roll is my favorites - it's so cute AND tasty!  I don't know what he does to his avocados, but they are creamy and delicious.  His rolls are well balanced, never too much rice, and from what I can tell, the fish is high quality.  He also makes very creative appetizers, a different one each time I've been there. One of my favorites is the Tuna Shumai - like butter!  It's a play on traditional shumai with tuna instead of a dumpling wrapper.  In short, this place is awesome."", ""OK, I have to confess, Jimboy's tacos are about as greesy as it gets, probably as bad for you as it gets, but they are my guilty pleasure.  I love them!  It's true love.  I can't help it.  It's a relationship that started back in high school when I used to get brain-dead-stoned after school and then go to Jimboys to eat all the tacos I could stuff down my throat. There is something about the greesy meat and cheese with the shell that's covered in parmasean cheese; it's soooo incredible.  It's my \""\""White Castle.\""\""  I no longer indulge in the Ganja substance abuse beforehand, but the tacos are almost as good without it."", ""Cozy place on charter street. My burger was phenomenal!,  I went with a group of 6 and everyone loved there food and it was fairly priced. Very clean bar, great decor. The bartender was very nice and friendly.  Great place."", ""This is an East Nashville mainstay.  They have an authentic Boston-style fish & chips that is excellent.  Also poor a great Guinness!"", ""I have enjoyed this spot for several years and it has always been 5 star. The staff is always friendly and the sushi always fresh. It is small and quaint,  a nice get away."", ""Food was awesome! Ordered the shrimp cocktail, sauce is HOT so beware! But the shrimp was fresh and perfect! Ordered the filet sliders and fresh homemade chips. Perfect dinner at the bar! I will be back here again for a full filet and with my wife! This place will make an awesome date night. Love it!!!"", ""Totally in love with the platter for two. We ordered pork shoulder and arrachera beef, which were both perfectly cooked! The cauliflower side was really good as well. Love the sauce on the side, btw. As for dessert, we ordered churros which was perfect for sharing! Had a relaxing and fun night at the restaurant:)"", ""Steamed buns for the adults. Beef & Broccoli for the kids. Great service. Good for kids. Food holds up if you opt to take out. Our favorite to go spot."", ""I need Rehab, I need rehab! I order 2 original banana puddings on Uber eats every Weekend. It is consistently delicious! The best I've had thus far!"", ""The food was outstanding.  I got chicken tagine, with the delicious tender meat falling off the bone, and carrot salad, flavored with mint and cumin.  Service was good, and the inside of the restaurant is cheerful and well-lit.  Total cost was around $13."", ""Absolutely fabulous stay at the Loews hotel Philadelphia! The service was fantastic! Room was clean, had a great view. It was my boyfriend and i's anniversary and the hotel gave us champagne and chocolate covered strawberries at no extra charge!  My boyfriend spoke with concierge Kimmy and she made everything so special! They even put rose petals on our bed while we were out at dinner! Would definitely recommend to a friend and we will definitely be coming back to stay again!"", ""I recommend the Philly cheesesteak. No shortage of meat or cheese, the 12 inch will fill you up and the 6 inch is a hearty snack. Enjoy it with an ice cold ginger beer from the fridge and a cookie if you can handle it. You will most likely have your food served to you by a 90 year old man named paul or something."", ""Paragon BJJ and Kickboxing is hands-down an amazing gym.   I decided that my daily routine needed a little something extra to keep me motivated, while still getting in a great workout. I looked online for kickboxing classes in Santa Barbara and stumbled upon Paragon. After reading the various Yelp reviews, I decided to sign up for an orientation class, initially for the Kickboxing program. Sean Apperson, the co-owner of the gym, quickly responded to my email and worked around my full-time job to schedule a one on one class. I then expressed through email that I was also interested in the Jiu Jitsu program at Paragon, and he was extremely open to provide an introduction to both sports.  Let me start off by saying that I have no background in martial arts or wrestling. I am female who has stayed active my entire life, but starting a new sport with no previous experience can be very intimidating, especially when there are a lot of guys taking the classes. When I walked in my first day, Sean was in the midst of a training session and was rolling with a female purple belt.... it definitely intrigued me. Sean looked up from the mat and proceeded to introduce himself with a big smile on his face and right away I felt at ease. We started with an introduction class in Jiu Jitsu and my nervousness disappeared when I realized how Sean went out of his way to make sure that I was comfortable. He was extremely encouraging throughout the training, we worked on basic technique and even laughed when I made a fool of myself (which happened a lot that first day). When the introduction class was over, I was so excited that I had found a new sport and signed up to join the gym right away.  After that first orientation class, I continued to attend beginner classes with nerves about how the training would go and how other athletes would perceive me. However, those nerves quickly faded after building a friendship with my fellow classmates and instructors. Everyone at the gym is extremely welcoming, approachable, and willing to work with you regardless of your level of training. 'Family' is the word that comes to mind when I think of the athletes at the gym because there is a feeling of love and respect for each other, while still pushing each other to succeed. It's a great feeling when you walk into the gym and the instructors and other athletes greet you by name and have actual conversations with you.  Also, Paragon is a very clean facility. They have a huge mat space, boxing ring, weights, cardio machines.. and they have just expanded into a bigger space, which is very exciting!! The large mat space is great for the classes and the locker rooms are clean and tidy. The shower area may be nicer than my shower at home! It's open 7 days a week and they offer classes at different times throughout the day, so you can work around your schedule.  I am so glad I joined Paragon BJJ and Kickboxing. Not only have I embarked on a new lifestyle, but have met an amazing group of people who are inspiring and fun to be around. I would definitely recommend Paragon to anyone, don't hesitate and sign up!"", ""My husband and I tried CPK while out at the Super Bowl Village. It looked like there was a long wait but we were able to seated right away. Our server was super friendly and checked on us often but wasn't overbearing at all.

The shrimp app is really good and the burger is one of the best I have ever had."", ""My family has been customers of George's for years. You pay for what you get. The quality of the food is premier and they don't hold back on portion size. Their cheesesteaks are amazing (chopped steak) and their chicken cheesesteaks are made from the same chicken as their Char platters, which is legit. Their Char platters come with some of the best and juciest grilled chicken I've ever had. They make their own sauce, so just that alone puts their wings above the other restaurants in the neighborhood that just use Franks Red Hot. I have yet to have something on their menu that I didn't like."", ""Don't bother to place an order in person.  With no other customers in the store I had to wait over five mins just before the guy would slowly walk around to the cash register to say, \""\""you didn't call it in\""\"".

I cannot believe this is the cheap theater. It is so nice! The screens are big, the sound and lighting and chairs and everything is just what it should be: comfortable, clean, and nice. I have been to many cheap theaters in my life and this is by far the best. I just wish it was closer to me! The Oracle cheap theater is closer to me, but by a long shot, this one is better. If it was closer I would go to movies all the time!   Another plus, everyone there is friendly and the parking lot is huge.

The tacos were just as good, but sadly they no longer offer the combo (one of each kind of taco, chicken, beef, and pork). We spoke with the manager (I'm assuming) several times. She made it a priority to speak with all of the customers. The food here is definitely too notch. My only criticism is that our food was slow coming out. Our server was nice enough to inform us that an appetizer was not going to be ready until near when our entrees would be so we just cancelled it. Overall a great experience and worth the try.

We also ordered 20 piece wings but when it came out, there was only 19 pieces. (Not that we intentionally counted but there was 5 of us And we agreed everyone was going to get 4 each, equaling 20) We brought it to our servers attention who disappeared for long periods of a time. It seemed like we always had to look around to try to find him and flag him down. It was very annoying, the server to the table next to us was more attentive to his table than ours was to ours. 15 mins gone by after we told him, still nothing. Finally he came back and by this time we just wanted our check. When we recieved our check we were still charged full price for the wings. Whatever, it's just 1 wing but the more we thought about it the more we got upset because it seemed as tho they didn't care about customer service much. We seemed like a joke to them complaining about a missing wing. My bf flagged down the manager and when we brought it to his attention, he basically blew us off and said \""\""I'll take off a dollar for you.\""\"" Now that was insulting. Then out of nowhere our server came over with a plate with just 1 wing on it since he seen us looking for the manager. We don't give a daym about the wing. This is poor customer service. If we would have went anywhere else, they would have apologized for the mistake which we all would have understood, it happens. Then asked us if we needed anything and immediately replaced what was missing and on top of that added some more. Now that's customer service. For what they did, we will not becoming back ever again.

It's also not that expensive - only about $10 /platter and it comes with two sides and cornbread... and if you don't like cornbread you can swap it for another side.

It is not just a tourist trap, even though you can find it at the end of the SB pier past all the other tourists traps. Love to get the rock crab deal ($25 for a 2-3lb rock crab with onion rings)   My favorite moment:  I will never forget the day we tried their California King crab for the first time. It was a weekend when all my girls came back to town and we had gone kayaking/ S.U.P. (With paddle sports from the Harbor area) and we had made plans to grab an early dinner from the shellfish co. While on the water we saw them pulling up fresh cali kings from the side of the pier. After our hour on the ocean, we were famished but still aware that it could be a wait since the place is small and popular. Luckily since it was early (before 5pm dinner rush) we were seated quickly. The server recommended the cali kings, said we wouldnt regret it because they were really fresh. We looked over and there they were! Being dumped into the tanks. They were kicking and trying to climb out.   Priced at $17.95 per lb, they came anywhere between 1.5 to 3 lbs. I went for a 2pounder. That first succulent bite was heaven. And I mean, damn that is one buttery heaven. Each morsel was so large, so sweet..all of my girls and I were silent, with glistening eyeballs staring at each other.   After that day, I couldn't get that crab out of my mind. Any chance I could I wanted to go back before the season was over.  But be careful, a 3 pounder means you're eating a $75 crab. Only negative is that you can only choose between soup or salad. For that price..I should've gotten both. It's okay, just add a $1 and you can both i guess.   Besides the crab, the oysters are always good and I highly recommend the uni appetizer.   Okay I really recommend the uni appetizer. I usually buy my own uni fresh and shuck it at home, but these they place on top of a fresh scallop on top of a lime pinwheel with a side of ponzu. It's so fresh and clean, that they leave the empty uni shell as a center piece with its spines still wiggling."", ""I should have read the reviews before going here.

And heaven forbid you need to take a bathroom break, or need a beverage! You don't get to PAUSE your time for ANYTHING. They didn't even have a server, so if you're hoping to have a couple beers, better get ready to run quick and get them yourself. The lane even malfunctioned a couple times, but there's no time to wait for a service worker to fix it, because they don't bother extending the time you've lost.

This hotel fails to get the simple things right and when you fail at that everything else is secondary.   Customer experience: Phase two of the customer experience was the beginning of the issues. There was no clear signage to direct you to the valet when we arrived at 10:30 pm which caused me to circle the block to make another pass and find it.   Phase three the AC system is not adequate at all to cool the room, I set the thermostat to 65 degrees in the living room and the bedroom was still hot and not just for me but my girlfriend as well. The curtains do not block out the sun as they don't close all the way. So instead of a nice long sleep I can't sleep with the heat then the sun bright in early through the window wakes us up.   At this point I got up to take a shower which is one with the horrible cheap shower curtains that divide halfway up. I got the shower curtain with the one half inside the shower and the other half outside. When I finished the shower the floor was soaked. It's annoying because I specifically took the time to get that stupid cheap shower curtain setup right and it still leaked everywhere.   Hopefully they will buy real shower curtains, upgrade the AC, and fix the blinds so people can get a good rest but after this night I'm done with Embassy Suites Tampa.

The coffee was fine."", ""I always say that Indy has something for everybody, but saying that it has a place inside of 465 for mountain bikers to go enjoy their hobby is even something that surprises me. Fortunately, it's a true statement, and its access is completely free. This little park located south of 96th St. between Keystone and Allisonville is in an area normally associated with businesses and restaurants, but this wooded trail that runs along creeks and ponds is a nice way to escape that. Granted, you're still reminded of where you are when you hear the traffic on the interstate, but it sure beats biking anywhere else in the area.   The entrance to the park can be easy to miss, but it's a little gravel turn off of 96th St. just east of Hazel Dell. There is a small sign, but it's easy to miss on the busy street. Once you turn in, there is a nice large paved lot, a shelter house, lots of picnic tables, and a big information board about the trail. I've never been the only one at the park, and there are usually quite a few other people there either on the trail already or getting prepped. The information that is posted on their board is pretty helpful, so it would be a good idea to check that out.   The trail itself is maintained fantastically. It's only open during the day, and closes when it is too wet to ride without harming the trail, but it's one of the better mountain biking trails I've been on, although that's a short list. It's labeled as a beginner trail, and I think that's appropriate. It will give a beginner plenty of challenges without ever putting them too far out of their comfort zone. It's also fun for more advanced riders as it is a very fast and flowing trail that you can really fly though. The HMBA, who maintains the trail, has done a good job of putting splits in the trail that can take you to jumps, bridges, and drops if you want to hit those obstacles. The majority of the trail is through woods, with a little bit of it opening into a grassland type area. It's mostly a dirt trail, but there are some sections that get kind of rocky or have a lot of tree roots that make it fun. There aren't really any substantial hills, but there are plenty of short sharp inclines that mix things up. It's also a great place to see plenty of wildlife. I've seen quite a few deer out there and you can always hear squirrels and birds all around. A significant portion of the trail runs next to water, either in the form of a large creek or a pond, and as long as you don't end up in either of them, it makes for a nice scenic ride.  I think they say the trail is about 9 miles long. It's a single track trail that runs clockwise and everything is very clearly marked and distinguishable. At about the halfway point (when you are going under the interstate) you can turn around and catch the return part of the loop to cut the trip in half. While there are quite a few people that use it, I would never say it gets crowded. There are some good riders that make it out here, so if you are slower than someone coming up behind you there are plenty of places to pull aside and just wait to let them pass you so you never feel pressured to push yourself faster than the pace that you want.   A quick note for those who decide they want to hike or trail run here; it is one of the few trails in which bikers actually have the right of way, so be careful and respectful.  A huge thanks to all the HMBA members and volunteers who keep this trail in perfect condition."", ""Weird location...looks like somebody's house..ancient equipment just like the workers.

Pros: Lovely environment with pretty lights, numerous heating lamps, indoor seating area to get snacks and hot chocolate, pricing reasonable.   Cons: Rentals are hockey skates and not figure skates and weren't in the greatest of shape. Rink is pretty small for the amount of people they let on. Poorly tended ice - we got on right after they 'cleaned it up' and it was rough and choppy and the worst areas were the perimeter where inexperienced skaters would need smoother ice the most.   Staff was hit or miss. Some were very friendly and helpful and others were glum and ignored you. I got the impression we weren't the only unhappy patrons, as several people were also returning their skates and as mentioned the session had just begun.""]",3

The shrimp and scallops pasta was awful - small shrimps and scallops, definitely not fresh.  It was also sour, either from some wrong ingredient or some overdue sauce."", ""This place is terrible.

They asked me how spicy I wanted it and I responded that I wanted it spicy.  I did not expect that the entire bowl of soup would be covered in red pepper flakes.  Disgusting. I spent ten minutes picking red pepper flakes out of the soup and my mouth.      I also tried the chicken satay.  The chicken was ice cold and as dry as beef jerky. The dipping sauce was a mix between curry and Planter's honey roasted peanuts.  It was a bizarre combination like nothing I've ever had before.  Once again...Disgusting.     Finally, I ordered curry.  I had high hopes that they could not screw up everything in my order.  Boy was I wrong.  The curry was bland and just plain gross.

I like how it has been decorated on the inside - definitely unique compared to the other Reno casinos.  Again, we simply came to play at the Poker room.  They have quite a few games going.  You can probably find a game that you want to play in.  In fact, when we went on Memorial weekend, there was a game behind me going for $25/50 NL.  The people had stacks of 100s on the table.  Really exciting to be in the same room as high rollers.  All in all, this is probably my favorite casino to go to in Reno.

I hate when it's not dark enough and people sit at the bars and just stare en masse at the two people dancing. With those standards in mind, here is my club hierarchy:  Space: Greg's has a better dance floor than the metro, casba and the melody inn, but is about equal to Talbott's. Talbott's dance floor is bigger, but Greg's is darker and there is far less \""\""parking on the dance floor,\""\"" if you will.   Music: Greg's plays better music than Talbott (with exception of some rare talents that pass through the side room, but the dance floor in the side room is no good), the melody inn is kind of a mixed bag for the electronic shows, casba has pretty solid music as does metro.

There is no NON-Smoking sign anywhere to be seen, and every other room on our hallway is a smoking room.  To add insult, the front desk tried to argue that hotels are not required to have NON-Smoking signs designating whether the room is or isn't non-smoking.

Let me preface that my husband and his family know him from many years of working in Chinatown and we've always helped support his business. To make a long story short: I booked a birthday party for 7:00. The family came early to set up, as he said it was allowed. At 6:30 he came in yelling that we have to leave at 9:00 because he has someone coming in and we can't stay there all night.

They might want to rethink their desk staff if they want to appear welcoming and friendly."", ""I'm not sure what changed over the last year at this restaurant, but now it's just terrible food. Before, when I first started coming, it was decent: nothing fancy, but filling and palatable. Now, though, the food is disgusting. 90% of their buffet offerings are WAY too salty. The pulled turkey was tough, the fish tasted like licking a bottle of meat tenderizer, and the vegetables cooked to a putty-like state. The only thing vaguely edible was the corn pudding and mashed potatoes. The desserts are ok, almost store-bought quality.   The service at least was good. Our waitress refilled our drinks promptly and removed plates often. The only good I saw all night."", ""I expected to go there, try the veggie burger and leave without giving it that much thought.  It turns out a place that sells a lot of beef might become the new vegan hot spot of Philadelphia.  They label their menu which shows they are attuned to the concerns of vegans. So they meet the bare minimum. Good thing they surpass it.  For starters, get the pickles and slaw \""\""bare snack\""\"". Two kinds of vegan slaw. The whole thing is fantastic. It made the perfect sharing item for a party of three.  They also have so many toppings and sides that are vegan. The vegan sandwiches they offer can be modified to add these items such as chickpea onions and stout onions.   My wife and I split two vegan sandwiches, Guadalupe burger and the Mazuma tempeh sandwich. Both were great. I especially appreciate that they make their own veggie burger. No Morningstar Farms here.  For dessert we had the vegan carrot cake. The only item we ate that we didn't love. I would skip it net time.  Seriously, the meal I just had there compares very favorable to the many great all-vegan restaurants in Philadelphia. I am very very impressed."", ""While friendly enough, too many mistakes were made for me to ignore. First, I didn't receive my soda, and had to go get my waiter and ask him for it again. Not too big a deal, but then my daughter's chicken enchilada...had no chicken. We'd already begun eating, and our waiter hadn't come around to see if everything was OK. I asked her if she wanted to send it back but she said no, so, fine. The food itself was OK. We were hungry, we ate it. Her kid's meal was around $6.50, my crispy tacos $7.50, and my soda was $2. I noticed the prices on the menu, but wasn't adding up my bill ahead of time or anything because that's, you know, the restaurant's job. So I didn't blink when a check totaling $22.51 came, and I didn't pay any mind about tipping %20 (despite the faults, I've been a server before, so I can understand). In the end I paid $28. It was after we were long gone that I realized the total Should have been closer to $16, not $22.51. Did I get the wrong check and not notice? Did they add gratuity to a teeny little party of two without even telling me? Either way, that's a big no-no, right?  I wasn't being on my toes I guess, but I still feel a little ripped off. Ultimately they received more money than I personally thought the whole experience was worth, hence my poor star rating.

91,"[""As much as I adore food I am, typically, pretty easy when it comes to food and I forgive a lot. SO...one star means a lot! I haven't been as livid as I was leaving this fiasco of a restaurant in a long while. Reasons:  The server was on her cell phone from the minute we walked in to the minute we walked out (about 90 minutes). She literally had it on her shoulder the entire time except to say, \""\""Please hold\""\"" to take our orders. She was also the chef and cooked while talking on her bloody phone, as well. Service:  FAIL. My pork leg was tender and good which constitutes the lonely little star you see above. My husband ordered the shrimp, which cost $18.99. He received 7 shrimp that would be in a bag of 31-35 count...the size worthy of a salad shrimp. Again, $18.99...and the plantain portion of the meal consisted of 2 plantains the width of a postage stamp. Ridiculous. I then ordered tostones because I knew he would never be full with that quantity of food. I had to get up and find our server to add to my order as she was nowhere to be found.  They were also ridiculously thin, were over salted with an almost breaded and deep fried consistency. Food:  FAIL. I was going to order a Cuban coffee but the server was so non-existent that I just gave up, finally.  In retrospect, I'm happy I didn't order it because I'm sure it would have been just wrong. I would not frequent this restaurant again even if I had a free coupon. Don't waste your time or energy."", ""Came here for brunch at 1 on a Saturday while visiting from out of town. Drinks are good but come out slow and it took over an hour to bring out our appetizer The service is really slow. Our server seemed very overwhelmed but the restaurant wasn't even packed. On a Saturday afternoon with nice weather there should probably be more servers working. Tables are left messy and we actually had to wipe the food off of our table ourselves.  I ordered the steak and eggs and when I asked our server if the eggs could be prepared over easy instead of scrambled, she said she didn't know because they pre scramble the eggs in the morning...  When our food came out it was atrocious. I am appalled that the kitchen would even send it out in the state that it was. 1 burger had an eggshell on it and the other had cold congealed cheese and the bun was twice the size of he burger. The steak and eggs were the size of a side. And the eggs were scrambled...  Advice to management- hire bussers and greet people as they walk in... It's not always obvious when you should seat yourself. Also isn't fair for servers to have to have to apologize for management and kitchen staff not doing their jobs right.  After all was said and done, management gave us $10 gift cards which didn't even cover the cost of our drinks and even our server said 'this is bullshit'."", ""****Beware**** the employees are totally rude after the vaccum my vehicle sat for at least 10 mins running before anyone took it to spray off to enter the automatic wash so I had told the manager/owner ?

Mistake. As soon as I walked in the manager made an offensive comment about my appearance (I have long hair and a beard so she referred to me as \""\""baby Jesus\""\"") Not a good start.  Food quality was very poor even for a buffet, and the stock was extremely low on everything, and what was there was cold and unpleasant. Drinks never were refilled.   I tried to salt my food and discovered not one, but all salt shakers were caked with water and unfunctional. When I asked the server for fresh salt she proceeded to check the tables and came back several minutes later with what she claimed was \""\""the best she could find\""\"" rather than making a fresh bottle, and it was just as caked as the others.   If I had to say one positive thing about it, I'd say that I'm 90% positive that the steak was made from actual beef!   Do yourself a favor and never go here."", ""Worse place and sandwich.

The person I talked to on the phone seemed to be in a rush but seemed to have gotten all of my information even asking if I was okay with a male and female masseuse. When I went to spell out my name I got a quick \""\""okay okay\""\"" mid sentence. No big deal. Today when my boyfriend and I got there twenty minutes early for a massage we saw a busy fully booked very busy business. We sat there for probably 5 to 10 minutes before being acknowledged. Still not a big deal they were busy and that's why we got there early for things like this. After the guy got our name he looked at the appointments list repeatedly trying to find our names or numbers he simply said we weren't on the books. There was nothing he could do they were fully booked for the day and then he proceeded to ask me who I spoke to on the phone did she sound Vietnamese because that was the owner she does that all the time to people. She takes there appointment and never writes it down! This was the most ridiculous thing that I have ever heard of. We asked when the owner would be in and he said she was there. Then we asked well won't she do something about this and he just flat out said no. The second most ridiculous thing that I have ever heard. We left at that point. Needless to say I was pissed at this point no massage for us. Birthday ruined.

I was really impressed with the taste of the burgers and fries at Five Guys. They stand head and shoulders above other fast food joints in Edmonton (and area).   I went to In 'N' Out when I was in Vegas, loved it, and was talking to a friend about wishing we had them here. She said the closest thing was Five Guys, and she was right!  I went on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm, and it was busier than I expected it to be. There seemed to be a little bit of organized chaos going on behind the counter, but they must have their system down. Our food came pretty quickly.  Now, all the burgers come with two patties as the standard, so if you only want one, order the 'little (burger name)'. I had a little bacon burger, my husband had a regular sized bacon burger, we and shared large cajun fries - everything came to $18. Holy moly, yum. Just delicious. Kind of indescribable, actually, which is a little funny for a fast food burger. It was just so fresh and juicy and actually tasted like something, rather than a slab of cardboard with ketchup on it. The cajun fries were nice, too, although I still want to try the regular fries sometime. Even though I got a little burger, I still couldn't finish it!  I wish there was a Five Guys in Edmonton, but for now I'll have to settle for hitting this one up when I'm in ShPk.

We had the onion tarte and brussel sprouts to share and I had the Grilled Mahi. Honestly the descriptions on the menu don't even serve the food justice. Mahi with caper butter? Sounds rather ordinary. But no that's where you'd be wrong. It was so good I actually wiped my clean, which I NEVER do. It was served with kale, but not regular kale salad. These were more like spiced kale chips. I was like HOW DO I MAKE THESE AT HOME??? I wanted a bag to take with me just so I could snack on them.  The birthday cake was a little piece of chocolatey heaven. I'm not sure what it was but it tasted like flourless chocolate cake with ice cream. It was super moist and dense.

Seriously I am not going to go into you have been warned just yuk...OK? these other folks with the positive reviews for this place must burn off their taste buds with adult beverages.

Here is something I am not sure of, I have only lived here a few months now, is it customary to charge for each soda every time you get a refill here? I was charged for each I asked why they said \""\""This is how we do it here.\""\"" So at $2 bucks per 6-8 ounces of beverage you may want to go with water at this place...but smarter yet!

I needed the car back the next morning, but Miguel assured me it would be done by the time they opened, at 10am.   I called on Sunday at 10:30, and not only had the inspection not been done yet, \""\""they guy who does inspections didn't come in this morning.\""\"" So I went and took the car back, no inspection competed.

It was a 2013. That basically meant they had thoroughly inspected the car.  When I test drove the car I did not notice the small crack in the window and scratches on the passenger side.  Their inspection said no cracks, chips etc.  That was my first clue I had made a mistake.  After I arrived home I looked at the financing.  I was charged a fee to get a better interest rate. The finance person also convinced me to get a protection package I had already told the sales person I did not want.  He had already put the package into the price on the paperwork.  The car had a Sonic price of 16900.  I put 6 thousand down and still owed over 16,000 on the car at 5 % interest for 72 months.  I could have bought a new car for that price.

We decided to walk to have breakfast in Surrey, which we found on Yelp. It was a highly recommended local breakfast place. Located far from the touristy French quarters, it's a small shack-dive beloved by locals and tourists as the best in local cuisine. Even before we got there, we saw a crowd of people waiting outside. The wait for a table was 30 minutes so we felt lucky and elated to sit at the bar. We got a watermelon and jicama salad and a crabmeat omelet. I was disappointment from the first bite. The omelet was soooo rich, like it was made with cream and butter and more butter-cream on top; it made me nauseous. The salad was so plain, it felt like a joke, a few pieces of watermelon on ripped up leaves of bibb lettuce  covered with black pepper. I needed to eat something and asked for a garden salad with a poached egg. It was a poor showing with some mixed greens, a pathetically thin slice of tomato, a few cubes of huge cucumbers used for juicing and a balsamic vinaigrette mixed by finger right in front of me. The place is a tiny shack, should be filled with lovingly prepared local cuisine. It is NOT. The food, as well as the service and the ambiance are a poor showing, more hype than substance. The supposedly organic fresh juices, at $7 a pop, are not squeezed to order but poured from containers from the fridge. Freshly squeezed should be freshly squeezed. They refused to give us water with ice. How can you not give people water when its so unbearable hot outside? We paid more for our breakfast than a top French restaurant in New York and I walked away hungry and disgusted."", ""I have had Pizza hut before at a different location and I don't remember the service ever being this horrible. We ordered delivery. They were late, we called them multiple times and the manager would not come to the phone except on the last try. When he finally spoke to us, he blamed us and said we didn't pick up the phone and that he left a voicemail. I immediately knew he was lying since   1. if he called us the multiple times he said we would have received the call 2. if he left a voicemail message THERE WOULD BE A VOICEMAIL MESSAGE  DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS LOCATION. THE MANAGER TRIES TO PLACE BLAME ON CUSTOMERS, LIES AND DOES NOT KNOW WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS!!"", ""Went there for brunch today. Unfortunately, the person assigned to the omelet station had no idea how to cook AND she was sooooooo slow.  She overcooked every omelet and could not handle a two burner station."", ""I would not recommend using Alexander Bourne or Patina Shoe Parlor for any service. This \""\""business man\""\"" is not who or what he claims to be. He is not nice, professional, or reliable. I am baffled at this man's success within the local community; all things come to the light eventually.   My personal headache with this I met the \""\""proprietor\""\"" out last summer, he was a nice enough guy, we had a bunch of mutual acquaintances. When he told me what he did, as shoe junkie I was happy to support a young local business as I too have a young local business, and strongly believe in supporting young entrepreneurs and craftsmen.   Fast forward to January, when I called to have my shoes picked up, as Patinas had transitioned into a mobile service. Alexander came to my house at 8am to pick up my shoes that needed repair; five pairs (4 heels, one pair of flats). He requested I pay upfront, being that it was early in the morning, we had numerous mutual contacts, and he is a young business with hesitation agreed. Thankfully I wrote a check tragically it was for nearly $250. What I was told I was buying was a six pair sole and heel package, the remaining pair I could call in at any time. A receipt would be emailed to me, and my shoes would be done in 10-14 days. 10 days later I call to inquire about my shoes, they are not ready. Day 14, I get voicemail. Day 20 I get hung up on. This persisted. I sent emails, Facebook messages, texts. I get no response.   Eventually I get a weird and vague communication from Alexander's \""\""assistant\""\"". Nothing is resolved, and then I am blocked from any means of contacting the business and its owner.   In March 3 months later I run into Alexander, we have a hostile and rude exchange. He proceeded to call me a peon and other nasty names, denying having my shoes. In April I see this individual at another event, he laughs as I walk away knowing good and well what is up. Literally as I am prepping to sue this questionable character calls, yep I was that upset he calls and claims there was a mix up, he indeed has my shoes and will drop them off later that day. I give him my work address via a text and email. No response.   He shows up the next morning, doesn't say a word and shows me the 4 heels he has repaired. The work is not bad, I have had much better work done elsewhere without the drama. I inquire about my gold flats, give a description and am told he would look for them, No apology, no explanation given, nothing.   I get an email asking for the shoes to be described, which I find odd considering that I just did this, and that I would get an apology letter later in the day. In my response I suggest a refund, my other shoes found/returned or replaced, only to be answered with \""\""I never had your flats, and a link to his website. No apology, no receipt.   Funny, he doesn't have my flats like he didn't have my shoes, like he did not remember who I was in March before he decided I was all these terrible random things, and cursed me out.   The lies, deception and utter disregard for customer service and human decency is too much.  I responded professionally requesting a refund, shoes replacement, receipt, and apology. I got zero response.   This whole exchange was really frustrating, and unprofessional. At this point I am out a pair of flats, it's not the end of the world but it is disappointing. It's unfortunate that someone feels entitled to treat others in this fashion, to deceive and steal.  While I am elated that I have my heels back, the reality the work Bourne did was mediocre and his customer service is HORRIBLE! I will chalk this up as a lesson to be careful who I choose to do business with. Research everyone, and do not use Alexander Bourne or Patina Shoe Parlor for ANY  service. You will be disappointed, ripped off and or treated poorly. Just go elsewhere and save yourself the trouble.""]",1

We were warned of possible waiting times so came here on a Saturday around 10:45, and a line was already forming!   For apps, we ordered the takoyaki and fried octopus. The takoyaki are delicious-an order comes with 5 balls that were perfectly cooked and topped with sauces. Takoyaki are little circular doughs with squid in the middle, topped with sauces and squid flakes (?). I definitely recommend this app. As for the fried octopus, it was just fried without sauces on top and came with mayo on the side, but it didn't come with enough mayo to dip the octopus in.  For ramen, I got the red spicy tonkotsu ramen and my SO got the black garlic tonkotsu ramen. For both ramen, the thin noodles were mushy/overcooked and just didn't quite fit with the ramen. That was the flaw with the dishes, and it tasted like the noodles were overcooked in a pot of flour-y water so it wasn't as clean (which explains the mushy feeling). They should use more bouncy noodles for this.  Now let's talk about the broth. The broth is flavorful, but the red chili broth was a bit too spicy for me and covered up the depth of the broth. I prefer the black garlic tonkotsu broth for that reason.  Overall, delicious food and pricing is reasonable. The decor is very nice as well, but screaming kids that were running around didn't make our meal pleasant."", ""I love this place! This past summer, I would go here almost every other day to buy a different kind of donut for my family to try. The atmosphere is great, service is great, and the food is amazing.

Dr. G was also a gem when helping us work through some less than typical situations that arose.  She made herself very available throughout the processes as we needed her.  That was incredibly appreciated during what is a very emotional process.  We ultimately had a successful pregnancy on the first try and had a baby within a year of our first visit to the clinic.

Our entrees were great, though. I had a lamb special, which was incredible, and my wife's pasta was also very good.   A couple weird things: 1) the space is a little small, to the point where the servers are tripping over each other; 2) the music choice was strange for an Italian place (mid-90s country) - I wasn't looking for Dean Martin or anything, but it was an odd choice."", ""This is an amazing place.

They also serve wings and other overpriced items like mac and cheese (mediocre) and pastries (meh).   The sauces are unique and probably the best part about this place as you won't be able to find sauces like this elsewhere. Be watchful of how full the sauce is because some of the containers are not completely full and you get jipped. Sadly you can't sample the sauces without having to buy them. My favorite is bar b q sauce. It has a slight acidic vinegar kick, but isn't bittersweet. Maybe they cut back on the sugar? The chipotle lime mayo is great. It isn't too creamy and oily. The chipotle is subtle, almost dull and a little bit more would make it better and bold. I found myself having to double dunk the chicken in this sauce to really taste it. You always finish it wishing you had a little more. I've tried almost all of them and none of them are too memorable that I can recall anything great or bad about the rest of the sauces.  The breading is thin and crisp, which I appreciate. With one bite you taste the breading and chicken, and not just breading on heavily breaded chicken that other places might serve. The breading can be over salty and seasoned too much. Don't mistake this for rich and intense. It is salty. I end up drinking a lot of water with this meal partially due to this. What makes the breading suck is that it is not always fresh. Who knows how long the chicken has been sitting out.  The meat can be hit or miss; the chicken can be a little parched. This is disappointing when you have a whole pound of chicken to consume that will leave your mouth dry and leave you bloated after you drink a lot to quench your thirst and high sodium intake. More often then not, I always get the dried, salty chicken instead of the juicy, tender chicken that I once got at my very first visit. Perhaps I am unlucky and get the left over stale pieces that have been sitting out long. I can only recall once when my chicken was tender and juicy when they first opened.I try to avoid wasting money here because I have not had the same type of meal since my first. However, out of desperation to try something different than the usual univ city food, I have eaten here a few times to make this review justified.  What my friends and I would like to do is split up and someone get french fries from Greek Lady and the others get chicken from Wishbone. We would satisfy our elementary palates by eating chicken fingers and french fries. If you are willing to walk a few more blocks, Allegros has really good curly fries but portions are a lot bigger when you eat at the place.  I would have given this place 1.5 stars for the food, but they once cancelled a chicken wing eating contest on my friends and me just hours prior to the event with poor explanation so I knock it down to 0.5 stars, but yelp doesn't have 0.5 increments."", ""This may actually be the worst falafel pita sandwich I have seen in my life.

Well, they were fantastic. And I'm not much of a pancake guy. Their fried eggs and sausage patties were both enjoyable as well."", ""I wish I could give zero stars to this poor excuse for a restaurant... On the way back from Philly to our beach house recently, my wife and I stopped in for a sandwich.  We were led to a nice booth and greeted by a young girl waitress.  My wife ordered a grilled cheese and asked for some DICED tomatoes in it.  The young waitress repeated the order back and said of course- no problem.  I ordered the veggie bean burger and she asked how would I like it cooked- which was odd, but I added \""\""medium please\""\"".  I ordered iced tea for my wife and me and added onion rings to my order.  A full 28 minutes later our sandwiches appeared.  My wife's order came with SLICED tomatoes- no biggie- and she just ate it anyway,  I attempted to bite my burger and  roll and nearly broke a tooth on the over-microwaved wheat roll. My wife laughed as the entire burger fell out onto the plate splattering ketchup and mustard on my polo shirt. 5 minutes later the waitress reappeared and I explained that perhaps something had gone awry in the kitchen and she quickly brought me a new roll.  This one was mostly frozen... so I told her never mind- I'll just eat the patty and tomato/lettuce.  The patty was cardboard but I ate it anyway... my wife was busy dabbing my shirt to remove the mustard/ketchup stains when the waitress came back to apologize that the cook was overwhelmed by a party in the next room. (Odd, since there were only 8 or 9 cars in the lot outside.)  She was very timid about offering the explanation and I just accepted it as not totally her fault but rather (I assumed) an intimidating short order cook in the back somewhere.  Upon leaving, I advised the floor manager at the register very quietly about the roll and she made a face and took off three dollars from the bill since \""\""you ate the burger part\""\""... with no apology or attempt at customer service. The waitress got her full tip.   I was so angry that I vowed to open a yelp account and DID!  Avoid this place at all costs."", ""I went to El Camino on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. When I got there we had to wait for a table so me and my date grabbed drinks from the bar. We ordered a pitcher of margarita.

She pretended to throw out the liquid in the pitcher and make another one . Instead she walked over to the other bar and just added ice to the pitcher her hair landed in .That was strike one of the afternoon. Then when we were finally seated I ordered the pancho nachos with chicken. They brought it out without the chicken. I tell the waiter. Instead of bring out a fresh nacho they bring out the chicken in a bowl. Service is poor and the quality of goods is not great either.

The crab cakes I remembered as delicious morsels of ambrosia turned out to be overly greasy, too little crab, and much too little taste. At least they were edible. The grilled snapper (fish of the day) and asparagus that I got on the side were overcooked and drowned in butter as if this could hide the unmistakable blandness of the food.

97,"[""I'm new to the area and was looking for a bikini wax for a weekend at the beach. Did my research (mostly yelp!) and scheduled an appointment. The building was impossible to find (in an office building with NO signs whatsoever or indication of the spa), and when I arrived the front desk staff was on the phone, busy, and had no time for me. She checked my name in and told me to sit down, then walked away before I could ask where the waiting area was.   The wax was the worst wax I've ever had - and I've been waxing for years. Erica didn't double-dip the sticks, but used the paper strips over and over, which I found unsettling. The conversation was fine, she was pleasant enough but did a terrible job. This next part is a bit ahem, graphic, so first-time waxers beware...   Compared to other aestheticians that take their time and position your legs in various positions to get the best possible view and angle for waxing, she simply had me open one leg at a time and waxed the entire area like that. This was much more painful, as each area was not pulled taut when she waxed, and resulted in an unsightly (not to mention painful) bruise in my nether regions. The rest of the area was red for hours longer than it usually is.  Then, when I went to pay, the girls behind the desk were *again* on the phone/talking/too busy to talk to me. After a while, I finally got someone's attention, but while I was her asking a question, the phone rang. Without so much as asking me to hold on, she answered it, began talking, and walked away. I signed my credit card receipt and stood there awkwardly, alone, wondering if I was finished. Finally, when they noticed me, I asked if I was done. The woman said yes and just waved me away.   I escorted myself out, feeling dismissed and completely unimportant. Although the spa is very nice and high-end, I got the impression they cater preferentially to more wealthy clientele, and regular people like me were just dismissed without a thought."", ""Below average Chinese food priced accordingly.

We finished our drinks and promptly left."", ""While the Brunchies in Tampa is an amazing place, this was a horrible experience. The restaurant is so crowded the staff can hardly move between the tables. It took well over an hour to get our food so we didn't eat until noon and our server never came by the table to check on us during that time. I can only write about my food but the hollandaise sauce was not hollandaise but some loose, broken sauce - It was more like melted butter than anything. Half the table hated their food and the other half liked it. I will NEVER come here again, instead I will head to Tampa or go to Kikis for breakfast."", ""I had a really fun girls night. I'm a big fan of the drink bowls for $25 and what a great idea that they give different color straws so you know what straw belongs to those in your group.

We would definitely eat here again. Apparently a lot of people come here for Birthday breakfasts as there were three times when staff came out clapping singing Happy Birthday.

As another reviewer noted, they are Deva cut professionals and are trained to cut curly hair. The work is thoughtful, thorough, and artful-I get compliments on both my color and cut.

We sat at the bar and had the deep fried buttermilk quail app. It was so delicious I wanted another. We were not convinced we were going to stay for dinner until the last bite of the quail changed our minds.  We both had the prixe fixe menu with wine pairing and ordered one of each of the choices. The grits souffle was DECADENT!!!!! I cannot begun to describe the flavor! Our dinners were superior. The filet was cooked perfectly and the chicken was heavenly and moist. The gnocchi side dish was light, flavorful and amazing. Whoever cooked it should be teaching chefs across the country.  Desserts came next. The panna cotta was rather unremarkable but the rocky road terrine left us fighting for the last bite.  Food temperature is important to me and I was not disappointed. The moment the food came out it want directly in front of us. Our bartender Josh was great about letting us change up the wine pairings. In addition, he was friendly and attentive.

We ordered our food and she just kinda dropped everything off on one end of the table and then left.  The only waitress/bartender who ever came by to ask if we were okay was Lindsay.  It seemed like they thought they were too good to offer good service. Oh, yea, and Zoey was rude enough that I complained to the manager of the hotel.

The tables are far enough away from each other that you really feel like you are enjoying an outdoor picnic. The hamburger I had was yummy. I was there for a meeting with 4 other people and everyone raved about the lunch choices.

Too bad it was served cold w cold coffee."", ""The gelato may be very good, but I can't remember after such a negative dining experience.  With the exception of one person (the owner?) the staff were pretty missable.  Not a single smile to be had.  I don't expect my behind kissed, or even small talk, but I don't expect to give business to an establishment that hires people who seem bothered to be there.  There are three tables inside with ample room for a few more---not very family friendly.  Me, hubs and three children under 3 waited patiently for a table.  The icing on the cake was other customers---a lady practically climbed over my daughter to grab my hubs' seat when he got up to use the bathroom.  Seriously.  Not the establishment's fault, but all around poor attitude and rudeness abounded.  We won't be returning.  If you have children, pass on this place and enjoy ice cream at home."", ""We knew we had to wait in line, but the wait inside for food and drinks was ridiculous.  The waiter took a long time to come, she never checked on us and we had to get up 3 times to ask her for coffee and milk refills.  The pancakes are just OK, honestly IHOP has better pancakes.  Not impressed at all."", ""The staff is friendly and polite, the shop is always clean. Got my bellybutton pierced 2 weeks ago and have been gone back twice to get it looked at and the piercer has been more than patient with me."", ""Looks can be deceiving! I love the carne asada tacos! Carmello is good, Sonora dogs are good, everything here is good!! You must try it!"", ""We never got the oysters that we ordered before our entrees. When our entrees came they were far too salty to eat. As former residents of Belgium we were not impressed at all with the food. We were offered dessert to apologize for the oysters but honestly with so many other restaurant options in NOLA we still will not be back.  The cocktails, however, were good so maybe happy hour would be decent but again, I unfortunately can't comment on the oysters."", ""Against my first instinct, we decided to reserve a taxi cab to the airport. Although they were courteous on the phone when we needed the cab earlier, the taxi driver was so rude, cab #6. He didn't answer our greetings, he was driving at 70mph on a 45 zone and he didn't bother to check for road work in his huge GPS , which led us to take another road and ended up paying more than we expected, he had the nerve to get upset because HE didn't check his route before hand. I didn't care to tip him and I will definitely never use them again. I feel robbed."", ""The setting is great, has a modern feel to it. The food is pretty good some of it is a bit spicy. The reason I'm giving it such a low rating is because the waiters there are extremely rude, don't clean, and demand you tip them more after already leaving a 20% tip."", ""We wanted to pick up some Zima and a male employee was very nice and said they were sold out and Zima is sold out everywhere in town. So he helped us pick out something he said will be similar but turns out grocery stores and Walmart have Zima. Lies. Oh, and P.S. Mr. Man, Truly Lime and Midori tastes nothing like Zima and Midori so thanks for that too."", ""Gianna's has closed down.  *Sadface* :(  I will miss my Freebirds (vegan chicken steaks) and my GG Specials (vegan cheesesteaks)!!  At least I was able to bring my best friend from CA here during her visit in January when she was able to try the vegan pizza--it was the first time she had ever eaten anything resembling pizza in her life, and she loved it!"", ""Been here before, so had high expectations.  Ended up with mediocre burger and fries delivered by an indifferent server who clearly wished she was elsewhere.  The  tiny patty on our burgers was overwhelmed by the lettuce, tomato and onion garnish, and came with a stingy portion of room temperature fries.  Total price for two was $27.99.  Very disappointing.  I will not be back."", ""Paid for Deluxe Services almost 2 months prior to the event and only received a basic package at best. Attempts to resolve the issue with Keith have been returned with defensive dialogue, accusatory statements and untruths. His unprofessional approach has escalated this situation to the point of being settled in court. I have never been treated so poorly by a vendor."", ""The most relaxing mani pedi experience I have had in Tampa Bay and what excellent service!  The pedicure massage was really expert and honestly my toes have never looked so clean.  During that time Shannon took the time to come over and welcome me to town and to the spa.  Very customer focused.  I love my shellac mani too great color choices! Slightly more than I am used to paying but totally worth it..great value..will be back."", ""Don't waste your time or money! They can never get an order right, they are slow and most of the kids that work there are rude!"", ""Our first time here and it was excellent.  Very fresh ingredients and flavorful.  We had two different soups, chicken satay and pad Thai with amazing mango sticky rice for dessert.  We look forward to many return trips here."", ""Almost $4 for a slice of pizza??  I went to NY Pizza after a Mardi Gras parade last week. (Price gouge much?) The woman at the counter presented us with two options for individual slices: pepperoni and spinach. We asked why we couldn't see any green on top of the spinach pizza and she told us \""\""The spinach is under the crust\""\"" (spoiler alert: there was no spinach!). The service was prompt, despite them being busy, and we paid and left. Within ten steps of leaving the front door, the cheese on the \""\""spinach\""\"" slice slid off the bread and fell to the ground. Granted, I think this is probably in part due to the pizza-holder, but cheese should never slide off a pizza that easily. What a waste of $4. I won't be back."", ""Delicious both the burritos and Vietnamese! Come often for Pho and great Vietnamese food, but tried a burrito today for the first time! I am hooked!""]",8
