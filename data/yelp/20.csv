0,"[REVIEW_1] This is my favorite Sushi restaurant in Indy. I frequent here too much to admit; but its always good. Try the Tiger Roll! [REVIEW_2] Went to this store for an alignment;  when I parked the mechanics were just sitting with no work to do. At 8:30 this is not a good sing for the shop. They checked my vehicle and then notified me at I needed approx $1500.00 in repairs. They even said things that were just replaced needed to be replaced. Drove to my normal mechanic and only needed 2 parts for about 1/6 of the price.  Would not go to this place again. [REVIEW_3] After 2 visits; I do not have one negative thing to say about Moto!  Both times we were seated in the front of the restaurant; in a corner booth on the window.  I recommend trying for a table in that area if you want something a little more private/quiet!   The staff is very knowledgeable and helpful; and during our second trip they somehow ""remembered"" us from our first visit months earlier - commenting on the date we were last there and seating us at the same booth. I couldn't quite decide if it was creepy or impressive. We're obviously in some kind of database; no one has that good of a memory of a one time guest!  The food was fabulous both times! I had the blueberry lasagna the first time because I was just too curious not to.  Don't let the name fool you; it's a mushroom lasagna with a blueberry balsamic drizzled on. Delicious; but incredibly rich. But I wouldn't have been able to finish it anyway since I stuffed my face with Wagyu beef meatballs as a appetizer.  (Same beef as Kayne Prime. Just as delicious.) Also proven to be delicious: the prosciutto crostino; black pepper tagliatelle; chocolate mousse cake.   The food is so rich that I could never be a regular; but it's perfect for an occasional indulgent night. Prepare to leave there fat & happy and maybe wear something with a stretchy waistband. [REVIEW_4] Delicious pastries and coffee!! Friendly & accommodating staff and open; bright environment. Had the butterscotch bowtie- it was big but so good I finished it all. Highly recommend. [REVIEW_5] This is a nice; comfortable lounge in the Tuscany area of the Peppermill. Most nights there is mellow music to enjoy and the drinks are always strong and delicious. Happy hour is pleasing; with a discounted appetizer menu to choose from and yummy drink specials. The service is outstanding and the bar tenders are friendly.   This isn't the place you would frequent to get loud and crazy with your friends. Rather; Terrace is an elegant bar that is perfect for sipping a cocktail with friends; spending a romantic evening with a loved one or even enjoying some low key gambling at the bar.   The Terrace is a necessary stop when I visit the Peppermill. [REVIEW_6] Well; I'm a little late getting to this review...but I feel like I should make it known how awesome Preferred Party Rentals is.   My husband and I used Preferred Party Rentals for our backyard reception in early August. We didn't really waste too much time after getting engaged (February) to tie the knot; so planning was a little hectic; to say the least.  From the beginning; every single person I spoke to at PPR was courteous; helpful and accommodating. Initially; I placed my order with Mike and even made a few changes over email with him as well; which was wonderful. I even had a mini panic attack; the day before; over having a tent. (Early August being very hot; I had hesitation about having a tent at all as we were trying to save as much money as possible...My mother in law; being the voice of reason; told me that the tent was already cleaned and ready to go; so it went up and saved us from the showers we had the morning of the reception) I felt so silly about it later. My mother in law had also spoken to them a few times to add items to our order and commented on how pleasant they were to work with and how easily they went over the order with her and made changes.  Preferred Party Rentals is wonderful and I would absolutely work with them again... ...minus the breakdown. :) [REVIEW_7] If I could give no stars I would; the service team here is absolutely awful; just drive your broken car don't even bother coming here. [REVIEW_8] Welcome to Flavor Town!  This was my first time to try Indian food. I had the Chicken Curry and it was amazing. Staff was friendly and service was fast. [REVIEW_9] This review is for the front desk and the chef; Michael; from Cafe Elise. I got stuck flying with a package that the airlines were trying to force me to check. It was a painting that holds significant value to me. The airline told me to go up to UPS but they are closed on weekends. I panicked just a bit because I knew the airline would destroy it. (See YouTube baggage handling).   The guys at the restaurant and front desk had me fill out the form and locked my package in the office to be shipped Monday!  It was so sweet; convenient; and in a customer service world where everyone says no; they said yes.   Thanks guys! [REVIEW_10] Wholeheartedly agree with the other 1 stars.  I ordered my graduation attire that I had to buy (if you are an academic; just need to have them). I signed an order form with an already outrageous amount on it (approaching $1000); and then they charged 15% more than that; unannounced. I tried to contact them but no response. I ended up filing a complaint with the division of consumer protection. Avoid if you can. [REVIEW_11] Wonderful place- pumpkin pie cheesecake ice cream was great!!  $7.00 for 3 people instead of $7 per person!! [REVIEW_12] Best auto repair shop in the area. I go to no other shop for maintenance or repairs. I send my friends and people I don't care for to west county auto repair because I believe that Everyone deserved the best and that is WEST COUNTY AUTO SERVICE      ASK FOR ROB OR RON [REVIEW_13] This pub is awesome!! The restaurant is beautiful...wood furniture and tv's in the booths. The staff is always friendly and helpful as well. And the most important thing... the food is amazing!!! I always get the prime rib sandwich and it never fails. I also like that they offer a vegetable of the day rather then having to stick with chips or fries. The vegetables here are always fresh! My only complaint is that it's a little pricey. I get take out a lot and for two meals it's at least $20. Still; this place is worth a try!!! [REVIEW_14] If you are on bourbon street you have to come here.  You can watch whatever game you want.  The beers are amazing...you have to try the ragin cajun; its amazing.  The debris fries are a must; you wont be disappointed unless you dont try them.  I had the fireman burger and love that they donate $1 for every fireman burger to the local fire department.  The burger was very good and Shea was an amazing bartender.  Youll regret it if you dont stop in here.  Im coming back a second time no question about it. [REVIEW_15] This place is great; I really didn't want to love it bc I'm such a fan of green goddess. However; this sister restaurant is just a lovely [REVIEW_16] we stopped in just to randomly check for a few things -- who knew you could find birch beer in Arizona! other than that; we snagged some Vosges chocolate (Mo's Bacon Bar is the BEST!); strawberry Pocky; and random other goodies. The prices are a bit high; but most items are imported or hard to find; so it's kind of understandable. I think we drooled over the bakery section for about 20 minutes -- everything looked AMAZING! nice place to find unusual ingredients; and really fresh meat and seafood. [REVIEW_17] Sitting in the pedicure chair right now starting to write this- my first time here and so far so good. Came at 6pm on a weekday and it's just me in here.. Getting a pedicure and the girl massaged each of my legs for like 5 minutes straight and THEN came out with hot stones for more- AMAZING. Also got paraffin on my heels; not sure if that's the norm; but I needed it. Oh; then as you're drying MORE massages- this time an awesome back one! YES PLEASE. Only draw backs are: there are like no magazines to be found near the pedi chairs and the music is very old school (organ and piano instrumentals??); I also love to get BRIGHT colors but they don't really have any except in gel. But hey; for the massages I just got- well worth it. [REVIEW_18] I've been eating Mexican food all my life; and these are the best fish tacos I have ever eaten; hands down. The corn tortillas are handmade: very thick; soft; and tasty. The fish portion was generous; and they are dressed with pico de gallo and flavorful creamy sauce.   Pickled onion and radish shavings are served on the side and make a nice garnish; as does their (not too hot) red sauce.   I got the plate; which comes with beans; rice; and a drink. The beans were creamy and had a great flavor. Rice was ordinary ; but mix it with the rice; drip a little hot sauce on it and the flavors blend perfectly. You also get pickled carrot slices and they were great too.   I got their homemade horchata; and it was awesome too --cinnamon and spices--just right. They don't serve any alcohol.   The only drawback is the location. It is not in the best part of town.   And note the name--it is a taqueria--a taco shop. You order at a counter and go sit at metal tables. There is a lot of indoor seating; but be aware; it is not luxurious; and the menu is pretty limited; but the prices are great and the food is fantastic [REVIEW_19] I went  to Cafe at the Square 4 years ago. Someone was recently asking me about the wet food in New Orleans and I had to let them know to visit this place!!! They have the BEST fried green tomatoes!! Years later I'm still thinking about how amazing their food was xoxo [REVIEW_20] I had a good experience last night dining solo at the sushi bar. I had a crunch roll; a California; and two hand rolls. I was offered free soup and salad. The beer was deliciously ice cold. Service was warm and efficient.",17
1,"[REVIEW_1] We ordered delivery because I'm sick at home. For $12 carnitas that was supposed to come with cilantro; onion and salsa; non of these was included. they came with only a little bit of meat in two taco shells and tasted unseasoned. My pork shoulder was very chewy and was supposed to come with pickles but didn't.  The beans; potato salad; and coleslaw were all filled less than half way. Only good things are the toasts. We will not order from this place ever again. [REVIEW_2] Cake Bake is a must-visit if you are in Indy! Not only is the cake amazing; but the entire experience of your lunch/tea date/after-school treat is one of a kind. Every single detail is perfection. From the edible glitter on the cakes; brownies and cookies to the ornate silverware and platters to the French champagne; to the pink receipt paper; you will be in pretty pink princess heaven! It is over the top in the best kind of way. So fun for a girls date; bridal shower or a mommy and me outing. Today we celebrated with Red Velvet and 'Millionaire' cake and the sparkling (literally with floating glitter!) lemon lavender champagne as my sister found her dream wedding dress at a local bridal shop. Such a fun time! [REVIEW_3] Store is severely understaffed Waiting in line to check out can take up to 25 minutes  Avoid this store if possible  The workers are nice; but they know they are understaffed to make the profits look better as a strategy [REVIEW_4] First time here tonight. We got a salted caramel cupcake; a mocha chocolate chip cupcake; and a peanut butter pudding. The cupcakes were moist;  the frosting was so silky and creamy; so good. But the star of the show was the peanut butter pudding. Holy crow.  Never had anything like it before.  It was more of a creamy;whipped; mousse like pudding. The peanut butter flavor was not too sitting strong or overwhelming like peanut butter can be.  Throughout was some of her peanut butter cookies.  So soft;  it mixed wth the pudding like perfection. We live in nj but we will absolutely be back! [REVIEW_5] Super excited to try this place while in town for 24 hours. We sat at the small 12 person bar and it took awhile for someone to take our drink order as there was only one bartender on a Saturday night. About 5-6 servers did say hi to us though. Drinks were fine. Apps came out which was the shrimp cocktail and meatballs. Meatballs were under cooked shrimp cocktail was fine. I ordered the chefs cut 20oz bone in ribeye with a chili rub and the wife ordered the filet with one of their toppings of cheese and peppers. The ribeye came out on a cold plate so I sent it back and the manager came over and apologized profusely. The best thing about the wife's filet was the cheese on top. She ordered it med rare and it came out slightly above rare. My steak came back out. I always order mine rare at steak houses and this was like a soggy sponge. Literally couldn't swallow more then 3 bites. The actual cut of steak was one of the worst cuts I've ever seen. The steak was bland. I had to ask multiple times what the rub was because I couldn't taste anything not even salt or pepper.  The beans that came out with the steaks were under cooked and hard. Needless to say I actually didn't eat dinner. The server came and picked up my full plate of steak and threw it away. The chefs cut was 50 bucks. And the total bill was 150 I literally spend that much at least once a week on food so that's not a big deal.  But I would rather spend 150 bucks on double quarter pounders with cheese and have to eat them all in one sitting then eat anything at this place again.  From start to finish it was horrible. [REVIEW_6] Definitely not what it used to be when it was ""Christine's twisty treat"". There's sofas outside and it's an eyesore! I also went there before for a strawberry banana smoothie and the girl working said she didn't know how to make it bc she wasn't trained. [REVIEW_7] I used the mobile app; the bill was for $31  and I asked a friend to pick  it up. The store refused to give her the order because I was not there with my Card. I'd done this at least 6 times before without issue.  So I understand that TBELL is trying to watch out for my money.  not letting anyone steal using my account   So why then did they still charge me the $31 even though I never received the food.    Who is it I'm being protected from  hackers or Taco Bell itself.  I'm out $31  I've attempted to contact TBELL but I'm not able to get through to them. [REVIEW_8] I am positively LIVID.  I went to check my account balance and what do I see? An overdraft fee of $220. How could this happen? My card was never declined and there are two large fees deducted from my account.  I called TD and sat on hold for 45 MINUTES. I don't have that kind of time. Granted; the guy that was with me was nice and helpful; but never mentioned anything about the wait time until I brought it up. I asked about these fees and he said ""Just so you are aware; TD Bank's new policy is that when you have insufficient funds; your card will not be declined. It will be run through; and you will be charged an overdraft fee."" OH THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME NOW; JERK.  I have too many salty words that are unacceptable in the public domain; so I'll stop now.  Needless to say; I am switching banks.  Sort of UPDATE: I thought you Yelpers would like to know that last night; when I was depositing the cash that I didn't have into my account via ATM; I flipped off the cameras. TAKE THAT; TD. [REVIEW_9] Great food; great drinks; terribly (unapologetically so) service. It's not dick's last resort; it's not your shtick to be shitty... We had to ask for water four times and when we got it; it was luke warm.......annnnnd it wasn't busy.  like the vibe would consider coming back for drinks but would have to mentally prepare I was walking into a shit show. [REVIEW_10] Granted they got me my prism film for my glasses; and I went through a different optometrist for the frame. I brought my glasses in. The woman assisting me had me put the film on to measure it. Got that cleared up. Then she comes back 10 minutes later to tell me all done and it will be $35. Not bad price... but when she cut it she didn't bother to tell me she didn't cut them to actually fit my whole frame.   I showed her how she cut them incorrectly; and they look shattered on the sides bc of her cut job. Please do not make me pay for something and have it look like I can't afford a proper lense bc you felt like not doing your job properly.  I would give it one more star bc they have a good glasses selection [REVIEW_11] Not only was the driver reckless and erratic in his driving (I had my three-year-old with me; and he was turning corners like we were in a Hollywood car chase); he blasted vile right-wing propaganda--i.e. Sean Hannity--at earsplitting volume right behind my head the whole way. By the time we arrived at our destination; my blood pressure was off the scale. If you want tips and repeat business; DO NOT torture your passengers. [REVIEW_12] This place sucks! The one up on oracle and wetmore is where I usually go; however; I moved and the university location is closer. Sorry Silver mine you have lost my business forever.  First; I ordered two sandwiches a large homesteak  with no green onions. I accidentally typed onions instead of peppers that come on the sandwich. These bozos still proceed to put the greens on it and the manager laughs it off like no big deal.  Second; my hot homesteak sandwich was as cold as if had been sitting out for an hour. You guessed right it took an hour to get my food and then the hot sandwich was not wrapped in the proper wrapping to keep it warm. Lastly; the employee got rude with me when I was checking to see what time my order would be done. He proceeded to scold me about how he only got it two minutes ago and it will be done when its done. Not how you talk to a customer buddy!  Goodbye Silver mine! [REVIEW_13] Quite possibly THE BEST restaurant in philly. It's a very personal; small place which requires reservations well in advance for popular dining days/times. Northern Italian fine cuisine of the highest quality by James Beard Award winning chef Marc Vetri. A visit to Vetri Ristorante is a special occasion in itself.  $$$$ [REVIEW_14] I had a similar experience like one of the previous reviewers. I was given a quote for HR-V online for 19;507. I went there; test drive it talked about the quote I was give online from that dealer and they printed out the offer. The salesman leave  and when he came back 20-30mins later; he  said that it most had been a mistake cause the average if 21;500( for the price of the vehicle). I guess they don't understand very well what does average mean; which is some people bought at a higher price and some at a lower price. The salesman was very polite and respectful but he said that he couldn't give the deal they gave us online and it was up to the manager ( which I previously heard getting too loud with another costumer). I decided that I prefer to pay the price they wanted us to pay now ( 22;507) to another dealer; than to pay it to a dealer that try to trick us.  Business is all about respect ( which they didn't have for us and our time) and honesty ( which they didn't have as they try to say it must had been an error from the internet). At the end of the day they tried to change the quote the gave us when the manager saw that they would be making as much as they wanted for the vehicle. Conclusion; unless you know one of the salesman or don't mind the change of price just cause; do yourself a favor and go to another dealership. [REVIEW_15] I dined here yesterday with two friends and we all ordered shrimp and grits. When our orders were brought out; the shrimp and grits were cold and hard and looked as if they had been sitting out for a while. We sent them back and asked if they could send us fresh grits but unfortunately the new grits were the same. It was pretty insulting that they would even think that we should eat food of that quality. I have visited this restaurant many times in my past visits to New Orleans; but I will not return. [REVIEW_16] Really good selection of super cute bikinis! Plus good location & lots of parking. They also let me know if they didn't have my size they would order it for me 10% off and free shipping . Definitely will be back [REVIEW_17] We paid $230 per night for our stay during the Memorial Weekend and man how I wish I stayed at Motel 6 at next door instead. The location is prime - walkable to tons of cute little restaurant and even Whole Foods. However; the room was way too shabby - we can hear very loud TV noise from our neighbor rooms clearly; no mini fridge; the arrangement of furnitures was disfunctioning; only two table lamps in the entire room; including one doesn't even work; and the dark light makes the room more creepy.. The breakfast was similar quality to their room - very limited choice and low quality GMO products.  You probably can understand my disappointment knowing the price I paid now! [REVIEW_18] I don't know this for sure; but my first impression of this place is that it is run by unscrupulous people. Come along with me; as I journey back in time -- all the way back to Wednesday...  I step foot in this 7 Eleven; and the first thing I think is: this is one of the nicest looking 7 Elevens I've ever seen. It is very clean; bright; and spacious. Very nice looking selection of prepared meals. There were many that actually looked like they'd be quite good. But I wasn't hungry this day. No. All I needed were a few items.   First; some good old TP. And let me be perfectly clear (as clear as Barack Obama): I DON'T buy the cheapest toilet paper because I'm cheap. I buy it because I like the way the cheap stuff feels. The more like sandpaper; the better. I like to feel like its working. I don't need to or even want to feel like an angel is up there. Or some perverted freak named Scott.   In any case; I got myself 4 rolls. And then I just needed one more thing - some plastic cups for a little party I'm having this weekend.   I go ahead and drop my stash on the counter; begin to extract several singles from my wallet; when the cashier looks at me and says; ""24.99.""  I respond; ""That's not right.""  He points at a price tag on the plastic cups which reads 19.99. I begin laughing. I tell him the price is clearly wrong. He tells me he's got to talk to his manager. Meanwhile; I tell the folks behind me waiting in line that I'm just going to go run and get different plastic cups to hurry the process along. Before he got back from doing his price check; I already had another cashier ringing up my two sleeves of cups for 1.99 each. That's more like it.  At around that same moment; the first cashier comes back from his consultation with his manager. He tells me that the price was; in fact; incorrect. And that the price is actually 14.99.  THAT'S the unscrupulous part.  CLEARLY; THAT price is also far too high. His manager did no actual price check at all. He simply told the cashier to pretend that the real price was actually 5 dollars less; thinking that I'd be stupid enough to accept this. Why; because I'm white; and you're a racially superior Indian? You think white people are stupid don't you? We'll just believe what you tell us; and fork over our money. [REVIEW_19] Avoid! Great location with dynamic view of Jackson Square; but it has nothing else going for it. Lackluster food and service; no locals would ever eat here; for it is known as just a tourist rip-off. Pay attention to your bill; as they sneak in an obligatory 15% ""service"" charge. [REVIEW_20] I have currently been sitting in the same chair for 36 minutes waiting for a take out order that consists of one combination plate with hot braised chicken. I haven't ordered anything ridiculous or out of the ordinary; yet here I am. If I didn't already pay for the food or had any confidence in their ability to refund me; I would leave and go elsewhere. I haven't been assured that my food is coming soon; had anyone apologize to me for the wait; or even acknowledge my existence. It's now been 44 minutes since I first sat down and I am being nodded at. I guess that means my order is ready. I'll update this review when I actually get to eat the food.",4
2,"[REVIEW_1] I haven't had a haircut in ages due to a bad experience at Salon Marceline... I finally got over it and decided to try Angela at 19 Blue today. I have very long wavy hair and she cut it perfectly and made it look so much healthier. Everyone is really nice and the atmosphere is cozy. Overall great experience. ;) [REVIEW_2] The blue version of Razoo; this is a bunch of sweaty tourists who will crowd and probably vomit on you.  Everytime i walk by the place; House of Pain is on:  ""Jump! Jump around! Jump! Jump around!"" [REVIEW_3] This place has an amazing lunch special. I definitely recommend the lunch special that has two sushi rolls and a salad for 9 dollars. If you go to Jefferson it is really close by as well; so definitely come after exams. [REVIEW_4] I really wanted to like Casselli's; but it wasn't in the cards. Maybe I just caught them on a bad night; but I didn't really enjoy much about my visit. The waiter was very unpleasant - was banging down the plates and glasses on the table when he delivered them. Maybe he was having a bad day; but I still would have expected better.   We had mixed experiences with the food. Mine and our friends' was OK; but my wife's baked ravioli would have been more use to a hockey team for use as pucks. They were really overdone - woefully overdone.   The worst part was that our table was next to the opera singer guy. He was singing extremely loudly and it was nigh impossible to maintain a conversation - especially coupled with how close we were to the table next to us and their attempts to speak over Opera Guy.  Part of me wants to give them another chance (since I hate writing bad reviews) and the other part is annoyed over the waiter's attitude. I probably will not go back. There are so many good Italian restaurants worth visiting that the opportunity cost of returning to Casselli's seems too high.  On the upside; they have somewhat convenient parking in the lot behind the restaurant (near the Shawmont School).  Note: cash-only. [REVIEW_5] I loved this place; but drove by today to see it was closed for business and there were for sale signs in the windows. [REVIEW_6] Love it here  The atmosphere is great the options are more than average and the lunch bento boxes are great.  If you have the opportunity always try the boba as well.  Those complaining are just picky and should go back to eating at home.    Try their beef braised soup as it is hearty and delicious. [REVIEW_7] We visit every weekend for breakfast; it's a very nice and cozy cafe with good food and great service. Free wifi too! We recommend it 100%. [REVIEW_8] I found this place through yelp. I was attracted because of the +4 star rating! It was right down the street from where I was staying; so I ended up walking. I walked right in with no appointment and was taken immediately. The gentleman who did my nails was extremely nice and worked very precisely! We also had a few laughs too. He did amazing work and I also think it was the fastest mani I have ever gotten. He also did a light hand massage at the end. I got gel and it was $25 which I thought was reasonable. I will definitely go back when I'm back in the area. Highly recommend.   It is a spacious salon with many mani and pedi stations! [REVIEW_9] Horrible service. I had an appointment everything was on track; came back an hour and half later (during drop off they said it would be done) to find out they never even started my car. No phone call nothing. An hour and half after a scheduled oil change and your car was never touched. Safe to say they will never get my service. [REVIEW_10] If you dream of the perfectly romantic location providing the upper echelon in pastries and baked goods; there's no need to hold out for your dream trip to Paris; just make your way to The Cake Bake Shop.    The beautifully landscaped garden and flower boxes are just a tease of what you'll see inside; with every detail taken into consideration enticing your eyes to wander throughout the store.    I was on a mission to get a cake for my boss and was able to scored the award winning Earl's Chocolate cake.  I enjoyed a mimosa and scone as I waited; and was thrilled when it was brought out.  The presentation was as exquisite as the cake itself; complete with a signature box tied up in ribbon.  I took a menu to share with my group; and magically served the 8"" cake to the masses (usually serves 8-10) once I made the grand entrance.     I must admit; I've never spent that much on a cake that size; but the raves that were received and interest in where it came from were proof enough (if not the crumbs in the box) to affirm my decision was a stellar one.  My boss also mentioned he'd never had a cake as delicious!  I'll be sure to bring this up when it's time for my review. [REVIEW_11] I also will follow Lena to the ends of the earth. I want to throw a crazy party in this place every time I walk through the doors; the space is an intense combination or rave; old school Italian South Philly  (GOLD! CHANDELIERS! MIRRORS!); and sheik!  Liberty and Lena kick some serious ass as a team! Lena is fabulous; need a nice conservative 'do for corporate america; she got you; need a 3 foot high beehive; giiirl; and HOW. She will take the time needed to make sure every strand is cut to perfection. Liberty makes you feel at home as soon as you walk through the door; sit on the comfy old school couch; imbibe a glass of complimentary wine; and absolutely pet Justice the BIG and gorgeous blueish silver pup that lazes with pink toe nails. (Don't be afraid; she is a big baby who just wants some lovins! Don't we all... ) Do yourself a favor and give this place a try; its affordable; its super fun; and you get to hang out with Haggrid's dog from the Harry Potter movies! [REVIEW_12] Hated this place I went in to try an egg roll and get a sushi roll and both were bad the egg was horrible and the sushi was chewy so I wasnt surprised that I was the only one there [REVIEW_13] I still haven't received a phone call or an email to try and rectify this issue. I guess I need to call the corporate office. [REVIEW_14] I love the pho here; it's so good. The other menu offerings are really good too; such as the fried rice and Chinese food menu options that they offer. The pho is obviously the main attraction tho! [REVIEW_15] This place is where the former Pollo Loco used to be next to the launder-mat. I'm always in search of the best breakfast burrito and this place has it. Delicious homemade flour tortillas made daily along with a fresh salsa bar with 4 different salsas to choose from. They offer daily specials too! I'll definitely be back for lunch & dinner. [REVIEW_16] Cute; classy; chic; and cheap! You get some cool finds here varying from handmade to vintage. The owners accessorized me for my prom with their awesome handmade jewelry. [REVIEW_17] First of all; I have mixed hair; which can be tricky when trying to find a good hairdresser. I went there today; very nervous in order to get a blow out and a trim. Eric was my hairdresser and all I can say is that he is AMAZING! My hair is silky and straight! I will definitely go back! [REVIEW_18] By far my favorite sushi place in St. Louis.  The food and the service are outstanding.  I highly recommend the Fancy Roll; the Yummy Roll; and the pot stickers are amazing.  The sauce they make for the pot stickers is their own recipe and it's delicious.  Ask for it to dip your sushi in too. [REVIEW_19] The food was cold and the drinks tasted weird. I believe it is overpriced it's all you can eat buffet but I just got one plate and still had to pay the full price but it's whatever. Definitely not coming back. [REVIEW_20] I purchased two apple trees from Magic Garden late this spring/early summer.  First Chris; one of the sales managers; asked me exactly where we lived and suggested different trees than those I had thought of initially. He explained about the differences in weather/heat/cold conditions etc. He was very knowledgeable. Then a few weeks after planting the trees I noticed one was not doing well....it was losing leaves and looking miserable. It had been VERY hot and windy...and as it turned out I was not compensating with enough water for the extreme weather we were having. I called Chris and he explained how to properly provide enough water for the trees and lo and behold...the sad apple tree sprang back to life with wonderful new greenery within about 10 days and the other one which I thought had been doing well; doubled the number of leaves and began flowering. I think that the staff at Magic Garden not only sells appropriate plants for your needs but really understands how to care for them. I will continue going back to Magic Garden over the coming years!!!",14
3,"[REVIEW_1] Went here to redeem Groupon; frist time staff member said she couldn't use system and for me to come back after she extended it. I went back and I was told I was out of luck it expired.  Way to waste my time and very un-Yoga like. I will stick with Wake up Yoga and PSC; they know how to treat people. [REVIEW_2] Went back with my mom because I couldn't think of better competition at the time. She's much more keen to detail; specifically cleanliness. We took our food to go as she was jaw dropped at how unkept this place is. Also worth mentioning is that over my MANY drop ins for a quick coffee; the coffee counter has never once been fully stocked. Too many one star visits. Was great in comparison to the one up Easton road that closed. Now is just gross. [REVIEW_3] Really? $45.00 to ""hold my rate?"" The trick fees and surprise billing that shows up in my checking account every few months is garbage. The monthly fee doesn't sound so bad; but the surprise fees and the $100.00 fee to cancel the account is somewhat discouraging as well.   You can work out here if you're rich and have money to blow; but being a member here has severe financial disadvantages. [REVIEW_4] We paid $230 per night for our stay during the Memorial Weekend and man how I wish I stayed at Motel 6 at next door instead. The location is prime - walkable to tons of cute little restaurant and even Whole Foods. However; the room was way too shabby - we can hear very loud TV noise from our neighbor rooms clearly; no mini fridge; the arrangement of furnitures was disfunctioning; only two table lamps in the entire room; including one doesn't even work; and the dark light makes the room more creepy.. The breakfast was similar quality to their room - very limited choice and low quality GMO products.  You probably can understand my disappointment knowing the price I paid now! [REVIEW_5] Their pizza is pretty good; service is usually cool inside. But today I ordered a delivery for the first time; the driver was very insulting to me. When I open my door she asked me about a car across the street with a guy in the driver's seat. I replied ""I don't know;"" she said ""cus I don't wanna be set up to get robbed"". Mind you I already paid with my visa when I ordered; her behavior made me feel awkward as if I had done something wrong. I gave her the tip I had in my hand and said thank you; hoping that maybe if I remain polite she'll stop thinking so negative I just wanted some pizza not to be judged because of my surroundings or to be stereotyped. [REVIEW_6] The buttermilk chicken and the donut they give you with it were both disgusting. Couldn't even finish it. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Idk. [REVIEW_7] We waited 25 minutes to order a glass of water & 10 minutes later I had to go to the bar to ask if our waitress could come over so we could order food. She was very unfriendly and felt like we were an inconvenience. The temperature was very cold and uncomfortable. Our food was barely warm and slipped on the plate. Certainly will not be back!! [REVIEW_8] Terrible delivery service & food order was incorrect once received an hour over what I was told.  All the food was under or over cooked.  Never again!  Sad [REVIEW_9] Super excited to try this place while in town for 24 hours. We sat at the small 12 person bar and it took awhile for someone to take our drink order as there was only one bartender on a Saturday night. About 5-6 servers did say hi to us though. Drinks were fine. Apps came out which was the shrimp cocktail and meatballs. Meatballs were under cooked shrimp cocktail was fine. I ordered the chefs cut 20oz bone in ribeye with a chili rub and the wife ordered the filet with one of their toppings of cheese and peppers. The ribeye came out on a cold plate so I sent it back and the manager came over and apologized profusely. The best thing about the wife's filet was the cheese on top. She ordered it med rare and it came out slightly above rare. My steak came back out. I always order mine rare at steak houses and this was like a soggy sponge. Literally couldn't swallow more then 3 bites. The actual cut of steak was one of the worst cuts I've ever seen. The steak was bland. I had to ask multiple times what the rub was because I couldn't taste anything not even salt or pepper.  The beans that came out with the steaks were under cooked and hard. Needless to say I actually didn't eat dinner. The server came and picked up my full plate of steak and threw it away. The chefs cut was 50 bucks. And the total bill was 150 I literally spend that much at least once a week on food so that's not a big deal.  But I would rather spend 150 bucks on double quarter pounders with cheese and have to eat them all in one sitting then eat anything at this place again.  From start to finish it was horrible. [REVIEW_10] Can't believe this pit stays open. Like walking into a Fellini set. Disgusting. Dirty. [REVIEW_11] They served me a frozen pizza and skunked beer.  'Nuff said. [REVIEW_12] Conveniently located but they jack the price up unfairly when they feel like it. Watch them when they ring you up when you buy alcohol. [REVIEW_13] We'll I thought the place was going out of business. They basically had no cigar selection. [REVIEW_14] Disappointing experience. Pastries (had the croissant; eclair; cannoli) are okay but nothing amazing. Dining area is small. Very limited drink options. I agree with previous reviews that it is very reminiscent of break-room coffee with 2 pump pots full of coffee and buy-in-bulk tea bags.    Really what soured the experience was the counter staff.  After my SO and I purchased several pastries; coffee; tea and went to sit down; the staff informed us that we couldn't stay because they were closing. The sign says 5pm; this was at 4pm.  She assured us that it was just that day they were closing early.   No apology. Just informed us and walked away. After all this; I had to remind her that I was still waiting for a cup of hot water to steep my warehouse earl grey tea in. We came to the cafe to sit and enjoy tea and pastries so it was obviously a disappointment to get kicked out before the advertised closing time.  I would have greatly appreciated being informed of the earlier hours prior to making a purchase or at least in the form of a sign. Would much rather enjoy a pre-made croissant and better drink options at the adjacent Starbucks or PJs. Lesson learned. [REVIEW_15] I have been to a couple of Keke's in other cities; however; was exceedingly disappointed with my experience today. After an hour of waiting we were told our order was misplaced and it would be out shortly. I understand these things happen; yet the employees and manager made no attempts to make our experience better. The manager acknowledged once the food was delivered that the portions were small and inaccurate. However; icing on the cake was the waitress dropping off the check as we finally got our first bite. Not to check on us even during the rest our meal. If someone had made a single attempt to make our experience better I would not be writing this review; but today I paid for extremely poor service and I do not plan to return. [REVIEW_16] Friendly service but the food isn't worth eating. I tried to sample everything to try and find something to at least fill me up for a meal; everything is over cooked to the point where it's hard or rubbery. Ended up just getting a box of cereal. 11.99 each person; would have been better off eating at the sit down spot in silver legacy [REVIEW_17] This location is suffering and will undoubtedly come on the radar for improvement. Not only was customer service the furthest thing from any employees mind; the food was terrible. We attempted to go through the drive-thru. Sat there forever with no greeting or any sign of life from the speaker. The screen was blank. Thought maybe it was broken so we drove around. A few cars in front of us but no one moving so I went inside to order to-go. 2 people ahead of me. 5-6 minutes later someone came to take the 1st guys order but couldn't use the register. 2nd guy was in line for a refuns because he was double charged for an incorrect order. I ordered. 4 sandwiches; not a single one had the correct toppings. Burgers cold. Fish sandwich over cooked. Fries were cold and gross. We didnt even eat half our meal and threw it away. I would give negative stars if I could. [REVIEW_18] Horrible food.  Bread sticks totally dry. Mozzarella sticks more salty than salt itself. And the worst tasting; bland; fettuccine alfredo ever.  Gave it a try despite the 1.5 stars but shouldn't have risked it. Wish I could give them a zero. [REVIEW_19] Cannot vouch for the doctor; as the receptionist was so breathtakingly rude that I didn't even schedule an appointment. They might want to rethink their desk staff if they want to appear welcoming and friendly. [REVIEW_20] My husband and I decided to finally try Picca's on a Thursday night. We arrived around 7pm. We were told there was a 15-20 minute wait. However there were tons of tables open; but okay. I have a background in the biz so I understand sometimes there may be things behind the scenes like short staffed or doubling seating servers; etc. We waited 15 minutes and were sat. The ambience in this place reminds me of the inside of a Pizza Hut sit down restaurant when they used to have the buffets. Not too impressed. The menu also reminds me of a chain-like Italian wannabe. Nothing special or innovative. Yawn. Our server was friendly and took our drink order. She dropped the drinks off and said she would be right with us. We drank our drinks and waited... And waited... And waited... No sign of her! I looked at my watch. It was going on 8pm.  35 minutes and she never came to take our order. We left some cash for the drinks and headed to another restaurant...one we felt confident would be a better experience.  Can't tell you how the food was; but it is safe to say we will never go back.",0
4,"[REVIEW_1] I just took my dog here for the first time and it was a great experience. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable and it is also very affordable. I would recommend University Pet Clinic to anyone! [REVIEW_2] Excellent dentist; caring person; wonderful staff.  No waiting. Free street parking; never had a problem finding within a block or so in this South Philly neighborhood.  An artist whose work adorns the office and a similarly skilled artist when mending/replacing teeth! (A Michaelangelo for the mouth.)    Great pre-chemo checkup and care (you can't go to dentist during chemo because it crushes your immune system).  Proactively wrote prescription for mouth rinse (for dry mouth or thrush) that might be needed due to chemo reaction.  Fortunately; I only needed the over the counter alternative he also recommended; Biotene.  Staff seems to remember every detail about people and their issues -- caring; lovely; helpful.  Is it possible to actually look forward to going to the dentist?  Dr Stern has created a dental oasis.  In my experience; accepts dental insurance reimbursement as payment in full.  Others charge hundreds more and quality not even as good. [REVIEW_3] i saw maggie for a lash & brow tint and am super happy with the outcome! she mixed the perfect shade for my brows and now i feel cute without filling them in. great customer service in this store; i will be back! [REVIEW_4] Just had an awesome meal at Mirko. Jenn was our server and so sweet and fun. We sat on the patio with our dog and she brought a bowl of water and was very patient with the pup :) can't wait to come back! [REVIEW_5] Really truly slow service.  Not the waitress. The kitchen. 40 min to get a pasta and salad.  Recommended if you want to really drag that date out. [REVIEW_6] I was in town for business with myself and a couple of co workers we were looking for a good place to relax and have some ice cold beers. Came across The Craft House on Yelp and we were very pleased with the awesome craft beer selection they have! I tried the Hop King Imperial IPA and it was fantastic! The bartender recommended the new shrimp po boy sandwich and it was delicious reminded me of a po boy I had in New Orleans. We played some pool and had a great time. I will be returning to The Craft House on my next business trip this coming summer. Thanks for the great food; beer and service! [REVIEW_7] Two Tommy Bahama shirts and Saks suit pants dropped off; one shirt looked worse than before I dropped it off; the pants torn and burnt!  Avoid this place the owners took zero responsibility.  Rude beyond what I thought was possible! [REVIEW_8] Loud loud loud!  And the food sucks. They got new management not too long along; doubt they made an improvements. [REVIEW_9] HORRIBLE!!! DONT waste your time or money! Been getting acrylics for 15 years and they are the WORST!!! Clueless woman and RUDE AF!  They cut me And made me wait and were rude to me after I waited and had lady start my nails ( while waiting for nail tech) who I know didn't even have a certificate to do nails. [REVIEW_10] Here's a story that sums up this Nordstrom for me.  When I was 17; I had to exchange a sweater I got for Christmas.  I was looking at the sale table and found one I liked; but it was missing a price tag.  I found another example; but it was also lacking a price.  So I got a salesman and he found four of the same sweaters; all missing a price tag.  Another salesman starts looking on another table.  Still no dice.  They've been looking for fifteen minutes and apparently the one knew how much it cost; but didn't want to tell me in case he was wrong.  They finally call a supervisor and he or she approves the one salesman's price without really knowing if its right.  Its about 50% more than the other sweaters on the table and way out of the price range for most 17 year olds; including mine.  I wasn't expecting to spend that much; but it was nice and how can service get more amazing?  Two salesmen spent twenty minutes of their time two days after Christmas to help an averagely dressed kid find a sweater he probably wouldn't have purchased.  That's five stars to me. [REVIEW_11] I scheduled an appointment and was told someone would be out bw 9 and 12. No one showed up. When i called to inquire when some would arrive (2:30pm); i was told my order slip never printed and no one would come out today. Would i like to reschedule for Monday. Very disappointing when you take off from work and waste your entire day. [REVIEW_12] Awesome place!   I wish I had one closer to where I live. Homemade Italian breads and desserts in all different shapes and sizes.   Great subs and pizza Great place a must stop [REVIEW_13] I am giving this restuarant one star because we did not dine there. We attempted to though. We showed up on a Saturday night about 8:30 pm. The parking lot was full but we did not see a line or anything to look like there was a wait. When we walked inside the music downstairs was so loud it sounded like a Salsa club. There was no host to greet us. Finally a man came up to us and told us they were booked for the night and that there was ""going to be a long wait"". Uh okay... He did mention we were welcomed to sit at the end of the bar if we wanted to. Who wants to eat a nice dinner at the end of a bar?   We will not be back to try to eat here. [REVIEW_14] Arrived to restaurant and were informed we could sit at bar to avoid waiting for service.  We located seating at the high top bar which we were told would be adequately serviced. Our waiter approached asking if we wanted drinks and ordered water. After waiting nearly 20 minutes our waiter returned requesting our order; as she sat down menus.. We politely informed her that we did not receive menus and would need time to order. She indicated she would return in a moment to place our order. After another 10 minutes she returns and took our order. My salad was right however we were not provided utensils; which I had to go fetch myself. My husband also inquired if a specific game could be showed on the tv. Our waitress stated she would check and returns to tell my husband he would need to ask all 8 folks sitting at the bar if it would be okay to change one of the tvs that's showing the same things as 2 other tvs. The final thing that has disappointed me and caused me to waste my time to make this complaint is that 2 men who arrived nearly 5 minutes after us placing our order were provided their food (nachos) before us who also had ordered one nacho.   Contacted management with no response! Nice atmosphere; HORRIBLE service! [REVIEW_15] Fresh Bar; full of delicious fresh foods with a range of salads; wraps; and soups. Yum!  On Magazine St is this great vegetarian food bar that offers a very large range of salad options; wrap options; and soup options. The set up is easy enough to grasp. You walk in; check out the menu and place your order where you're able to add or change anything you'd like(think Subway style).   There is only inside seating available with tables and chairs set up along the window and the wall. There is also a free refill station for iced tea to the side also; which is a nice tough.   You can order a salad; a wrap; or a combo which comes with a salad and a choice of soup.   I ordered a Fresh Cobb wrap that came with lettuce(you pick which one you want); tomatoes; egg; bacon; avocado; and your choice of salad dressing. It was pretty nice but the bacon flavoring was a bit too overpowering; which somewhat lessened the appeal of the wrap.   Overall; it's a great; healthy option for those who want to eat healthy. Definitely check it out! [REVIEW_16] Great food & pleasant service.  Would order any of our dishes again & staff Robert & Gregory were both very entertaining but not overbearing. [REVIEW_17] Horrible experience; pizza was soggy and cold when I received it; took 2 hours until I actually received my order as well. Absolutely no communication on my order; even after calling twice. Once I finally received the pizza I called to get my money back; which was communicated that I would not be charged; soon to find out that I was charged the very next day. I highly recommend never ordering from here; service was horrible and they were extremely rude. I won't be ordering from here again and either should you. [REVIEW_18] Poor service and overpriced hookah. Flavors are from star buzz but charge about 30-50% more than most places. They charge for more coals when they burn out. Food wasn't great either. Definitely wouldn't come here again. [REVIEW_19] Definitely should have read the reviews first.   Ordered $100 worth of pizza for a 13 year Olds birthday.  Gave then 2 hours notice.  The pizza still showed up an hour late; cold and tasteless.  Absolutely awful.    Never again. [REVIEW_20] Great!  Girl my phone was super attentive and friendly.food arrived hot and fresh. Think we finally found a good delivery place in this area.",10
5,"[REVIEW_1] I'm from out of town and picked up an awful sinus infection. I neeeeeded hot and sour soup. I got broth with some vegetables and about 2 ounces of corse ground pepper. It was awful. I ordered for my son and husband and their food was awful. The crab Rangoon was burnt.  Three entrees; 1 pint hot and sour soup and one order crab Rangoon. It was almost 60 bucks for tiny boxes of food. [REVIEW_2] Disaster! Avoid! Restaurant is extremely dated & service poor. Food is mediocre a best. Chicken parm was dark brown around edges & sauce had a weird after taste; almost like it had come from a can/tin. Instead of spaghetti; I had penne. Penne was terrible; pretty much crunchy with same strange tasting sauce as chicken parm. Would never go back! Avoid this place!! [REVIEW_3] I have been to this restaurant three times now.  The first time the service wasn't great but the food was really good.  The second time the food was still very good but half of the food came out about 15 min before everyone else's food after an already long wait.  This last time was the worst experience I have had thus far.  I ordered food to go and they said it would be 15-20 min.  The food took 45 minutes. They left out my guacamole and a chicken taco.  I also ordered the steak and bean quesadilla which had no beans on it; no lettuce; sour cream; pico or guacamole; and also had a hair in it.  When I called to complain the manager was unapologetic and only offered a refund if I was willing to ""take the food back"" when I was already across town.  I did not expect a full refund but the least they could do is apologize and offer to refund the quesadilla and the guacamole and chicken taco that were left out of the order. I was mostly upset by the fact that I wanted to love this place.  I really tried but I will not be back. [REVIEW_4] This place is super unprofessional. The manager who says his name is ""Johnson"" is extremely unprofessional. He doesn't understand that when working in a place of business where people are accompanied by their children you cannot curse out loud. He also doesn't understand that of a customer comes in close to closing time you don't tell them to hurry up. I don't care how good the food is. I wouldn't know because I lost my appetite and left. This guy is trash. And the management should realize that he's a reflection of them and their business. Definitely stay away. If you're starving; eat air. This place is terrible [REVIEW_5] We tried this place because it was new to the area and we like to give new businesses a chance. When we walked in; the hostess seemed very a bit aloof to what was going on. After being sent to our table by the window; we ordered our food. My son ordered a chocolate chip pancake (with the chips just thrown on top and not even added to the batter) and my wife ordered a fish sandwich that looked like it was straight out of a bag from target. Then my we ordered a kids meal for my toddler and the nuggets were the same ones that you buy from the supermarket. Not only was the food store bought; we all got sick after our meal!! Not even an hour after we left my son and wife were running to the restroom. Extremely disappointed and disgusted with this place. I never enjoy giving negative reviews; but this needed to happen. STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!! [REVIEW_6] I called Remember Me for some basic information.  The woman that answered the phone told me her name; after I asked; was Diane.  I asked if she was the manager.  She rambled on about not being able to run something and that she would call me back.  I told her that I didn't need her to call me back; but instead just the manager's name.  She said the same thing about calling me back.  So I asked if she was the manager and she hung up on me.  I wouldn't spend a dime here.  If this is the way they treat potential customers that are simply calling I can't imagine how they treat people in the store. [REVIEW_7] I received a vase of flowers for Mother's Day and they are terrible. I'm sure my son paid top dollar; because he always does. But this very small bouquet had only three roses that never opened and wilted within two days. The rest of the arrangement was cheap filler flowers. It came in a plain glass vase with dirty water and no bow or ribbon. They forgot the candy that came with it and had to deliver it later in the day. Look elsewhere if you are looking to send an impressive gift; because this one was not. [REVIEW_8] Just meh ramen; having people wait outside in line; in the sun; is in fact a stupid idea (even though management was so petty they put a sign on the door stating it's not a dumb idea). The wait staff sucked; couldn't get a refill on drinks the entire time we were there; and the server told me not to use Sriracha or I would ruin my meal; kid please; I know what I like; if I want Sriracha give me the dang sauce. Overall just a crappy restaurant; only reason it will stay in business is the hipsters. [REVIEW_9] Unbelievably the worst experience shopping I've had in a long time. Pre shopped online at home to find 3 of a particular tool chest they had in stock. Looked good. Drove down to the location minutes after confirming the stock. When I arrived I talked to no less than 3 associates who all were clueless as to where the item was. After being abandoned multiple times while they went to ""go look for me"" and then found these same associates helping other customers I decided to go up to the customer service desk to seek assistance. When I arrived there they also had no idea why their computers showed 3 items in stock but couldn't find them still. Ok so I begrudgingly agreed to have a new item shipped to the store (they couldn't figure out how to ship it to the store closest to me so I again; beaten down; acquiesced to driving down to this much further store to get the item I wanted.) I was told we'll have the item here in 1-2 days. Great. Fast forward to 5 days later. The store has no idea where the new item is. I wish I was making this up; but it gets better! They have no idea where it is! And tell me the order had actually been canceled on their end. But... it's in stock at another store even further away! I leave upset but determined to get my item. Fast forward. I'm now at the other store with the receipt for my initial purchase which was refunded because they could not find the item. Which shows a discounted price for my troubles. The other store now says they can't match the price of the original store because that was a discount they gave me and they are different stores. So finally I gave up and went else where. I've had some bad customer service experiences in my day but this one may take the cake. Cheers to you Home Depot. I salute your commitment to underachieving! [REVIEW_10] worst dealer by far stay clear of this place brought my van in for servicethe tech 35602 has made me wast lots of money and time after all the worst he has done i have the same issues he just had me replace my engine for nothing it still broken and my old engine was fine low milage ran great i took a chance but feel as if this guy is just throwing parts at my van rather then properly diagnostic time save your money go to falcony in speed way   update found techs name is josh like mine haha but stay clear of him [REVIEW_11] this place is amazing.  i don't get cravings for italian food a lot; but MAN! their meatball sub is heaven... like i want one now... right now... not kidding...  their food is always so fresh and you can taste it. at first i saw their portions and was all ""this is not enough to be called italian"" but half way through you're waving the white flag... but then the food is so nommy you just don't want to stop. and you finally do when you've used the last of their amazing bread to lap up the last drops of sauce... THAT'S ITALIAN!  i never make it to gelato; but the one time i tried some from a friend he ordered ""chocolate covered bacon"" and the base flavor was smooth and delicious; the chocolate covered bacon part started off good... tasted like toffee... then this hickory smoked flavor comes in from left field... needless to say... i'll be getting my own flavors [REVIEW_12] The Morning Cuban. It could be renamed ""Gout on a Plate;"" but HOLY $H!T is this open faced breakfast sandwich good. It comes on a thick slice of toasted bread (the type they use for french toast); with roasted pulled pork; swiss cheese; ham; 2 fried eggs on top; with a generous portion of house green salsa slathered over the top; creating a moat of not-too-spicy green goodness. Holy sh!t. This makes me think of ""the morning after"" breakfast after partying in Miami's South Beach with some bangin Cuban honeys. Yes; it's like THAT. This sh!t is soooo bomb. I kept muttering expletives to myself as I dug through the plate with my fork. Damnnnn.  Actually; even better than the ""normal"" Morning Cuban... if you ask for a small cup of their House Chorizo Gravy; that's even better with the openfaced Morning Cuban than the green house salsa.   Oh; speaking of house; they were playing some nice jazzy/soulful house music while I was there. Pretty nice for atmosphere. They alternated between the jazzy house and bossa nova music while I was there. I wasn't sure if it was a mix from their private collection; or if it was just Pandora.   Either way; big ups for good tasting food and good taste in music.  The peanut butter brownies are good; but the rest of the baked goods didn't interest me. I think 5th St Bakehouse's strength lies not in the baked goods; but in their awesome sandwiches like the Morning Cuban. In fact; I want to go there right now! [REVIEW_13] I was very disappointed with the cake I ordered. I picked it up at the shop. The service was very slow and I paid for the cake before I picked it up. I sat there for 10-15 minutes just for someone to wrap a bow around the already boxed cake. I ordered the White and Black Cake. The icing was not sweet at all and it was greasy. The cake was heavy and did not have much of a flavor. The cake was certainly not worth $70. [REVIEW_14] We came here few times as we live at the corner. We loved our previous orders but not the one we made last week. At first it was a little burn; not a big deal; I won't eat the part where it's burn; but after a bite; I noticed something wrong.   We ordered the same than usual and this time I didn't get why I was expected. I didn't get a tomato sauce base as I had on my last orders. It was very frustrating. We went back to explain there was a mistake on our order as there is no tomato sauce so we wanted our order to be right.   They were very rude about it and refused to make another one saying that what I ordered doesn't have any tomato sauce! What a surprise because I ordered it a couple of month ago and I got it with tomato sauce. We were obviously bothering them on a quiet night.  Of course; what I ate was super dry without the tomato sauce and the burning!!! I won't go back here anymore! It's a shame how they talked to us. Terrible customer service and rude people. [REVIEW_15] I have had several bad experiences with the Montgomery county SPCA. I never thought to look up reviews until now.  The woman who I believe may have been previously employed there pretty much nailed it. A few years ago I went to one of the branches trying to rescue a severely underweight Neapolitan mastiff. They told me verbatim that they wouldnt cat or dog test her and they go by the typical behavior of the breed.  They said it was a liability if one of the dogs or cats in the meet got injured.  That being said; the dog wouldn't be adopted out to a home with cats.  They also told me under no circumstances would they adopt out a pit bull mix to a home with other animals  That left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. They weren't even willing to work with me to save this dog.  This weekend we stopped into a different branch and fell in love with one of the pit bull mixes they had there.  Her kennel card said she was good with kids and dogs as she previously lived with both. She had been turned in about 48 hour prior to our visit due to the fact that her family was moving and couldn't bring her.  We Inquired about her at the reception area where they were MORE than friendly and eager to give us as much information as possible.  They had said she actually hadnt  had a behavior evaluation by a manager yet and that they expected that to happen within the next few days.  They also made a comment that since she was an am staff mix she would require an application. I found that to be a bit weird and wondered to myself if either of the 2 small dogs that tried to rip my head off would require the same. So; unable to control my excitement; I called today to see if she had her behavior test and to set up a meet with my resident dog. The woman said she had failed her evaluation and was no longer up for adoption.  She wasn't allowed to give me any additional information. We were heart broken. I feel like maybe if we were informed of her issues we could decide if it was something we were able to rehabilitate. I didn't understand why she had a kennel card with her information if she hadnt even been evaluated. Again; the staff there were more than willing to help and very pleasant. Even the woman on the phone thanked me for calling in.  I love the SPCA and all they stand for; but I feel like the Montgomery county SPCA is less tolerant of any kind of behavior issues and are more willing to euthanize for space rather than work with a dog whos issues may be minor. [REVIEW_16] One star isn't even low enough for how I am feeling right now. Wings over broadway use to be my favorite wing stop in Tucson until recently when we ordered 16 boneless wings.   We were DISGUSTED to find what appears to be parts of a worm inside of our wings. Usually service is alright. But that night they also happened to have the lady who appeared to be a manager lecturer one of her cooks for 10 minutes while people piled up at the counter for the one waitress on staff room orders and ran food to tables.   Needless to say; I will not be returning. And I truly do wish many others see this review and do not return as well. I spent 30 some dollars on horrible service and disgusting food. [REVIEW_17] Stood in line and were ignored. The host proceeded to seat his friends who were clearly standing behind us before asking if we had been helped. [REVIEW_18] Lame waitress!  I came to watch 10 mins of a game before catching my train. The bartender asked if I wanted a drink. I said no; just catching the game. He was cool. The bar was barely 1/3 rd full and slow.  So I quietly sat at a high top and a waitress came by and asked if I wanted a drink. I said I had a train in 10 mins etc. She said I couldn't sit there and had to leave the bar.  Huh? I looked around and saw half of her high top tables were empty.  I was dressed like the other patrons and was about to leave anyway.  I said why? I'm not taking someone's seat. She got prissy and said they were the rules. Really??? I get it if it's busy. Or if you have a homeless person stinking up the bar. But seriously; I'm just some dude sitting there quietly who's about to leave. That's an issue? Will be avoiding this bar for 2015. [REVIEW_19] Completely unprofessional. The guy bills me for the right tire chains and gives me the wrong product. I had to find out last minute. The chains did not fit. I had to hassle around town to find one. Their concerns had nothing to do with my needs but making sure that they maintain correct inventory level at another store in Chatsworth (which is where I had to go to swap them). Check what these guys give you. [REVIEW_20] This place is terrible. Terrible service; terrible food; and the place is dirty beyond reason.  Really hope I don't have food poisoning after eating here; but I wouldn't bet on it.",2
6,"[REVIEW_1] Picked up takeout from Village Whiskey (so I can't review the actual restaurant). The Whiskey Burger is pricy ($26) but is amazing if you're ok with a greasier burger. Super tender; the bacon is awesome and it's pretty big. If you can get past the price then highly recommend it. The Duck Fat fries are also rich and delicious. [REVIEW_2] I live in central NJ.  Tried to make deal on '16 Genesis locally.  Had negative equity Kia Optima lease that was complicating the deal.  No local deals to be had.  Enter Kyle Hill of Fred Beans. The most professional; creative; likeable; and honest car salesman I've ever dealt with.  Made the deal work that nobody else even gave a chance; and located the exact color I wanted.  My Kia went away as well and my new payment was right where I wanted it.  Can't say enough about Kyle and the professional feel of the dealership.  I've read a lot of negative reviews here...I guess every deal stands on its own.  But; for me; nothing but rave reviews. No problem traveling to Doylestown.  Ask for Kyle. [REVIEW_3] A friend and I were visiting PA for the first time this Memorial Day weekend.  We were in pursuit of a good place to eat.  We passed Han Dynasty and like the ambience. We decided to give it a try. We sat at the bar area. The two gentlemen working the bar were extremely helpful and welcoming. They explained the menu to us. Everything is cooked fresh.  We love spicy food. The hotter the better; the food was so amazingly flavorful I would drive back from Washington; DC just to eat here again. I had the Cumin Pork spiced to level 10 my friend had chicken fried rice. We like very hot food most places even in DC cannot get the balance of heat and flavor right even when dishes are request extra spicy. Han Dynasty did!! The customer service and the food are worth giving this place a try if you like spicy food.  It would be a great business move for them if they opened one in the District of Columbia. Well done guys!! [REVIEW_4] Great wine bar to people watch and enjoy a day or night out!  Take your girlfriends or a date. [REVIEW_5] New owners bring true pride of ownership.  The place is small but had pretty much all you need.  If you are looking for a small; less busy; no screaming muscle monsters; check out this place.  Open 24 hrs.  Price is about $30/ month.  I will never go back to LA Fitness.     New owner Mike is fantastic.  He just painted the inside and front of the building himself.  The place is meticulous and he is friendly and knowledgeable.  You just can't beat what you get for the money.  Plus; it's open all the time for members.   Now we that is convenient! [REVIEW_6] I had the pleasure of volunteering for this one in 2016 Military Park. Venue tents were well spread out which helped control the crowds and your line wait. This was a step ahead of a somewhat cramped street styled BrewHaHa. Having the chance to try home brewers was a special treat. Brewers were polite and willing to describe the products in detail. The good indy notable SunKing offered special blends on a timed schedule; which gave you something to shoot for every hour. If you are a true fan; brewers even offer swag at a seemingly discounted price from online! Summertime events like these is what makes living in Indianapolis so much more enjoyable. Go northside! [REVIEW_7] My favorite Starbucks! The employees are excellent and learn the regulars. However the parking kind of stinks but that's not their fault. [REVIEW_8] Just left here and every single person had a warm smile on their face.  Love this place!  Great food consistently too.  I will definitely go back - even with the construction it's worth it. [REVIEW_9] Worst service ever.  Won't be back.  Cooked sushi was over cooked and dry.  Waiter took our order and never put it in.  Sat for 20 min. Before we could get his attention and ask. [REVIEW_10] I thought this burger joint was phenomenal! I ordered a chicken burger with pepper jack; bacon; guacamole; pico and ranch and the flavors were excellent. The chicken was AMAZING. I also thought our waiter was very attentive and helped with recommendations as well. This is a very cute/ hip place that seemed filled with the typical gluten free hipster but I really enjoyed it! [REVIEW_11] Nice Experience!!  We had quiche and Joe's scramble and a Lemmon muffin; all excellent.  The bottomless mimosas were wonderful and the waitstaff kept them coming.  Such a great start to Saturday.  The remodel was well worth the wait; the place looks fantastic! [REVIEW_12] Service was ok. Good deals. But the staff was very loud and unprofessional. They were the loudest in the restaurant. Eating while working. Just being generally obnoxious. Will not be going back. [REVIEW_13] I loved this place. These tacos were delicious and the salsa options were fantastic.   There isn't much to say. You walk to the counter; order the food; get your salsa from the salsa bar; and chow down.   If you want street tacos; look no further. You've reached the spot. [REVIEW_14] Can't say much more than has already been said; this is the place to get good consistent sushi.  Very friendly service; and once they see you a few times they call out your name as soon as you walk in the door.  I've been going to Osaka for years; and I've never been disappointed; they have a great sushi menu and Thai menu.  There's enough selection on the menu to satisfy most people that aren't big sushi fans.    The specialty sushi roll menu is huge; many original selections and combinations; though I would call these rolls; ""American Sushi"".  They also have a traditional sushi menu; and if you sit at the sushi bar on a slow evening; and they know you; they will let you come up with your own custom roll !  One of my favorite rolls is the ""Sexy Man"" along with the ""Fat Bastard #2"" yes these are real names of their rolls.   About the only thing I could critique is the time to get your sushi order can take over 30 minutes on a really busy evening.  Still way worth the wait; and it gives you an excuse to order more sake !    They're going to be moving at the end of September because the strip center is being torn down for a big CVS; because there's not enough of them around.  It's probably a blessing in disguise because the current location decor is due for a upgrade. [REVIEW_15] Del Air was responsible for setting up our AC in our newly built home. We noticed a rattling sound before we moved in; so the builder called Del Air to come fix it. They said they did and it seems as though they just lowered the speed of the blower for us not to notice the sound. Well two years later; the sound is back. DO NOT USE THESE SCAMMERS! They also wanted us to PAY them for a FREE extension of the warranty. Thanks for nothing Del Air. We will NEVER use you and I have told my community to avoid your company at all costs. [REVIEW_16] This is a great little comic shop and the girl behind the counter was very friendly. Thanks! [REVIEW_17] There's a reason why they're # 1:  They're the Best!  My daughter [a UCSB student] needed a short-term public storage unit because her new apartment wasn't available to move-in; before the lease of her old place expired.  So; I researched online for some local businesses.  Only Public Storage is up front about what they charge for their storage units and their website is user-friendly.  Others claim they have competitive prices; but what does that really mean?  Why don't they all clearly list their price for a particular size unit and tell you if it is available or not; without subjecting you to a sales pitch.  I inquired via their website; but they didn't have the courtesy to reply.  Public Storage was also the closest place to her Apt.; UCSB; and offered the best deal too.  With their ""$1 for the 1st month promo"" it was a no-brainer decision.  Public Storage has got their act together and are very professional.  Does the competition allow you to reserve a unit without making a deposit?  Before I was finished registering online for their ""Express Check-In"" during the reservation process; their manager Kristine called to welcome me and answer any question that I might have.  That's impressive.  They also sent a written confirmation restating the size of the unit; your preference [of indoor vs. drive-up access]; the cost; and your move-in date.   When we were ready to move into the unit; Manny was our on-site team member; and he made the process hassle-free.  It was ready; and I had a choice of several that were available.  F.Y.I.; if you want to keep a mattress clean; then buy one of their giant plastic storage bags.  Their office is well stocked with essential supplies and padlocks too; if you didn't have one already.  Moving out was just as easy; if not easier.  We came when it was convenient for us and left the unit clean and unlocked overnight.  I notified Public Storage online of our move-out.  They inspected the unit; closed out our account; and sent me a receipt.  [I didn't even need to re-visit the place; but did since I was in the area a few days later.  I just wanted to tell Kristine and Henry; who greeted me; what a pleasure it was doing business with them.  I would highly recommend Public Storage and would without hesitation; re-use them again; if the need arises. [REVIEW_18] I've always heard great things about their groothie so I tried it. It was giving me a smoothie-gasm. Love it. But then one time it was served room-temperature and it was awkward...which was off putting to me because I don't really like warm smoothies; though other people may not mind. Personally; I think I pay good money for this; so it bothered me. I came back another day for another try; and I realized I fell in love with the groothie when it's chilled. I've yet to try their other goods! I like the vibe of the place itself though. Lots of positivity :) [REVIEW_19] I've been to this place in numerous occasions and I have never been disappointed! My friend and I are traveling to Puerto Rico and my mother in law wanted Tamales! They were very accommodating and gave us free samples and offer to cook them and pack them for us! Great place and very friendly staff! [REVIEW_20] Just had my first Panera delivery experience and it was great! The delivery was on time and the nicest delivery guy I've ever met delivered my lunch! He was friendly and polite and seemed like he was having his best day ever! Max delivered great food with a contagious smile! Good stuff Panera!",17
7,"[REVIEW_1] I would give this place negative stars if possible... and I would like to know when people actually went here!? Where were the short lines? The brilliant employees who made jokes and whimsically processed your organized paperwork? Where were the birds singing merrily?   1. There are never any parking spaces in the small parking lot.  2. The people here are the rudest people I have ever come across; and that factors in for the fact that they have to work at the DMV and deal with idiots all day  Let's see --first visit the person at the front desk turned me away because I didn't know you needed to bring a personal check or money order and wouldn't even let me get a number if didn't show her I had all my documents were ready to be processed- well I thought;  ok the website doesn't say you only take checks but OK; this is my fault and they mean business here!   Second visit I was told the wait was 2 hours - they are only open during the hours I work 8:30-4:30 so basically you have to miss work to go to the location in South Philly. I had to go back to work so I; yet again; assumed it was on me to figure out how to do this the right way. I'll try again; I told myself.  Third visit I was prepared - I had all my paperwork--took 2 hours off work- and I was told the wait was 1 hour 23 minutes. I'm going to do this!! I was number 748 and they were on number 730 when I sat down. Score! Over an hour later; the TWO people working there had only gotten through 4 people. One woman spent the whole time waiting on the same person who looked like he handed her a paperclip and a plastic bag and she made all kinds of calls to try to get his documentation (remember I can't even get in the building without showing mine)... the other person working there; while he was moving at a faster pace; took 2 people in a row who didn't have numbers. Then a man came over and said ""My sister so and so is coming"" and the woman nodded. 15 minutes later; the line hadn't moved at all and just before the man called the next number (number 735- still nowhere near me ) a woman comes up and announces she is so and so's sister and with no number; no line; no waiting; gets to go and give her paperwork in and was promptly waited on. Now; after 90 minutes and the line only moving 5 people my patience was wearing very thin. I complained about what was going on and I was told that ""oh honey those people were here earlier and lost their numbers"" OH YEA RIGHT. Then the woman finishes with ""paperclip no documents man"" and announces she is ""going on break"" and gets up and walks around and starts playing with so and so's sister's baby while she gets waiting on and the rest of us sit there like total fools.   I left and will never go back. If you no choice but to go to this location; take a day off work and get there as soon as they open. Also know that your number means nothing and the wait will be over 2 hours. And no one will be nice. Or try and make friends with someone who works there and that way you don't even need a number. [REVIEW_2] I had called at 630 tonight to see what time they were open until tonight due to the snow. I was told 10. I got there at 830 and even with a packed restaurant they would not seat us because 'they close at 9 tonight' why was I told 10? I also drove about 15-20 min just to get there so waste of time and gas. The fact we were turned away is rude and unprofessional; I get the early closing but maybe  they should inform the girl answering the phone. [REVIEW_3] Don't shop here! The main manager here is a total bitch; I wore a pair of Levi shoes to school for one class; the shoes tore into the back of my heel to the point of bleeding and blistering; I went to return the item and was told I could not; even after explaining that we had asked the return policy BEFORE buying the shoes; to which the employee only told us we had 30 day; which is complete LIE; you have 30 days if they are totally unworn... how are you supposed to tell if the quality of the shoe is okay if you don't ware them? What if the glue peels or they completely fall apart? You are suckered into buying them and then you are told you are completely SOL if the shoe is of very bad quality. The manager needs to be fired; no managerial skills whatsoever; who trained her; Hiter? Again I strongly urge you to buy shoes from a better store! [REVIEW_4] Only giving one star because I'm required to give A star in order to leave a review.   First; rude employees. We were never greeted; never acknowledged; while multiple employees came to the station in front of us and then walked away. No one even looked up at us. As we were about to walk out; someone finally stood there and looked at us. Not sure if she actually said anything; but we gave her our order anyway.   Food quality was BAD! The pinto beans were cold. The brisket was not warm; but I wouldn't call them quite cold. I looked for their health score but didn't see it posted anywhere. Maybe the lack of one should have been a sign.  Yeah; we won't be back. Like ever. With so many other restaurants in this shopping center; there are too many good choice to settle for food and service this bad. Save yourself the trouble and go next door to Panera; or Fulins; or Longhorn. Heck; even go buy you a candy bar from Target before choosing to eat here. You'll be glad you did. [REVIEW_5] Nice to receive a message from Kerry @ the Whole Foods team. Promised to send a gift card due to the bad sausage. Never received. Guess she is just a person who pretends they care. [REVIEW_6] Food is not bad (i.e.; standard Cosi glorified fast food).  However this particular restaurant has the rudest employees I have ever met in my life.  Asking for a fork is a huge burden on them for which I must apologize.  I am SO sorry I need a fork to eat a salad.  Also the workflow here is weird.  They act like you're a huge idiot for not knowing you order salad at one end and soup at the registers.  Signs might help.  Tomato basil was dec though. [REVIEW_7] The worst body shop ever. They will blame you for their mistake. Don't go here if you have a Mercedes or BMW.  Honestly they did a good job on the paint but they are careless. They scratched up my leather seats; drain my battery; and my panels is not installed right. [REVIEW_8] I absolutely loved this place when i first started and still do but won't be going back.  They did not honor something they told me they would. I won't go into much detail as they know the problem. I don't know what happened in the last few months but it is completely gone down fast. They are unorganized and all over the place. They got rid of their best trainers. They don't seem to be very loyal to their older clients that have been there since day 1. [REVIEW_9] $150 admin fee and $40 a month for a tiny gym that is barely ever open? No thanks. [REVIEW_10] There is nothing like the other pics showed!!! I never give out review on Yelp; but I had to comment on this restaurant! I am a sushi lover; the fish was poorly cut and the sushi rice is tasteless. The dynamite we had was extremely salty and loads of mayos. I took one bite left the rest on the table. This is the worst experience l've ever had in a 4.5 star restaurant; please avoid at all cost!!! [REVIEW_11] Our second time we ordered from this place.  We placed an order at 600 told us it would be about 45 minutes. One pizza one order of fries and a hoagie and a bottle of Diet Coke. It's now 715 and a girl comes to our door with my husbands sandwich which the driver forgot to take with our order and asks if we got our food yet?  My husband said no we didn't.  Another half hour goes by and the kid brings us the pizza and fries which are ice cold.  Then asks him if he got his soda and again we said no. He said he would be right back;  1/2 hour longer he finally comes with it after we have already tried to eat the cold horrible food. Now I know I should ha e gone to pick it up since we are only right down the road but wanted to spend time with my grandson and have a great night.  It's pretty bad when a 6 year old won't even eat the pizza which by the way is his favorite.  NEVER AGAIN!  Wasted 30.00!!!!! [REVIEW_12] Save your money!! The food taste like cheap buffet food....very bland!! Even the mac and cheese was terrible. Only think we enjoyed was the live music. [REVIEW_13] This place is NASTY! . Floors; booths; sides of booths are caked with old food. Service was slow at best. Baked potato tasted like it had been baked 3 days ago. Will NEVER go there again. [REVIEW_14] I went when they first opened and I didn't want to judge too harshly because it's a new place. I waited several weeks to try again; even worse!! We came for a show with a band and sat at a high top table by the bar. Nobody came by to say hi or ask about drinks. We waited 15 minutes and still not service; I get it; it's busy. So I go to the bar. The bartender is busy with other guest; she says she will be right with me; 15 mins later still haven't been helped. The manager is very present and visible the whole time.  He is yelling at servers and comparing about not doing their jobs. But he doesn't even notice that I have not been helped yet. Finally another bartender helps me and I walk my drinks back to my party. Still nobody has come by our table. We were there for a while and no server has come by and the manager was very oblivious to our distaste or the fact we needed help. On top of that; there was crazy feedback on the music and you couldn't even hear the singing. We finished our beers and went elsewhere. Very disappointing. [REVIEW_15] I have had several bad experiences with the Montgomery county SPCA. I never thought to look up reviews until now.  The woman who I believe may have been previously employed there pretty much nailed it. A few years ago I went to one of the branches trying to rescue a severely underweight Neapolitan mastiff. They told me verbatim that they wouldnt cat or dog test her and they go by the typical behavior of the breed.  They said it was a liability if one of the dogs or cats in the meet got injured.  That being said; the dog wouldn't be adopted out to a home with cats.  They also told me under no circumstances would they adopt out a pit bull mix to a home with other animals  That left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. They weren't even willing to work with me to save this dog.  This weekend we stopped into a different branch and fell in love with one of the pit bull mixes they had there.  Her kennel card said she was good with kids and dogs as she previously lived with both. She had been turned in about 48 hour prior to our visit due to the fact that her family was moving and couldn't bring her.  We Inquired about her at the reception area where they were MORE than friendly and eager to give us as much information as possible.  They had said she actually hadnt  had a behavior evaluation by a manager yet and that they expected that to happen within the next few days.  They also made a comment that since she was an am staff mix she would require an application. I found that to be a bit weird and wondered to myself if either of the 2 small dogs that tried to rip my head off would require the same. So; unable to control my excitement; I called today to see if she had her behavior test and to set up a meet with my resident dog. The woman said she had failed her evaluation and was no longer up for adoption.  She wasn't allowed to give me any additional information. We were heart broken. I feel like maybe if we were informed of her issues we could decide if it was something we were able to rehabilitate. I didn't understand why she had a kennel card with her information if she hadnt even been evaluated. Again; the staff there were more than willing to help and very pleasant. Even the woman on the phone thanked me for calling in.  I love the SPCA and all they stand for; but I feel like the Montgomery county SPCA is less tolerant of any kind of behavior issues and are more willing to euthanize for space rather than work with a dog whos issues may be minor. [REVIEW_16] ABSOLUTE CRAP!!!! I swiched after one night to the Hotel Intercontinental a REAL hotel!... The rooms are straight from the '70's no renovation. The happy hour was a JOKE and the food was groosssss. UGH [REVIEW_17] BEWARE before you are the next victim! Firestone burned out a cylinder  in a brand new starter on a 2004 Mercedes Benz C230; by the mechanics that dont know what they are doing costing me an extra $500.00 plus; $460.00; with an alternator from AUTO ZONE which is no good and don't last long. I had the starter replaced at Kaufman about a year ago. I have contacted 8 ON MY SIDE and BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU for an investigation on  these dishonest and untruthful employee at Firestone. The car started 3 times at Firestone location with no issues with my starter; after being towed.. The next day I had received a call from an employee about my car's starter was smoking after they repaired an alternator and battery. I wonder what Firestone did to my car.  I had reported that an alternator that was done at Firestone was giving lot of problem 6 months ago; with no help and resolution. I will NEVER return to any Firestone or Firestone on Bruce B. Downs and I am disappointed and filing a complaint for justice. [REVIEW_18] Beware that this place charges $18 per day for parking and a ""resort fee"" of $15 for internet access; 2 bottles of water a day and on line access to a newspaper site. I reserved our room on line; and only found out about these fees when looking at the reviews on yelp when trying to find if any of the restaurants in the resort were worth trying. I called and spoke to a manager on duty about these fees and she refused to refund the fees since I checked the terms and conditions box on the reservations page. I informed the MOD that I had neglected to read all of the terms and conditions; therefore she refused to help. After returning home I looked at the terms and conditions on the reservations page; where the check box appears and indeed it does tell of the $15 resort fee; but fails to mention the $18 parking fee.   This room was $250 per night before taxes. The room was nothing special. I've stayed in La Quinta Inns and other places that were just as nice; if not better; for far less.   I also was left wondering what happened to the southern hospitality that us southerners are supposed to be so well known for.  When I pay $250 a night for a room; I don't expect to be charged exorbitant fees for things I get for free at far less expensive hotels. [REVIEW_19] They guy behind the counter is not friendly or trustworthy; I had a feeling that they were trying to rip me off. I should haver read the reviews on yelp before going there. You would be better off going somewhere else. [REVIEW_20] So I have this problem in life.  For whatever reason; I like to grow my hair out as big and as untidy as possible.  My thick locks are wavy and what many would classify as ""unkempt"" when allowed to grow freely.  Not to say that my hair is dirty because I do wash it every day; but I just like the way my hair looks and feels when it is a booming mop.  There are other factors in life that when coupled with my lion's mane develop issues that need to be dealt with.  For one- I work at a financial institution; and as much as I would love to say that the world has developed into an open-minded; physical-appearances-don't-matter type of place (where everyone holds hands; endlessly sings lovable Cat Stevens songs; and skips along in unison); the reality is you all are a bunch of judgmental 'yotches who for some reason DO care about how my hair looks and think that it somehow makes me incapable of doing my job...  Well; maybe not *you*...  But definitely you there!  This ""feature"" of society (the part about judging a book by its cover) is multiplied 10-fold by the simple fact that I come from the Midwest.  OK- Chicago is cool and contemporary and all; but it still is the Midwest folks!  Or maybe I am the one that is delusional?  Maybe I just look rank with my wildin' out; big ass hair?  After all; it is my beautiful and fashionable wife who delicately reminds me a few times a year that my hair is; after all; something that needs care and styling; or at least a good hacking to.  Probably more care than the fine ladies at Hair Cuttery are capable (or more likely WILLING) of giving.  Which brings me to Dapper.  A friend of mine was raving about the job that these ladies do.  I pride myself in being quite open-minded; but was surprised to hear that it was a ""full-blown"" barber shop run by some tattooed punk rock ladies; ala roller derby style.  Where they offer complimentary beer and pool games while you wait for a chair to open up.  This alone wasn't enough to shock me; but the fact that it came from this particular friend.  What I mean to say is that if there was anyone in the world that I would guess did not give a crap about where he got his hair cut; it would be him.  He has had the same hair cut for over 15 years- military style.  So why go here; a hip place; clearly catered to those that are looking to pay a lot for a good haircut in a unique setting?  He then tells me because a cut is only going to cost $15.  To start the trip off; my hair was beyond the point where my wife was going to tolerate it much further.  I was at the ""wing"" stage; where the hair around my ear begins to uncontrollably flip up and look as if I did it on purpose with a hot curling iron or something (childhood evidence: http://static1.px.yelp.com/photo/YaQT9rb_q7LgQRD5Lhg8AQ/l ).    Winter in Chicago was coming!  I needed natural ear muffs!  As you can imagine- this ""excuse"" only goes so far.  So in I go; with wife in tow (I'm a poet and didn't even know it!).  We arrived only a short while before closing and I timidly asked if it was cool for me to still get a cut.  ""Of course!"" was the response; ""have a seat over there; help yourself to whatever is in the fridge and someone will be right with you!""  Hoping that they would turn me away for coming in too late; or without an appointment or whatever; I walked my shaggy self over to a couch and waited; stroking my long locks one last time before losing them (and about 5 pounds- my hair gets huge).  I was shortly called over by Jo; a fellow Illinoisan (is that what we are supposed to call ourselves?) by upbringing; who called me over and asked what I wanted.  ""I need a haircut; but don't really want one.""  After figuring out why I didn't want one (and agreeing with me; probably more out of kindness and empathy) she let me know I would be in good hands and that she would make things right.  Hair washed; and she goes into cutting.  Old-school style.  The way I remember getting it as a kid.  Nothing but scissors and straight razor.  No clippers (which I usually ask for a #3) with my cut.  And yet she got my noggin looking sharp; but still with some length and good shape.  Wings gone; or more like trimmed back; or tucked in or something.  I don't know how to describe the cut- but it looked really good!  Especially after the initial shock of losing my beloved; over-sized helmet; and realizing that I COULD in fact get my hair cut short and still have it look pretty good- and not have to spend a ton of money to do so!  And as for Jo- AWESOME.  She kept the conversation going and was into some really cool stuff!  I walked out with some weight off of my shoulders (figuratively and literally); and money left in my pocket.  Not to mention a very happy wife; who happened to start her night of drinking off the right way with a complimentary beer from that fridge.  Thanks Jo!  Wish you all were up here in Chicago...  I am sure for the same amount of dope service; I will be dropping $50.",1
8,"[REVIEW_1] I love this place and it's a shame that it's never beer busy when I come here. Their food is amazing and the owners and staff are so friendly and attentive! This is my go to bbq place in the area and will always be! The owners live above it and really care about the place. She chatted with us about their catering orders; so that's something you may want to consider if you're looking to cater something. They also do carry out and you can call in a carry out order. The daily specials are separate for dining in and carrying out however :) [REVIEW_2] Great service and great food! We had the escovitch fish; oxtails; and curry goat. Everything was wonderful. I highly recommend trying Flambo for yourself because you will become a repeat customer. It truly is an experience. [REVIEW_3] I finally tried this place tonight. It was very quiet. Which i love when i want to carry a conversation. Josh was our server; what a great guy; on the ball; very informative; no is not in hos vocabulary.  Got mussels marinara as an app.  I have never seen so many mussels on 1 plate. I swear it must have been 3 lbs. And they were all as plump. All of our food huge portions and delish. Dessert was over the top. Its my new fav. Italian restaurant. Cant wait to go back [REVIEW_4] I'm always a little nervous trying new salons... I'm picky with what is done to my hair; however I was pleasantly surprised!! Matt did an awesome job and really listened to what I wanted. My hair was different colors (in a bad way) because of too many bleach blond high-lites. Matt made it look much more natural and actually listened when I asked for just a trim (instead of taking off too much). The price was a little steep but I did get full color. I will be back! [REVIEW_5] The Mona Lisa Lounge is an awesome spot and gem here in Louisiana. My boyfriend and I stopped to have a couple drinks before our swamp tour. Not only were we greeted with the best southern hospitality the service; food; and drinks were superb. The Bourdain and seafood balls were incredible. The cook came out to serve us personally. We were given beads and plenty of great conversation. The owner Tony was personable and genuinely wanted us to enjoy ourselves and that we did. This will become a staple in my visits to Louisiana. [REVIEW_6] First of all; I can't believe this place is FREE!!!!  If I lived nearby; I'd be here almost every day. So much fun for little kids. I would have easily paid $3 to get in.   In fact; I recommend you guys start charging and hire some more staff. The toys need to be cleaned and so do the slides. [REVIEW_7] I had Hahka Kitchens do my kitchen remodel and could not be happier.  The process was so smooth from the moment I walked in ""just to get a rough estimate"" to the finish. They couldn't be nicer people to work with.  Linda is a great designer and Randy is an excellent contractor.  We came up with several solutions to things that I didn't care for.  I love the cabinets I choose with the door style and finish.  The hardest selection to make was the Cambria quartz countertop and they were very patient in ordering larger samples of a number of options.  My kitchen remodel turned into a kitchen remodel with new flooring and a few changes in the bathroom and Randy was happy to answer all of my questions. The Ocampo brothers did excellent work installing the cabinets and hardware.  They were so pleasant to have working in my home and were very careful when installing my appliances. [REVIEW_8] I work in the shopping center and was eager to try the new restaurant.  I didn't expect it to be so amazing! The atmosphere is really nice but it's the food that really hits it out of the field.. I had the Penne Sausage and it was probably the best pasta dish I have ever had.  My boyfriend had the Alfredo (which of course I tried) and it was delicious; creamy and buttery. I very much enjoyed the house salad. Don't change a thing! I could sit and eat that bread and olive oil all day if you let me =P Big portions; great service.  I really hope they stick around! [REVIEW_9] My family has been going here for years and loves it. They have wonderful bread and a salad that is to die for. Also; fettucini is yummy as well and chicken parmigiana. Also love their cappuccino freeze dessert. Please go! Yum [REVIEW_10] The carnitas (pork) tacos were incredible. So juicy; with such excellent corn tortillas. Additionally; the tres leches cake was delightful. It also wasn't too expensive compared to some upscale restaurants.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant. [REVIEW_11] The food here is great. They're quick and the staff is so nice; seriously. I always feel welcome when I place my order here. [REVIEW_12] Our son & his wife sent us the heart shaped box of chocolate covered strawberries with a 'Happy Anniversary' balloon for our 50th wedding anniversary this past Saturday. The store called to make sure we were home; the driver wished us a happy anniversary and the strawberries are still delicious and keeping well in the fridge. I would definitely send these to someone else. Well worth the price. [REVIEW_13] I went to this salon to get the devacut which is dry cutting for naturally curly hair and I came out in love! My stylist was Mario he did an amazing job on my hair. I have dry; thin 3a 3b hair and he knew exactly what to do. He did my cut which I needed badly and diffused and used Devachan products. Love it!! Thanks Mario!  *You have curly hair? Get your hair cut here!* [REVIEW_14] New favorite spot in Reno! Best muscles I've had in a sushi joint. Great menu options that aren't the same old rolls everywhere else has. The flavored sake drinks are good but extremely sweet; so be forewarned. Don't hesitate to check this place out. Great atmosphere and the best sushi! [REVIEW_15] Food is bomb.  Plus good servers.  Right by river.  You have nothing to lose and everything to gain by eating here. [REVIEW_16] Wow!!  That really sums up; in a very good way; my interactions with Delicious Designs and Leigh Anne!  Our wedding was only planned two months out and was supposed to be very very small so no cake was needed.  As the weeks went by; the guest list increased; so I decided I wanted a cake.  With probably less than a weeks notice; Leigh Anne stepped up and made the exact cake I had in my head.  I asked for a simple two tier lemon cake with no decorations.  Not only did she make this happen beautifully; she made chocolate vegan cupcakes for my daughter at the last minute.    I'm attaching a picture of the cake ""table"".  My daughter did the decorating and I must say; for someone with not much in the decorating department; everything came out better than I could ever imagine.  And not only was the cake perfect; it was yummy delicious.  I can't wait for my one year anniversary to dig in to that top layer!   If you are in need of any bakery needs in Reno and you don't use Leigh Anne with Delicious Designs; well then all I can say is I'm sorry! [REVIEW_17] I have never ever been this satisfied with a repair facility!!! They absolutely positively go above and beyond my expectations every time I need a repair on my Jetta. From the girl who answers the phone who was super nice and friendly to the service writer Alex who explained everything in detail and gave me all the options so I could decide which way was best for me. No pressure; excellent prices; perfect repair and the car was done days ahead of schedule. I cannot be more satisfied!!!! [REVIEW_18] Perfect place to celebrate my birthday. Everything from the service to the robust/perfectly seasoned food to the warm and rustic ambiance... Simply amazing. [REVIEW_19] Love this place! The staff is super friendly and the food is good. I usually order the vegetarian caprese sandwich w asparagus and strawberries. On a hot day; make sure to check out their icee stand in the back. [REVIEW_20] This place is a little slice of Heaven. Fresh and homemade cheeses; pasta; pastries; sandwiches as well as a ton of homemade food to take home. Huge wine selection. I can't say enough good things about Mazzaros! I go at least once a week. The first time you go can be a little overwhelming because it is usually very busy. Just ask someone who looks like they know what they are doing and they will lead you where you need to go.",20
9,"[REVIEW_1] Horrible!  I heard good things about this salon and went in last year before vacation for a gel mani and regular pedi.  I purchased my own tools so that I didn't have to worry about contamination from other feet.  The technicians kept using old files and buffers despite the fact that I paid for my own tools (and purchased them from their salon).  When I tried to tell them I had my own; they didn't understand (language barrier) and I had to keep calling over the manager.  I did not want to seem annoying but I also did not want to get an infection.  Well.....  My gel mani chipped within 2 days of being on vacation and I got a fungal infection on two of my toe nails.  NEVER; EVER again!  I never go to nail salons for this exact reason and not I am stuck with fungus.  Please do not go to this nail salon. [REVIEW_2] One reason why the poor review; the way they handled a news release from the New Orleans Sewage and Water Board. We are not to use water to bathe; brush teeth; drink or rinse food. The Wyndham has many foreign tourists here that may not be able to understand the the Special News Release that was put under everyone's door. I did ask for more water and was handed 2 small bottles. They refused to let me check out early. [REVIEW_3] Ordered pizza and tipped a buck. Made wrong pizza...waited...made another wrong pizza...girl talked to manager and walked into back room with pizza and suddenly came out with the right sauce and already had cheese already on it. Don't know what happened in the back room but I thought they were supposed to make it in front of you. Then they treated me like I was the asshole. [REVIEW_4] The service was great all around; very professional. The food is excellent in quality and to taste.  I had a cheesteak; it was the best in the neighborhood and very good.  Best vanilla milkshake like ever.  I've been searching for a great pizzeria down here for the longest. Every where else everything is impossibly greasy; the food is old...blah blah.  Salernos is far from disgusting.  Worth every penny. [REVIEW_5] The setting is great; has a modern feel to it. The food is pretty good some of it is a bit spicy. The reason I'm giving it such a low rating is because the waiters there are extremely rude; don't clean; and demand you tip them more after already leaving a 20% tip. [REVIEW_6] One of the worst service experience. I ordered egg roll and the pho. Egg rolls came out covered with burn crumbles all over and very drak color of the shell and you could the content pretty much black color as if it was almost burned or at the least fried in the last drop of over used burned oil and I could not posssibly put it in my mouth. When I was explaining that Im concerned things are too burned; the owner lady walked up and snatched the plate away from me without saying anything. I did not know if they ate bringing another one or not. Only after I grabbed my waiter later he said they are not making another one ans would take it off my check.  Absolutely rude; not communicating; disrespectful of their customers..  the only reason I came was because the neighboring miss saigoin restaurant was flooded but I think it's worth a wait compared to this place if I want to spend any money for pho and walk out feeling happy :( [REVIEW_7] I went to see Dr. Taylor because a friend recommended him.  He did appear knowledgeable in many areas but did not listen to or honor the reasons for my visit.  Being a naturopath; he is familiar with both natural and allopathic methods of treatment.  Although his staff said he was familiar with the neurological issues I was asking about; he did little to discuss them with me.  He also did not ask if I wanted a more natural or allopathic approach.  He sent me out the door with an allopathic prescription for something he could have easily addressed with a natural approach.  When I called to cancel my follow up appointment; his staff was curt and dismissive and attempted to make me feel badly about cancelling.  He is not someone I would seek out if I was looking for a kind; respectful medical practitioner. [REVIEW_8] Probably made the bad decision of coming here for lunch. Looking at the reviews here; should have tried it out for breakfast. Anyways; figured I'd let others know not to waste their money ordering any of the lunch sandwiches. I seriously think a place like Panera or Potbellys does a better sandwich. [REVIEW_9] The pizza was horrible had to send it back.. Even though we didn't get a new one they tried charging us for it even though we literally only took a bite.. The server avoided talking to us about it and we had to get her attention and she said she will talk to the manager about it and came back making it seem like they were doing us a favor. I do not recommend this place. [REVIEW_10] It always has a strong smell when you open the door plus they aren't friendly or approachable at all.. .I will never go in there again [REVIEW_11] This place continues to deliver excellent food and menu options. It's simple; tastes great; and welcoming environment. We have been coming here for the last 3 years and never had a bad meal. I recently went vegan and the menu has options/ they are will to modify ingredients without any issue. Prices are more than reasonable for the portion and quality. Beer options don't disappoint (even better during happy hour). Here's to keeping it real and local! [REVIEW_12] Wasn't referring to sandwiches ... Was referring to gyro play with  beef rice lettuce and pita bread .... [REVIEW_13] They never shipped the item and its been 18 days. They don't answer their phone or email and after I leave a message; they don't call back. It seems like they are basically running a scam.  I would avoid dealing with them as they do not fulfill their orders or believe in any customer service. [REVIEW_14] Where do I start?  We've been touring the midwest staying exclusively at Homewood Suites over 8 nights in cities ranging from Dallas to Memphis; Chicago; Lexington and now Nashville.  This place is a dump.  The rooms are old and worn.  The kitchen is falling apart; trim falling of the wall; and the whole floor reeks of smoke.  The downstairs lobby was overrun with beer swiggin' Bubbas playing country music and beer pong.  Although we paid for a non smoking 2 bedroom suite; it is clear that our room is not NON-Smoking.  There is no NON-Smoking sign anywhere to be seen; and every other room on our hallway is a smoking room.  To add insult; the front desk tried to argue that hotels are not required to have NON-Smoking signs designating whether the room is or isn't non-smoking.  This is the equivalent of seating a family in the middle of a smoking section in a restaurant; and then claiming that your table is  ""NON Smoking""...  I'm not the type to slam a business with a 1-star review; but this place needs it...  STAY AWAY. [REVIEW_15] Over-priced and poor quality. I bought a 3k couch which took 12 weeks to build from BoConcept in Philly. The couch had structural problems after 3 months! Customer service was very disorganized and communicated very poorly. I would not buy anything from this company again. Horrible support; high prices and poor quality. STAY AWAY! [REVIEW_16] Come here to have drinks made by a bartender who doesn't care about the integrity of their craft!  What seems like a great cocktail program executed by amateurs. Came in the evening of 01/01/18 and ordered a drink that was a floral riff on the Last Word. After straining my drink into the glass; my bartender exchanged baffled looks with his barback and poured gin directly into the glass. I'm not stupid; so I asked what the ingredient was and why he added it after the fact. ""It's lavender Gin and I didn't put enough."" Well; my friend; this resulted in an improperly diluted and room temperature 'cocktail'. I even mentioned that it was not as cold as it should have been and the solution was to add ice to my coupe glass. COME ON. At what point is it appropriate to ask to jump behind the bar and just make your drink yourself?  Just because half the people in NoLA don't know the difference between a good drink and a hole in the ground isn't an excuse to be lazy. Do it right or go home. [REVIEW_17] As a senior; I was looking for a bank for investments.  I wanted to diversify; and not have all my money with Edward Jones which is a great investment company.  When I entered the bank I was ignored.  The employees were chatting.  I had $500;000+ to invest.  I do not know why I was treated this way; but I chose to leave and go else where. [REVIEW_18] Could not get service. I was pass over service twice for customers that ordered was taken immediately after being seated. When I bought to the hostess; that I was at lunch and was pass over. She told that I would have to wait because they was busy. [REVIEW_19] If I could rate them less than one star I would. I had the worst experience here. I felt discriminated against; disrespected; and attacked. The place was over crowded because they over sold tickets. We were asked to move from where we were standing because it would block the dancers from walking by. However; they brought out chairs from the back for other people to sit in that same exact spot. The second time we were asked to move because a couple wanted to sit behind us and couldn't see. A woman then turned a chair around and told one of my friends that the seat wasn't for her in a very rude tone. Next; two girls came in and stood directly in front of me which was also directly in front of the doorway where the dancers were supposed to enter; a server came to us and asked us to move again but said nothing to the two girls. We stated that we could not move where he wanted because then we would be blocking the view of the customers already standing there so he then asked us to move to the back of the bar where we would not be able to see anything. After that the rude woman (who told my friend the seat wasn't for her) had her husband tap my friend and ask could she switch places with me because she was too tall and blocking everyone's view. There was no room for us to switch spots so I said no and continued to try to watch the ""show.""  He then tapped her again and asked did she want to sit down; she said no she was fine. He proceeded by pushing the chair into the back of her legs and forcing her to sit down. There was no staff around to assist us with these issues and there was hardly any room to try to find someone so we left before things got anymore out of hand. As we stood outside getting ready to leave a couple that lived next door overheard us talking about how disrespected we felt they chimed in and said that many of the people there are impolite and rude. I will never again in my life recommend nor visit this establishment. [REVIEW_20] I wish I would have read the reviews before stopping here... I drove in looking to quickly get my tires filled with air because my light was on and I was having a difficult time getting them filled up due to my air valve extensions. I told them this and that I was in a hurry because I had an appointment to get to. I told them I only wanted them to fill up my tires and I didn't need them to do their regular inspection because my car is only 3 years old and had been check just a few months ago before moving here. After waiting nearly an hour I asked the man at the counter how much longer it would be and they took me in to the shop... at this point they told me the sensors in my tires either ""all broke at once or didn't have them in the first place."" The mechanic called two places and told me it would cost $800 to get these installed. I told him I wasn't going to pay that because it's not a necessary expense and I wouldn't be able to afford it. At this point I asked if they had even tried filling up my tires with air; to which he told me no. A different mechanic then filled them up with air and told me that the light probably wouldn't go off because of the ""problem with the sensors."" A mile down the road with full tires the light went off! This was not quick or convenient and I do not appreciate men assuming that I do not know anything about cars in an attempt to get me to spend more money to repair problems that don't even exist!",2
10,"[REVIEW_1] Oh. Mi. Gawd.  Eat. HERE!!!  Don't pass go. Don't collect $200. Eat. HERE!!!!   The bacon is to die for!!  The brûlée-d grapefruit - please can I have this every morning!!!  I got the fig & prosciutto toast. It's all soo soo soo good!!  I don't love breakfast but I may have changed my mind. The wait is a bit long but it is WORTH EVERY freaking second.  Try the champagne mojito for a nice refreshing twist on mimosas!!!   Eat here - have you figured out yet that your mouth and your belly will dance?!?!   Eat. Here!!!! [REVIEW_2] I chose to try this salon out because it was close to home and I needed my solar nails removed and I wanted gel instead. They clearly didn't know how to remove solar as they spent an hour scraping it off after the initial  soak. They proceed to do gel; but she coated my skin more than the nail and after several redos finally finished. A few days later; the gel is coming up. Never will return. [REVIEW_3] I've used this enterprise location for a rental several times (the most recent being 8/20 to 8/29). Each time I've been greeted with a smile which might seem trivial but goes a long way with this girl) and professionalism. Every car I've rented has also been clean which is another win for me. I'd highly recommend this location. [REVIEW_4] Fair Wheel Bikes is likely the most knowlegable road bike pro shops in the country.     Whatever is unique; super-light; ultra-trick; and exotic; fairwheel has the skinny and means to acquire it.  Way beyond the typical realm of bike shops; these guys are unique in every way.  These guys do business worldwide for a good reason. [REVIEW_5] Kids loved this place. Lots to discover and learn. Cost will not break the bank and you can get through it all in about 1.5 to 2 hours. Even the adults in the group enjoyed our time there [REVIEW_6] Read a lot of reviews that mention this is a must see while in Santa Barbara. It certainly was. The architecture and landscaping on the property was beautiful. There is a tower you can climb up to get a 360 view of Santa Barbara.   There were showing free movies in the evenings. [REVIEW_7] Yum yum yum! Salads; pizza and sushi are all great! I don't even love pizza; but I love lulu's olive oil Athenian !! [REVIEW_8] I hurt my back at the gym and was actually pretty worried I really hurt myself but they got me in the next morning and were able to straighten me out. I called around and the pricing; quick service; and location made it an easy choice. Would definitely recommend them to friends and family. [REVIEW_9] The Rincon Beach Club was the PERFECT location for our wedding reception venue. Carol made everything a breeze planning wise. My fiance and I just had to pick and choose what we wanted the place to look like; and Carol exceeded expectations. The food was amazing; the decorations so beautiful; and the photo booth so much fun! With all of the stress that comes with wedding planning; this venue made it so much easier; it is pretty much like a built in wedding planner. The Beach Club is a great indoor/outdoor space that offers a gorgeous and intimate setting; where guests really feel at home. All of our family/friends are still raving about how much fun our wedding was. Thank you so much again Carol; for making it a perfect day. [REVIEW_10] I was here before once. Didn't have much of an impression. I went back again this week with my friends. We were very disappointed. We ordered this grilled whole fish. It came out in a big pot with vegetables looking like left overs. The fish was about the size of one hand; but it only had half of the fish served!!  The dish was $30. We four each took one bite and it was gone! I went home hungry! I ordered a take out for my husband. The serving size was about half of the same dish I ordered from the other Chinese restaurant . I felted being robbed. [REVIEW_11] Worse place and sandwich.  Ordered a steak bomb and a steak and cheese. Bread was dry barely any steak skimped on cheese. They are extremely over priced manager has no want for customer satisfaction . Called them back right after i got home to tell them about my order was told they were closing and couldnt do anything about it that night told me they would talk to manager and have her call me back the following day when I did not receive my call back I called them a girl answered  she said she would have sandwiches  ready when I got there. When i got there to pick them up she says you have to pay for  one  and she was gonna have manager stop by. when she got there she did not care about what I had to say wouldn't refund me do to bad quality of my food she said she only will replace one of them  I told her that its not right they could not fix my order last night because they told me they needed to close the store  and we can fix it the next day which they did not do she had no care to put this right to keep a customer happy and coming back  this place should  be ashamed not only are they ripping people off with there pricing  but the poor quality of food and lack of customer satisfaction   If you want a good steak and cheese and better customer service Richies was good [REVIEW_12] My girlfriend and I decided to try Kalamata's last night at around 7:30. The guy at the counter asked us if we're ready to order even before we had the chance to look at the menu properly; not once but multiple times.   We ordered 2 lamb gyros; a side order of roasted potatoes and the tabouleh. The potatoes came out extremely fast and were lukewarm at best. Either they were premade; and ""microwaved to order"" or were just sitting on a hot plate. Not something I'd expect from any restaurant.   The tabouleh was SOUR - like salad dunked in a bottle of fish sauce sour. We decided to tell the guy upfront our issues with the tabouleh but all we got out of him was ""This is our recipe. This is the way we make it. It's fine if you don't like it; but this is how we make it"". I agree I have no idea what authentic tabouleh tastes like; or how to make it; but I have tasted GOOD tabouleh in the past; and this was far from it. I pity the people who've eaten tabouleh only at this establishment because they're really missing out.   The gyros were pedestrian at best; under-seasoned and most of all under-sauced. The veggies were on one side of the pita; the meat on the other - so you'd never get a mouthful of veggies+meat and only one side of the pocket had the sauce. Suspecting another ""This is how we sauce our gyros. This is our recipe"" moment; we decided to finish our food ASAP.  Finally; the worst offense was that the guy starts closing up shop while we're still eating. Really? I've no idea how this place got 4 stars on yelp; but there are way better restaurants in Nashville for Mediterranean food. [REVIEW_13] WOW!  I come to town once every 4 months and always make sure to stop by here at least once a visit.  That smoked mackerel is just something you can't get anywhere else.  The frosted mug of root beer only makes it better. [REVIEW_14] The manager always goes the extra mile and makes you feel special (without if feeling forced) ..... great food and when I order (using the app) I just leave my store (which is in the mall as well) and it's waiting for when I get there! [REVIEW_15] Got the special--mole chicken.  Terrible. I can't say enough bad things about it. What were they thinking??? [REVIEW_16] We found this hotel on hotel tonight for a total of 123 a night. We had previously stayed at the Castillo Inn at the beach the night before and had a not so great experience; check out my review for that! Anywhoo; the price was cheap for the night of; I would recommend the app to anyone! Great is you want to not be on a schedule or are feeling a little spontaneous. The room was comfy; so was the bed. We wanted a low key night so we walked around the corner to the brew house which is a local bar around the corner and recommended by one of our tour guides. We even rented a movie; free of charge; from the front desk. They had great bathroom products and an excellent brunch in the morning! We will definitely make this our go-to hotel in SB! [REVIEW_17] Awesome family-owned (three generations) A/C company. They are always on-time; courteous; and responsive! Just what you need when it's 100 degrees out and your air shuts off! I love them and will not work with any other company for my A/C repairs; purchases; or installations. Thanks for being great! [REVIEW_18] The restaurant smelled like a toilet.  I couldn't stand it.  My daughter and I got the meals to go and the guy put them in the same box.  She doesn't eat fish and that is what I got.  I know it's a sushi restaurant but she likes the California rolls.  I got the spicy tuna roll.  It was mediocre.  My daughter did enjoyed hers.  Will not be going back. [REVIEW_19] My friend and I split the spinach dip as an app. Dang. As someone who is both stingy and never orders appetizers; this was beyond worth it; folks. Cheesy and warm and all you could ever want.   The Mellowterranean was super delicious as well. We split a medium size and had to be rolled out we were so stuffed.   Great waitstaff and service. Homeboy hypnotized us with his eyes.You win; cute waiter. You win. [REVIEW_20] They have some ridiculous number of martinis featured...I think it's 500 (give or take a 100). They also have petron margaritas; which you can purchase in pitcher form. Let me repeat: GIANT PITCHERS OF PETRON POMEGRANATE MARGARITA GOODNESS! Why are you still sitting there?   Prices are reasonable; but not cheap. That shouldn't stop you. Also; the people that work there offer fabulous service and are willing to hold your hand while you wade through the menu (if they have the time...these girls are busy!)",14
11,"[REVIEW_1] One of our fave St.Pete restaurants. We prefer this location to the Cantina because of the complimentary valet parking. Every dish on the menu is pure perfection. Personal favorite is the Santa Fe chicken. Reservations are a must. It's that good ;) [REVIEW_2] If you come Tarpon Springs and don't have meal at Hellas that's gonna be a helluva good reason to come back to TS! We had a gang of 11 of us that came here for the day away from St Petersburg to chill out and feed our mugs! My fellow Yelpers thank you once again for leading us to the greenest pastures.... as I am now beginning to recite to myself "" as I walk through the valley of hunger I shall fear no starvation for YELP thou art with me Amen!  We had to wait about a 1/2 hour to be seated as this place was hopping. We got a table for 11 and were a bit cramped but no one was complaining.... we started of with the flaming Cheese and fried Smelts as the appetizer and they were amazing! We all ordered the different dishes and there were empty plates at the end.  I had the Gyro Sandwich and have yet to taste one as good! We all ambled out of there and ready for a snooze in anticipation of more partying tonight! We will definitely be back! [REVIEW_3] I finally got my water ice fix this weekend. Well actually; I kind of went twice; ssshh. The chocolate-cherry gelati was seriously orgasmic. Why did it take me until August to finally make it down there??! I will definitely be back a few more times while they are still open for the season. And if you haven't been; GO! I corrupted not one; but two Rita's fans this weekend. [REVIEW_4] I had the salted caramel donut and it was so delicious. Soft; fresh; and sweet. I also tried the pork belly slider and it was soooo delicious. I wish I had one right now. It had a wonderful combination of flavors and wonderful dressing.   I was also able to see how they prepare their dish and it was nice to see all of the fresh ingredients they used [REVIEW_5] Went to this store to get a passport sent to England A.S.A.P (which weighs next to nothing); they told me it would be $110 for 4 day delivery with no guarantee that it would arrive by then. I went to Fed Ex who told me they could do it for $57 with a 2 day guarantee. Shop around before using UPS!!! [REVIEW_6] Incredible service and food. I ordered the filet/shrimp combo with lobster Mac & cheese and brussel sprouts as sides. Everything was delicious! [REVIEW_7] extremely bad customer online support. only new vintages that is why they are cheap.  they are not interested in building long term clientele. their shiiping methods are terrible to say the least.  will never used them again  xam miami; florida [REVIEW_8] Customers beware! If there was a way to give this business zero stars- that is how I would rate it. There is a huge banner on this location that says it is under new management because of the horrible reputation that it has. To say that they ripped me off would be an understatement. I took my Ford diesel truck in because it was close by when my engine started smoking. Biggest mistake of my life. They kept my truck for over a month- sold me used parts and charged me as if they were new parts. Charged my bank card unauthorized charges and to top it off; after paying over $7;800.00 my truck still wasn't working. I finally took it to the Ford dealer where they documented everything that was wrong with my truck and even confirmed that the wrong type of USED turbo was put on my truck. The manager Ray at the time was also just on channel 13 news because he was arrested for doing this to other customers. Seems like Midas transferred him to another location after too many complaints. I will be contacting a lawyer and the District Attorneys office.   I should also mention that during this process Ray hired me to do Landscaping upgrades to the business and I never received payment. This is not a place that you can trust. [REVIEW_9] Yep; mind blown! Fresh ingredients; good price; large portions; and there's nothing flashy about it. I absolutely love this place and I will certainly spread the word and come back!! Nice job; SoCo; and keep up the good work!!! [REVIEW_10] Paid for the $25 wash and detail (the most deluxe package they offer); added leather cleaning for $20. My dog had been in the car while muddy so there was dried dirt on the backseat; which I mentioned. I knew when they called me after only 15 min that it wasn't cleaned well. When I saw it it was obviously that they hadn't cleaned the leather at all. When I said that to the guy he sprayed a towel and literally wiped down the back seat for less than a minute. Didn't clean any other leather on the headrests; doors; console-anywhere. The wipe down on the cup holders; steering column; etc was just as bad. The vacuuming was terrible; didn't get under the mats or the way back. They didn't clean the rims at all even the the package included rim detail and shine. I basically paid $45 for a drive through car wash. [REVIEW_11] Not very good. No salami. Boiled ham instead of baked. No salami. More like a Miami Cuban. This is Tampa. They're in the middle of a Hispanic area so you'd expect they'd do it right. Nope. Never again. [REVIEW_12] We have been to this location many times and always have a GREAT experience. Literally every time we are greeted by very friendly staff who will let you taste things before you order. We eat very healthy and appreciate the nice selection of healthy items. I am gluten free and have food intolerances and have always felt completely comfortable eating here. My food always comes out exactly as I ordered it even with all of the adjustments needed.   5 stars for both food and service!!! [REVIEW_13] Few things are more awe inspiring than water in the desert. It's like seeing life renewed. And it's what makes Sabino Canyon so special. There's lots of different things to do and trails to hike but the best is easily 7 Falls Trail. Which; as the name implies is a series of cascading waterfalls framed by high canyon walls. Found a really good and detailed description of the the hike here: http://www.fuistetravels.com/views/7fallstrail [REVIEW_14] I had the taco burger and it was amazing. I also highly recommend the veggie patty. Very fresh! [REVIEW_15] My boyfriend picked up a taco pizza from here and brought it home. I'd never had one before but the pictures looked okay. MOST disgusting thing I've ever had. He said they used to be much different and delicious and it has totally gone downhill. It was dry; crusty and hard cheese; no sauce; tasted like a piece of bread with lettuce and tomatoes on it. I swear I think they grabbed a 2-day old cheese pizza and threw some taco meat; lettuce and tomatoes on it and re-heated it in the microwave. I'll never be back; not for taco pizza; not for regular pizza. Yuck. [REVIEW_16] I've tried everything in the menu and I must say everything  is so good . Short rib tacos omg delicious  truly my fav!!! [REVIEW_17] I didn't even hesitate before giving this place 5 stars.  New Orleans is my husband and my favorite vacation city and we miss the food so much when we come home.  Someone suggested we try this place and it's quickly becoming a favorite!  Here's what we've tried so far: Jambalaya- awesome!  Great heat; rice consistancy was perfect (a peeve of mine).  Exactly how i like it!  Unfortunately; the hubby isn't into jambalaya; so we don't order it often.   Red beans and rice- traditional & delicious Brisket Gumbo- so tender; smokey; ridiculously good.   Muffaletta- this is one thing that you typically cannot find outside of NOLA.  Many places do their own variation; but the bread and the olive salad makes the dish.  I had heard that Serpes bakes rolls specifically for their muffs and I had to try it.  Spot on!  Love it; love it! Cafe au lait- mmmmm Beignets- this is the only thing I'd pass on.  Very good; but made with cinnamon with isn't my thing.  I always get take out and he packs everything for easy microwaving or reheating. [REVIEW_18] I've been here 3 times so far and each time I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. I've tried the peanut butter infused cold brew and iced americano I liked them both.  My mom had the cortado which she raved about. But the treats they home make here are my favorite part. Like the chocolate chia pudding topped with toasted coconut and raspberries is DELICIOUS :) Also the PB ball with chia seeds; coconut; oats; and chocolate chips goes perfectly with my coffee. This coffee shop is unique and has its own charm I love it! [REVIEW_19] This might be one of my favorite places of all time; not just in Philadelphia.  Luckily; our winter has had an identity crisis; bringing warmer days to the region.  This means more days to enjoy the trail.    The trail has many offshoots so if the paved trail is a bit too easy for you; you can up the difficulty.  On a recent trip; I took the beau across the river to the rockier terrain.  The roots; rocks; and fallen trees were not our friends and I am sure he is still angry at me.  Maybe I will leave that for solo trips.    On more leisurely trips; I have enjoyed to historical plaques to help point out noteworthy Philadelphia facts - like how we had the first water fountain (on the trail) and about the Lenape warrior statue.  Whatever your fitness level; the Wissahickon Trail is a good place to burn calories without feeling like you are burning calories. [REVIEW_20] I'm at the hotel now. Finally got up to my room after they refused to let me check in 20 min early (but I saw them letting others check in). Let's not forget to mention I paid $400+ for one night here. The room is absolutely disgusting. There are stains everywhere. There is a loud ringing noise that I can't figure out what it is or where it's coming from. I'm absolutely disgusting by this place.",13
12,"[REVIEW_1] Patrick Fitzgerald is an extremely helpful salesperson and makes it easy on you.  Thanks for taking the time to show me the MDX! [REVIEW_2] A friend of mine recommended this restaurant when i told him i would be in new Orleans. I went with a group of friends with high expectations. Since we were 7 we waited for more than an hour to get seated; which we took in good stride we just sat somewhere outside and chatted. When we were finally seated; it took the them about 15 minutes to come and take our orders and then...the ordeal started; the waiter told one of my friends to hurry up and order(he had just delivered the menus) or he will go and serve another table. There were about 4 of us on the table who had not ordered yet and we asked if he can take our orders first instead while my friend made up his mind but no...he said we had to follow the order we were seated. We let that slide; but then he delivered the drinks in a leaking glass and the food took another hour to come. People who arrived after we were seated had finished eating before we even had our food. Needless to say...the whole experience was so terrible there was nothing special about the food. [REVIEW_3] Do not go here ever again. I've been ordering here for seven years and tonight I ordered the usual for the family and it was horrible.  They couldn't even get the burger right. We ordered four combos; three with onion rings rings and one with fries. They put the one onion ring on the burger and they gave us all fries and screwed up the donair's. we called and complained about the order and they said we will remake it free of charge.  But they still screwed it up!  The doanir's came with lettuce and a dusting of donair meat. We asked for extra sweet sauce and we still had to look for any sauce at all!  The place is under new ownership and clearly they do not know what they are doing!  They couldn't even get the pop order correctly!  It was painful!! [REVIEW_4] Best iced latte and beignet we tried. The live music also creates a great atmosphere. We also visited Cafe du Monde but in our opinion Cafe Beignet is much better. The service is also very good and there are hardly ever lines. [REVIEW_5] Pathetic experience with them. I ordered for rava masala dosa and vegetable uttapam to take out. They gave me dosa which is as good as burnt. Packing was so bad that the dosa layer has stuck to the white sheet of wrap. It did not smell good either. I called them and explained the story. I was expecting an apology and someone to provide us with the replacement if not refund but nothing of the sort. They did not even apologize; forget about refund or replacement. i shall be disposing the dosa as is. Uttapam was not very good either. It tasted sour and cilantro seemed old. I could not take it more than few loaves. Remaining will go in the dustbin as well.  Such a disgusting experience with them [REVIEW_6] AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAUGE!!! I can see why they make money; this place is beautiful; but their customer service is atrocious. As someone in the event planning industry; I will see to it that I never recomend this location to any of my clients and will make sure all my partners and colleges know of the dissapointment that is Gaylord Opryland.  I was hesitant to even book this location due to the horrible reviews; but this is where she really wanted to go. Lesson learned the hard way. Never in my life have I been more disgusted with customer service; this establishment doesnt even deserve one star. As a professional event planner; I am very organized and always check my reservations. I have been planning my best friends bachelorette party since April; and booked online in advance. I called several times prior to our trip to assure it was okay that a seperate credit card holder reserved the room; and we paid with a deperate one.  I had guests arriving from all over; some drove 10+ hours and when they arrived; were not able to check in. They were refused to it being under a different name; even though I confirmed this was okay prior to arriving. They needed the confirmation number; but the one THEY SENT ME (email proof) was not working. I called the front desk while still en route to Nashville to let them know guests were waiting; and BOTH women were extremely rude and condescending. My guests had to wait an hour before getting a room.  We arrived at 4pm and had a tight schedule as we had activites starting at 5:30. We were supposed to go in; decorate for the celebration; get ready and leave. This was not the case. Upon checking in; I am told that they preauthorize the card AT CHECKIN; even though I confirmed several times over the phone that the card was just to reserve the room and we could pay at check out with our choice of payment. We had girls from all over the country coming that were bringing money towards the room; and it was to be deposited before checkout. We did not have time to go to the bank before our paid for; scheduled activities and the only offer they gave us was to preauthorize half of the amount one night until we get the rest tomorrow. At this point we are already late and not ready for our outing due to their poor communication; and it ruined our other experiences as well.  The fun doesnt stop there....we paid for a junior sweet with a sofa and a chair; two beds; and paid extra for a pull out bed. Upon FINALLY getting into our room; there is no extra bed; and not a sofa; but two chairs. This was crucial to our sleeping arrangments; and was all requeated and confirmed prior to arrival. We also requested it when they gave us a room key; and now its 12 oclock at night and we have one pull out sofa and they are still giving us a hard time about the sofa. If we could; wed pack and leave immediately but this is a once in a life time thing for my best friend; so were stuck here. Awful; awful; awful!  What a great scheme; draw in customers with a beautiful resort and then dont give a shit about them once they're here. Class act. [REVIEW_7] They guy behind the counter is not friendly or trustworthy; I had a feeling that they were trying to rip me off. I should haver read the reviews on yelp before going there. You would be better off going somewhere else. [REVIEW_8] Very unfriendly to people with dietary restrictions/allergies. Refused to make an accommodation.  Wouldn't come here again. [REVIEW_9] They had a wonderful doctor there that made dealing with their staff and scheduling issues worthwhile but she has since left and after a handful of appointments I am done with them.  There must be a better dermatology office in town.  They book out months; if not years in advance.  If you book the first appointment for the day they are still running at least 20 minutes late; the doctors and the staff show up almost a full half hour after they ""open"".  The staff tries to push cosmetic procedures on you and the one doctor I have seen is distracted and not paying attention.  During my yearly skin checkup last year I discussed my concern with bumps on my forehead that I could not get rid of and she told me I needed to use Retin-A type creams; but I had been using them and they clearly didn't work.  After researching on my own via internet I found I had a common fungal infection and washing my forehead with simple nizoral shampoo would clear it up; which it immediately did.  If you need a simple procedure done the doctor acts like it is no big deal to get you in but once you try to schedule it will be months before they see you.  Don't tell me to come in to get cystic acne treated with a cortisol shot if you are booking into next year.  After the misidentification/blow off of my forehead bumps I don't trust them for my basic yearly anymore.  I am so bummed the good doctor is gone; it is time to find another office. [REVIEW_10] My only hesitation to write this review is that it's almost trendy to review Tria; but the biz shouldn't be punished for it...   My mistake is I passed by this place so many times thinking I should stop in; especially since it's packed; but figured the alcohol would be overpriced and food would be an expensive art project; at best. I was wrong.   Rarely do you stop at a place like this. I've been twice and both visits were everything I'd want for a nice; casual dining experience. The first time I went we were the only ones outside (it looked like it was going to rain... and it did). The servers offered to reseat us immediately but we actually opted to sit outside and watch the rain. Everything was covered so it wasn't like our server got drenched coming to our table. I had a salmon sandwich; she had a salad and we shared a cheese plate. Everything was portioned and presented very well. The wine and beer they recommend went with the lunch nicely - we had a great time; so we came back a month later. This visit was equally enjoyable. We sat at the sleek bar for a drink before being shown to our table. I feel this spot is the perfect W. Washington Square casual experience coupled with it's nearby neighbor Varga for the rowdier experience. [REVIEW_11] Service was slow; forgot my order; took over ten minutes to get drink after ordering which I may add it took about 10 minutes to even get the server over here.....not worth the money at all [REVIEW_12] I used to come here a lot. However I will not be coming here very often in the future because the customer service seems to be lacking. My online order did not go through and this was very disappointing; they made me stand in line again and re-order my food and did not offer me any type of discount or compensation for this disservice. I asked to speak to the manager who also did not offer me any kind of compensation. They don't seem to care about customer satisfaction instead they were fine with the fact that my online order did not go through. So if you're reading this Panera please take into account that you should work to satisfy your customers. We order online because we have small kids [REVIEW_13] Excellent food and service.  Very romantic; vintage; sultry--and it feels like I've been swept away into a decade from a very long time ago.  Filet mignon and scallops are superb.  I've dined here 3 times and have had an excellent experience each time! [REVIEW_14] The ambience and food are great. I enjoyed the old village Lebanese style architecture. The food was on the expensive side but definitely well worth it for the quality. I highly recommend the home made drinks especially the homemade jallab. I'm looking forward for the restaurant to open [REVIEW_15] Where I think the meat and fish selection looks fine and they carry some exotic meats in the freezer I just cannot recommend this place. I had purchased a Groupon and was pretty excited about trying this place out. When I got there I decided to walk around the entire store to see what kind of goodies I wanted to buy. Once I got around to the back of the store buy the beer; wine and dried goods I started to smell the stench of cigarettes. At first I was willing to write this off as maybe a door was open by the loading dock. But then I walked by the office with the door wide open and two people smoking openly. I choose to ask them why they were smoking in the building and all they could do was write it off as ""smoking in the office"" and ""yeah it's a dirty habit"". Not addressing that it's ILLEGAL in the state of Florida to smoke inside a business like this; you know the whole Indoor Clean Air Act. Besides I don't want to buy what is supposed to be fresh meat and the like in a place that cigarette smoke lingers in the air. The only reason I bought anything was to use my Groupon but on second thought I should have just walked out empty handed.   I don't think they understand the purpose of Groupon. It is designed to get new customers in the door with the goal of becoming regular customers. In this case they scared me away from ever shopping there again. What a shame they could have something pretty nice on their hands otherwise. [REVIEW_16] The manager of this McDonalds needs to teach the help the Big Mac jingle....It starts with Two all beef patties.....TWO....TWO...not one freakin patty you idiots! How can you forget to make a big mac and forget one of the burgers? It's not rocket science! Also the slowest and dimmest counter help to take orders. They take one order at a time and then b.s. with the help next to them while the lines get longer.   So the advice is to make sure you ask for EVERYTHING you want them to put on a bun for you or it will be missing. [REVIEW_17] Rude staff that stands around and does nothing besides stand in a circle and talk to each other. Doesn't bother to greet you when you walk in the door. Facility is old and not well cared for. [REVIEW_18] I am a long-time client of Four Paws. Amanda is continuing the high quality of service that I received from the prior owners.  I have total confidence that my cat will be well cared for when I have to travel. [REVIEW_19] Haven't been to a Philllip's in a long; long time. So when work took me to the Sheraton in Philly I thought it was time to reacquaint myself with my childhood seafood place... Bad idea.  The crab cakes I remembered as delicious morsels of ambrosia turned out to be overly greasy; too little crab; and much too little taste. At least they were edible. The grilled snapper (fish of the day) and asparagus that I got on the side were overcooked and drowned in butter as if this could hide the unmistakable blandness of the food.  I was quite literally crushed. Hoping this is was symptomatic of the location and not the chain. Will have to try the one in Baltimore and pray that it lives up to my childhood memories. [REVIEW_20] Really truly slow service.  Not the waitress. The kitchen. 40 min to get a pasta and salad.  Recommended if you want to really drag that date out.",6
13,"[REVIEW_1] Service and food was absolutely HORRIBLE. Waited in the drive thru for a half hour before I could even roll up to have my order taken because the staff was serving out food so slow. Then once I finally got to where you place your order; I had to wait for 5 more minutes before anyone took my order. Then I had to repeat myself 3 times before they could hear my order and they didn't apologize for the wait or at least explain the situation. Then once I finally got the the window nobody even apologized for making us all wait for horribly long time. Once I finally got my food and it was cold as could be; the meat on my burger was dry; and had NO toppings on it and the buns were dry and hard. Worst service I have EVER HAD. Staff was rude and food was horrible; cold and dry [REVIEW_2] Went with appointment for oil change. Arrived early. Oh you are next. Left for 40 minutes. Came back car still sitting in same spot. All bays. EMPTY!!!!!  Sorry they haven't gotten to you yet. WTF. I'm out. Never again [REVIEW_3] Food was OK... Not WOW or horrible Service though... Hmm... We were there during happy hour and it was our first time to the restaurant; so we thought we would try all the small burgers on the happy hour specials. We ordered ""one if each"" and even name each of them individually and they served us 5 of the same... We told them about it; they took it away and served us what we ordered 20mins later. The server who took our order didn't even come and apologize nor come to check in with us when we were eating.  And... At the end... We paid cash thinking we can kill him with kindness... But he come back without the correct change; keeping all the coins... [REVIEW_4] this place was awful. the first time my mother and I went we were very excited because everyone had been talking about it and we want to support local business. The day we went it happened to be pouring raining. So we are standing there at the hostess stand cold and wet waiting to be seated. Not only was the hostess not there; no one even acknowledged that we were there. The bartender who was right next to he stand was on his blue tooth and only looked our way to flirt with me. My mom was so annoyed we just left.   The second time we went was because we were going to be in the area and we decided to give it a second try. We were seated right away and the music was really good. The waiter could have cared less about our table. he acted like we were doing him a favor by even coming to the table. The menu was thin and nothing to really choose from. when he eventually brought the food it was decent. My mom hated her salmon cakes because they were overly breaded and poorly season. it honestly looked like two pieces of bread.   It was overpriced for what we had. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. The take out makes great dog food though. [REVIEW_5] Will never go to this dealership again.  Got a written price quote via email for a Honda Odyssey. Went to the dealership; but they did not have the color and model I wanted (in which case why quote a price; but lets just ignore that as agressive marketing.) We agreed that they would add a DVD player to a lesser model; and also agreed on the price - this time with a printed quote in my hand. Went back after a week to close the deal and pick up the van; but they wanted a higher price; in effect renegging on the deal.  I walked out.  Went to a different dealership - Burns Honda - where I got the model I wanted and at the promised price. [REVIEW_6] I went in here the other day for a rehearsal dinner and it was the worst service. 2 waiters had our table but we still had empty cups the whole time had to ask for breadsticks about 4 times; nothing we had was got it was all room temp; and he messed the bill up in the end. [REVIEW_7] Well; honestly if I could give zero star than I would; because it is extremely Americanized not close to being Indian. The items on the menu are a complete creation of the owner.  For example; There is nothing like salad chat or a tandoori tikka chat in india. So if you are looking to eat real Indian chat; than I would not go there. I don't know how the place got all the positive reviews; maybe some free food for reviews; who knows. But this review is coming from an Indian who loves Indian food and has explored many Indian restaurant serving Chat across the country. I know it's a bit harsh; but the goal is to give  honest review of the food; without being rude. I hope it helps!! [REVIEW_8] 11/4 Usually you go to an automatic and prepare your self to be told you need more than what's wrong. Not here. Sean  gave me his honest opinion and quoted me on exactly what I needed gave me best and worst case financial scenarios and booked my appointment. I really appreciate his honesty.   Being a woman driving an expensive car people try to get over on you. Not here I would recommend this place hands down   11/06 I was waiting on a call back today to get my car fixed because on Saturday one of the guys hurt his hand and my piece still needed to be ordered so we had to schedule an appointment . I never received the call so I figured I'd call because I understand people get busy and forget things; I get it. However when I called and explained a little bit about the situation Nick said sure come in; with not fully understanding what was going on before I agreed to take a 30 min drive I asked him did the piece come in? His reply was no. I immediately asked  why am I coming in then? He said he'll look around for the part and call me back. Long story short. I go in because he said the part has arrived. I get their I tell him of my time restrictions he said it was a 3 1/2 hour job and  assured me it will be fixed today at 4:30pm Because I was dropping the car off at 12pm. I receive a call at 3:57 pm with nick telling me that the car not only isn't ready but the original stated problem isn't even the problem and that the car won't be ready until tomorrow. So that means you were gonna work on the car for 30 min if you just realized at 3:57 that it wasn't the control arm but the shocks; after you told me it was a 3 hour job?? Then told me that my car wouldn't be able to be put together tonight then said it could; he did however order my Uber to get their after ordering it to the wrong address the first time   I was so exited about finding a trustworthy mechanic until this happened   Sean the owner is a great person I'm sure they all are however I no longer trust their judgment. [REVIEW_9] Just moved to Nashville and was dreading finding a new vet that I loved and had reasonable prices.. With that said; we LOVE Dr. K! She is so personable and was really great with my dog; he was so comfortable the whole time. She also is very honest about pricing and tries the least expensive treatment first and discusses all the options with you! Would 100% recommend Parker's Paws! [REVIEW_10] Bait and switch! Buyer beware - falsely advertised price!  Went with a friend to check out a used Honda odyssey with an Internet advertised price ($24;999). Friend called the day before to confirm that the car was there and the price before we drove over an hour to get there. We checked out the car it was very nice and we were ready to buy when he dropped the real price on us of $34;600 - a HUGE difference! We could get a new car for that price!  The salesman said sorry that must be a typo but was unapologetic or willing to negotiate. Of course he was willing to show us something else. Stay away from these low sales tactics and spend your money somewhere else! [REVIEW_11] i wish i could have given it a zero or a negative.  my first and last experience was not pleasant at all. i ordered the tabbouleh and hummus platter when it came imagine my surprise to find the tabbouleh was about 96% parsley.  i kept looking for the bulgur wheat and there was literally none to speak of.  when i brought this to the attention of the staff i was blown off and treated as if i did not know what i was talking about.  i then asked for a to go and forgot it when i left.  i came back in under three minutes and it had been tossed already.  the next time i want mediterranean food i will support a local mediterranean restaurant that is owned and operated by mediterraneans.  this is poorly prepared fast food in a semi pretty package. [REVIEW_12] Even though I don't buy a huge amount of wood;   Curt treats me like I'm a five star GC.  Highly recommended.  Love the service. [REVIEW_13] No military discount for my son headed to Kuwait to serve our county! Shame on you all! All other places were happy to give the standard discount. Unacceptable! [REVIEW_14] Amazing tacos. Don't judge a book by its cover. It may look like its run down and no good but the food is awesome. Street tacos are bomb.com [REVIEW_15] Went back with my mom because I couldn't think of better competition at the time. She's much more keen to detail; specifically cleanliness. We took our food to go as she was jaw dropped at how unkept this place is. Also worth mentioning is that over my MANY drop ins for a quick coffee; the coffee counter has never once been fully stocked. Too many one star visits. Was great in comparison to the one up Easton road that closed. Now is just gross. [REVIEW_16] Slum Lords of the worth kind.  Don't expect your security deposit back. If you so much as put a hole in the wall to hang a picture they will charge you for damaging the property. They will lie and say you broke things; and the place was trashed in order to keep your security deposit. They will basically try to get as much money out of you as they can. If you try to pay online that will cost a fee; but they won't tell you; just so they can get more money.  They also do not upkeep their properties well. Our roof leaked and the air conditioning didn't work. They would not replace it or pay someone properly to fix the roof. They are slum lords of the worth. They will take your money and claim you ruined their place without proper evidence. Do not trust them. I don't care how bad you need a place; they will mistreat you and steal your security deposit. You have been warned! [REVIEW_17] Tried this place out this morning due to the relatively cheap price and good reviews and I was VERY disappointed. I swear my spicy tuna roll was warm and nobody wants room temperature raw fish! The mussels were dried out and tiny and 90% of the rolls on the menu have cream cheese so there's not much variety. I had two rolls and just left rather than continue eating there and will not be returning when there are so many other good sushi options in Reno.  I will saw however that the staff was very friendly; and I don't think it was the staffs fault as much as it as the obviously low quality ingredients. [REVIEW_18] So disappointed with this place. Read great reviews and had high hopes. We ordered Singapore noodles; honey garlic chicken; chicken balls & Chicken fried rice. Very bland taste; most of it went to the bin. For all you Irish people that are expecting it to be as good as home; it most certainly is nothing like it. [REVIEW_19] If I could give half a star I would; I'm from Tx; and anyone that thinks this is BBQ; I am willing to apologize to you for being led to believe that this is what BBQ is like. I ordered the sample platter; horrific; the chicken looked and tasted like frozen pressed meat; the ribs.... All cartilage; the sausage; bland.... The sauce.... Walmart basic sauce with cups of sugar thrown in.... Extremely overpriced for ummm.... A child's plate (what it seemed like). I would never recommend this place to anyone. [REVIEW_20] This was my second time going  First time service was very slow; Because it's new ;I let that pass 2nd time 11/30/14  There was hair in our food and not one but 4 plates Inexcusable !!! I will not return",3
14,[REVIEW_1] OMG!!! I can't believe this kind of service exists!  My husband called to make an appointment for full detailing for next Sat with Michael; he called again to confirm on Fri before we head there since it's a distance from our home.  Michael said he didn't know we wanted to do full detailing thou we specifically mentioned that.  He advised us to come the following sat instead.  We agreed and we reached there at 8am on the following week.  Guess what?  Nobody is at the workshop; it's closed!  We called him and he said he is busy and will call back.. We waited for half an hour in our car and there is still no call from him.  We headed for our breakfast and came back again at 9:30am hoping to give him another chance.  Here comes Alex; his partner opening the shop at 9:30am!  1.5 hours away from our appt time and still no sight of Michael.  Alex tried calling Michael and couldn't get hold of him.  We gave up!!! What a horrendous experience! [REVIEW_2] This restaurant is seriously lacking in customer service!  We have dined many times at Dish.  We like the food.  We made a reservation two weeks ahead for 3 people.  When we arrived we were seated at the smallest table in the restaurant which barely fits two people.  The table next to us had an extra person added at the end; his back was literally a couple of inches from our table.  We asked for a table that would accomdate three people and not involve eating with someone's large back at our very tiny table.  We were rudely informed that it was a take or leave it situation.  It was very frustrating since we booked this as a special night out weeks earlier.  Unfortunately; we are writing this restraurant off our list. [REVIEW_3] This place was awful. I really like Mexican food; but this place is so not Mexican food. My hubby and I went for dinner on a Tues. It was busy for a Tues. so we were excited. We were seated quickly and our server gave us our drinks quickly; but it was a downturn after that. First the chips and salsa were tasteless; I have found better tasting salsa from jar salsa at the grocery store. Also we waited for ridiculous 45 minutes for our food to come out. All we ordered was tacos; a burrito; and one chicken enchilada. Simple freaking meals...I mean come on that should take 10 minutes. After the server gave us our food finally...he never came back to check if we needed anything else. We could not even flag anyone to refill our waters. The burrito and tacos were very bland but edible. The chicken enchilada was the worst enchilada I have ever had. I couldn't even eat it. The red sauce on it tasted like some old can enchilada sauce that has been sitting in their kitchen for awhile. After we were done eating we sat there for another 15 minutes before the server came to our table. I told him I didn't like the enchilada and he did take it off the check; but that doesn't make up for one of the worst service from a restaurant that I have experienced. We won't be back. Good luck Poblanos. [REVIEW_4] I tired to be calm and not get upset . But I had a recurring charge going to my credit card and I was told it would be self payment . Because I asked about auto pay because the location was in Laplace and I was not sure if I would come back . So when I check my credit card statement there was of course a auto payment for 3 months and just this month of May their were two in one month so I was upset that I did not know because I had not been going and had join a different gym .  So to avoid me getting upset about losing money and the double charge I had on my May statement. I felt I would just call and cancel the subscriptions! Ow was I in for it . They make you send an email to them !!! And then you have to wait for a response ! I signed up at the location with ease why is cancellation not as easy ! Omg then told me I have to give 30days notice so I would basically still have to pay for June and then pow ! A cancellation fee !! Or you serious !! So all together to unjoin a whopping $57 dollars only from me visiting once !  I was so upset because I have already lost so much money and don't like the place . so I call my credit card and charge it as Fraud !! And had to be sent a card replacement because I'm not having it ! It was a lesson learned and you just would not think a gym business would take advantage of you like that . Because even when my card changed at planet fitness they did not charge back pay ; only charged for that month . Smh plz save yourself the headache! [REVIEW_5] Ridiculous prices for small portions/little meat/mostly rice. [REVIEW_6] I really wanted to like this place. I do not.   There were a lot of problems with the service. We were told that there was a thirty minute wait. The problem; however; was not that they were too busy; it's that it takes 15 minutes for anyone to bus a table. I saw 3 employees walk by a table that needed bussing without grabbing anything.   After we were seated; our waitress forgot just about everything we asked for. It took twenty minutes to get the check. Other tables had similar problems. A couple sitting at the bar were told the kitchen lost their order. That's it--no apology; nothing. Oddly enough; the manager and our waitress kept high-fiving and referring to each other as rock stars.   The long wait built up our anticipation of the food. Unfortunately; the food was a let down. Everything was under-seasoned and bland.   All in all; lunch took an hour and a half; and cost $45.00 for two. I normally don't write negative reviews; but I can't help feeling like I got ripped off. [REVIEW_7] Terrible service. Called in an order for pick up and completely butchered my order. I asked for a half sausage half cheese pizza and felt like he had no clue what i was saying as i had to constantly repeat myself. i had my boyfriend call back to make sure the order was right and he repeated back the order that i ordered half sausage half BEEF??? So after we corrected him and picked up or pizza; we got back and opened it up and it was ALL SAUSAGE. This is the second time in the past month i have had terrible service. The first time i got there for pickup and they had completely forgotten to put my order in. Terrible. [REVIEW_8] I have a very dear spot reviewing this park. Even if I have been here only once; it left quite the impression!  It's a well known park but it seemed like one of Greenwood's secret gems. When we arrived; there were parents actually playing with and watching their kids. (Safety! Who woulda thought?! *sarcasm*)  Anyway; parking is close but far back enough kids are safe from the parking lot. When you first arrive you'll see a shared library hut. (Take a book leave a book guidelines) SO COOL! I've only heard about them; so I was overly excited to see this. They had a bathroom too; in an actual building!  There's five main sections: splash park; music area; age group 2-5; age group 5-12; and swings.  I even had fun playing with my stepdaughter! My boyfriend joked that they should make an adult sized section; but that's actually not a bad idea.  I'm not use to such a nice community yet but I'm glad I can feel comfortable taking her somewhere so clean and wonderful in Greenwood. This is your typical Yelp line; but I really will be coming back here and not any other park! The extra 5 minutes towards the drive is worth it. [REVIEW_9] Very disappointing food.  Too bad I cannot give a minus 1 star. The food was just below average and overpriced. I know Good Peruvian food; I also know a bad imitation trying to pass for decent food. The bad service was also another disappointment. Overall this place gives Peruvian Cuisine a bad name. I will never return or recommend this place. [REVIEW_10] We would have loved to try this restaurant but unfortunately we were told they had stopped serving food when we got there (we got there shortly before 10pm). The Eldorado website clearly stated that they served lunch and dinner until close. I was very unimpressed. We did not even have a chance to try their beer as we had been driving for 5 hours and needed food first. [REVIEW_11] My husband ordered 2 boxes of pizza and garlic bread twist w/ extra garlic sauce on the side at 10:30pm. By 11:30pm we were still waiting on the food to arrive. My husband decided to call to get an ETA and he was told 25 mins....by the general manager. It is 12am and we just received the food! Upon arrival the food was dry; no longer hot and did not have the extra sauce we paid for! If you are looking for good food this is NOT the place! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! [REVIEW_12] Short and sweet - Been here three times and haven't been impressed. This last time I called in an order. The guy taking my order was rude and not helpful. I don't know the menu and asked him some questions and he knew about as much as I did. When arriving to pick up. Had to look for service. Was surprised by the 27$ bill for one entree. Got home; missing salad; over cooked steak; over cooked fries. Never again. Hope not everyone has that experience! Good luck.   P.S bring your cash cow. This place is PRICY especially for the quality of food [REVIEW_13] Finally the brick and mortar version of Spot has arrived!  Inventive burgers; the freshest ingredients and a lively; family friendly atmosphere. Get there during the off peak times if you want to be ensured a seat. This place fills up fast!  Looking forward to eating my way through the burgers; then the other hot specialty sandwiches.    Still sniffing the fat and juices on my fingers long after the burger is gone. Sad to have to wash my hands. [REVIEW_14] I just received my Doberge cake in the mail; and must say it is the highlight of this birthday month! I grew up in New Orleans; but now live in California. There is no better cake on the planet! It was a bit of a splurge to have one shipped to me; but so worth it. Wow! The memories it brought back!!! It arrived in perfect condition and right on time. They've improved the shipping on these cakes. I ordered one a few years ago; and the frosting peeled off when I peeled off the plastic wrapping. Not any more! It was just perfect this time!  My other favorite splurge is getting the amazing king cakes at Mardi Gras time. They're the best! I bring them to work and everyone flips out over them. My daughters in college expect them now too. They get the king cakes; beads; etc; and have gotten lots of attention in the dorms because of them! One daughter said that people will say they will just have a little sliver; then they always come back for more. The baby in the king cake is always a fun topic for Californians to learn about.   Thanks for helping me to relive my childhood memories!!! [REVIEW_15] Had a great time here. Moderate wait at the bar - but we did get there pretty late. Our first table was freezing and the waitress was beyond rude. We asked to move and the manager could not have been more accommodating and understanding. The replacement waiter; Quentin was the real deal - he was knowledgeable; attentive and kind. We all had the red fish for our main course which was amazing!!! Bread pudding and profiteroles for desert did not disappoint. Great time with great company in a lovely restaurant - overall a perfect first day in NOLA. [REVIEW_16] Poor service from the door. Stood at the door for 15 mins; walked in when it was not super busy it was Thursday at 12pm. I'm pregnant and there is no more seating area; which I think was a stupid decision when they reopen so they can flip more tables. Was ignored by 2 staff members who seating 3 people before me. Food was cold the times I come in there. The French toast is horrible. They just good making basic eggs that doesn't take much flavor or time. I get the actual egg not the ready made batter. Over fried meats. Burnt has Browns. Save your money & go to a mom & pop local diner to get more for your money. [REVIEW_17] Ask for Dominick!  You'll get dinner AND a show.  We had the best meal and he is hilarious.  The food is delicious as usual and the show was fantastic.  What a fantastic birthday evening with the family. [REVIEW_18] Cute Japanese restaurant in Old City. Fresh sushi and amazing ramen. Wonderful customer service! This is my new favorite go to for sushi and ramen. There is a great selection on the menu. [REVIEW_19] Tires etc. Has quick; reliable and affordable service. The best staff (polite and honest) i never feel taken advantage of.  I am on a tight budget and i was trying to purchase the least expensive tires for my car. There was only one of the tires I wanted in stock; so they upgraded the tires at the discounted rate. We got new brakes at Midas; they squeaked; squealed and sometimes grind something awful (it was embarrassing). Midas told me it was an issue with the make of our car (although they never squeaked or grind before unless we needed repair).  Tires etc replaced those Midas brakes and viola! squeaking and grinding gone  and I even paid less. Needed front headlight on 2009 Malibu (a tricky job) pep boys had our car for 2 hours then told us they couldnt do it; go to dealership. Midas told us they could but charged over a hundred dollars. Dealership was booked for appts till next week. Tires etc did it in an hour for about $50 less than Midas. Enough said this is the only place we take our car. Oh yeah one more thing;  the waiting area is the BEST! oversized leather arm chairs. Always clean; comfortable; hot and cold refreshments; cable TV and wifi! [REVIEW_20] Good service but TERRIBLE FOOD. Overcooked everything; one of the worst dining experiences ever.,7
15,"[REVIEW_1] Cannot vouch for the doctor; as the receptionist was so breathtakingly rude that I didn't even schedule an appointment. They might want to rethink their desk staff if they want to appear welcoming and friendly. [REVIEW_2] I absolutely love the wings here! The sauces are delicious and I recommend the honey mustard and their buffalo fries both are winners. I've never once been disappointed from the food here! [REVIEW_3] I took my BMW 528 in for some body work on the trunk and rear quarter panel. Although the estimate was a little higher than others; I was very impressed with the knowledge and professionalism of Jennifer and decided to go with Goldies. The repairs and paint job were outstanding and my car was ready when promised. I'd give the body work an A.  I also paid for an interior and exterior detailing for $250. The air vents and dash area look brand new which is amazing since my car is a 1997. The rubber around the sunroof was missed and I learned the window hadn't been opened so there was no opportunity to see what needed to be cleaned there. Chips in the paint were touched up. Jennifer said the wax should last for 30 days which I didn't think was great. I'd give the detailing job a B. [REVIEW_4] They had a wonderful doctor there that made dealing with their staff and scheduling issues worthwhile but she has since left and after a handful of appointments I am done with them.  There must be a better dermatology office in town.  They book out months; if not years in advance.  If you book the first appointment for the day they are still running at least 20 minutes late; the doctors and the staff show up almost a full half hour after they ""open"".  The staff tries to push cosmetic procedures on you and the one doctor I have seen is distracted and not paying attention.  During my yearly skin checkup last year I discussed my concern with bumps on my forehead that I could not get rid of and she told me I needed to use Retin-A type creams; but I had been using them and they clearly didn't work.  After researching on my own via internet I found I had a common fungal infection and washing my forehead with simple nizoral shampoo would clear it up; which it immediately did.  If you need a simple procedure done the doctor acts like it is no big deal to get you in but once you try to schedule it will be months before they see you.  Don't tell me to come in to get cystic acne treated with a cortisol shot if you are booking into next year.  After the misidentification/blow off of my forehead bumps I don't trust them for my basic yearly anymore.  I am so bummed the good doctor is gone; it is time to find another office. [REVIEW_5] I love Ybor eats! The food is delish! Great service; super friendly; and great prices! My favorite quick morning meal is the sausage; egg; and cheese breakfast sandwich on a Kaiser roll! [REVIEW_6] I travel to and through St Louis a few times a year; and Ted Drewes is a must-stop. Always a big crowd; but the friendly staff know how to move the people and keep the custard coming; so don't let a large crowd keep you from stopping by. I try a different specialty of theirs every time I go; and I'm never disappointed. Just the best custard ever! Very high quality ingredients and if I lived in St Louis; they would get a large portion of my income; as I wouldn't be able to help myself from going constantly. And did I mention how reasonably priced they are! I love this place. [REVIEW_7] Short waits; strong drinks; great food. Service sets them apart. My bloody was damn good and damn strong. Eat here. [REVIEW_8] After so many wawa soups you almost forgot how nice it is to get a real meal. The chicken escarole soup was excellent. Great cheesesteak also. The bar has good seating and a nice selection of craft beers. Prices are good also. They have a friendly staff as well. [REVIEW_9] Awesome thin crust. Nice spot You won't find a better pizza in Philly  Great food; salad bar; fresh fruit  Gourmet slices  Fantastic food and large dining area with TV.  This is legit 5-star [REVIEW_10] Franklin Nails gave me the best mani/pedi I've had in a long time.  Now a days I feel rushed at nail salons; and if I want a relaxing experience I've had to pay for it. Not here. With a gel manicure and pedicure; I was there for over an hour and a half. They really took their time. One week later; and both mani and pedi are going strong. So reasonably priced too! I'll be back! [REVIEW_11] Don't go here. They gave me grief over the groupon then didn't bother to actually change my oil filter or tell me that they hadn't changed it so I drove 5k miles on an old filter. Crappy customer service; rude attitude; find somewhere better. [REVIEW_12] Excellent service!! Great happy hour deal!! I only tried the chips and guacamole this time; but I will be back to try more. Fresh and delicious food. [REVIEW_13] LOVE Delicia! The meal starts with a small shot of soup that is meant to open up your palate? All I know is it tastes like gravy; and it's delicious. I recently had the Enchiladas de Pato (duck) and it was so delicious! I would definitely get it again. We also got the empanadas as an app once and those were also very good. I have loved everything I've ever gotten here. And last year they had half price bottles of wine on Mondays; I believe. If they are still doing that; I'll have to make more weekday visits! [REVIEW_14] A coworker took me to lunch here; this was my first time visiting a Firehouse Subs restaurant. The restaurant was clean; and the servers were very friendly and attentive. My sandwich (meatball) was served promptly and was very fresh and hot. The wheat bread was awesome. They have one of the new pop machines that lets you pick from several dozen flavors. The variety of subs leans to the healthy side. They have only white and wheat bread. There is a slight bit of uniqueness to their subs; but mostly they are pretty standard (more like Subway than like Which Wich). I think the price for a medium sub and drink is a bit high: $9. A great place to eat for a change up on sandwiches. [REVIEW_15] I read at least 30 reviews before I decided to eat here. The only thing that was good was the oysters because it's raw. Everything else was dry and tasteless. The space is cramp. We had people on our backs coughing on us while sitting at the bar trying to enjoy it. Let's just say the 2 half and half baskets that my boyfriend and I ordered was not worth $60. [REVIEW_16] Went because a friend ask me to meet her there. It lived up to all the bad reviews given. It was 7pm 3 people at the bar; bartender playing on her phone & talking to her friend at the end of the bar. No hello; can I get you something? After standing at the bar for a while she finally came over. I ordered a beer which she handed me unopened. I paid and walk to the table my friend and 3 others were sitting. At about 8pm 15 very young people walked in and had an even longer wait for her to even acknowledge there presence. I was guessing for Karaoke which doesn't start till 9pm. I left at 8:30pm. I have no idea how they stay in business and certainly don't know how she makes any money. Clearly the owner is not interested in making this a place to go. I went to the Old Double D many many years ago and I bet the original owner is glad he's gone-he should have never let them keep the name. [REVIEW_17] Our new favorite breakfast place! So glad we decided to try Brunchies. Went there for breakfast on Labor Day and we were impressed with the variety and selections on the menu. We were seated within 10 minutes when the place looked very busy. It looks like they work hard at getting you seated as soon as possible. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was nice. I ordered the Belgian waffle with strawberries and my husband ordered the Brunchies club which was so large; he brought half of it home. I love how they leave a carafe of coffee at the table. Our food was tasty and we will definitely go back soon. It's great have another 4 or 5-star restaurant in the area. [REVIEW_18] They are dirty; have very bad service; they are very distracted. They stop during your mani + pedi to help someone else for 15 min at a time. Took almost 2 hrs for me and a friend to get a mani pedi; and not because they were being attentive. Would not recommend; will not go back. Tina's Nails is awesome. [REVIEW_19] This is a great place to spend the afternoon walking around and going through all the stores; I really like the shuttle services they have; as well as the firepits. [REVIEW_20] Good food. Beautifully decorated. The owner was extremely nice and came out to ask how our food was. The vodka and cranberry I ordered was very small and tasted watered down. I swapped it for a beer and was much happier. We will definitely be returning.",14
16,"[REVIEW_1] This review is LONG overdue!  I visited Stitch-It in June 2013  In brief: Stitch it did an EXCELLENT job on my dress and I was extremely pleased.  I needed it done in a rush and they were able to accommodate me.  Given the tight turnaround; and the work that needed to be done; I didn't mind paying a premium.  The service and results far exceeded my expectations.  Complete Experience: I was attending a convention in Nashville; TN and had ordered an evening gown online a week before (admitted procrastinator tendencies).  The gown was a navy blue Tadashi Shoji evening gown with sequins and an intricately designed lace and sheer layered bodice. The gown was a tad bit too long and there was a bulge in the back. The dress arrived a few days before I was scheduled to fly out to Nashville and I knew I wouldn't have time to get it tailored before leaving.  I found a few Nashville area tailor shops on Yelp; read the reviews and decided I might try Stitch-It.  I also saw a few cleaners that advertised they performed tailoring services; but they (quite frankly) didn't give me the warm and fuzzies.    Stitch-It was about a 30 minute drive from the Gaylord Hotel where I was staying; so before taking a taxi that far; I decided to check with the hotel to see if they had an in-house tailor.  When I took the dress to the Gaylord tailor/seamstress (who was the nicest lady ever); she looked at the gown and said ""I can hem the bottom....I'd have to do it by hand.  The top part though....I won't touch that with a 10ft. pole!""  I laughed; but appreciated her honesty in not being able to handle the work that I needed done.    I contacted Stitch-It and sent pictures of the dress via text message to a nice young man who's name I can't remember (I think it was Cameron...I could be wrong).  They assured me that they should be able to accommodate me; so I hopped a cab and visited Stitch-It.  When I arrived I was greeted by courteous and professional staff.  I was shown to the dressing room and changed into my gown.  My personal tailor was Maggie O'Neill and she was AWESOME!  After the fitting and pinning; I left the gown and picked it up in two days.  It fit perfectly and was well worth the fee.  If I lived in Nashville; I would DEFINITELY use Stitch-It on a regular basis. [REVIEW_2] *This review is just about the Fountain Grill*  Wow; this was one of the best meals i've eating in a long long time. I never say that.   Dinner was so good; that I even ordered a Woodford Reserve to make it an occasion. The GF got a glass of red and form the start the service was really good.   House Salad - check! Hot Bread & Butter - check! Prime Rib Special - check! Chicken Cordon Blue - check!  Both dinners were cooked perfect and the taste was amazing. A total surprise for us both.  We are going to plan another dinner there and get some desert! [REVIEW_3] I was in Boise visiting family and one of my sisters raved about Express Cafe. Even though it was lunch time; I ordered breakfast and it did not disappoint. The pancakes are huge; eggs perfectly cooked; yummy bacon; etc. service was impeccable!! Will definitely return on my next visit. [REVIEW_4] Wings Wings and more Wings!  Chatham Tap is my favorite place to get wings in the Indianapolis area.  They are meaty; the sauce is great; and I usually always have to take some home for the next day.  I went with a fairly large group and got to sample different things on the menu.  I highly recommend the onion rings!  They have a large selection of beer as well.  Since I heard they were a ""soccer bar"" I did not know what to expect when I first arrived.  However; the atmosphere is great.  It is full of fans of all different sports and the staff is willing to show whatever sport you want to watch on TV.  The service was excellent.  No one in my group had to ask for one thing while we were there.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who is up for a great meal; great service and a great time with friends. [REVIEW_5] The ambiance is pleasant; welcoming; and clean. Sabrina's is a stylized balanced blend of modern and eclectic decor. The service is timely and inviting. Hands down a must stop for delicious food on any road trip or just a hungry night out. Definitely meets up to the 5 Star rating! [REVIEW_6] Caveat: I am so hesitant to give away my secrets- well not really. I've got to say; I love capitalism; and because of that I think you too should have the power of knowledge.  John Jay is a little more expensive than what I am accustomed to. However; Neomi; is totally worth it. I have received excellent hair cuts from her. I only see her a few times a year but when I leave I feel great. Sometimes I bring in pictures of people's hair that I have ripped out of magazines and she teaches me how to recreate the hairstyle. Now; that is love. When I had to get my eyebrows waxed; a terribly unfortunate experience; the woman doing them was well trained. She also made sure that it didn't hurt. How that was possible? I am not really sure. Because I am an absolute whimp. John Jay is worth every penny. [REVIEW_7] I get the King Soup every time I go. It never disappoints. Great service. Friendly workers. Humble  Owner. Authentic food. AND BYOB. Can't beat that. The new fruit tarts they serve are a hit also. [REVIEW_8] An amazing and innovative new establishment; we stopped in on a weekend trip from Vegas. Good was excellent (bone marrow was stellar) and the brews were top notch. The corn whiskey was excellent and the service was friendly with a touch of class. We enjoyed it so much that we returned the next night to enjoy more of its diverse menu and beer selection...  Most definitely worth a ""shot"" and Reno is lucky to have this great option for food; beer and whiskey connoisseurs... [REVIEW_9] Cute Japanese restaurant in Old City. Fresh sushi and amazing ramen. Wonderful customer service! This is my new favorite go to for sushi and ramen. There is a great selection on the menu. [REVIEW_10] I have NEVER been disappointed by them! I have tried practically the entire menu and it has all been tasty. Great portion for the price and relatively quick service considering everything is cool to order. Nice hidden jewel on the Northwest side of Naptown. [REVIEW_11] After the swamp tour we became sooo hungry!!! So stumbled upon The Mona Lisa lounge ....this here is customerservice at its best. This is what you call Southern hospitality! THE FOOD!!! Fresh and flavorful! If you want a salad and vegan anything...don't come here! lol This is a place where you just want to eat some comfort food and drink... away from all the craziness in the city. [REVIEW_12] Miss this little gem more than we could have ever imagined!! While living in Carp we frequented Siam almost every week. The owners are absolutely wonderful and you can't beat the setting. The food is freaking amazing and I've never had a pad thai dish that I've liked better. Definitely try the coconut; mango; sticky rice; it's like heaven! [REVIEW_13] Yesterday was the 2nd time I have ate there; both times late in the day. Yesterday I was on a ride and saw it; stopped in for food and to warm up. Chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes. Real potatoes. Gravy was ok; steak was just fine. Salad before was ok; tough to make a bad salad. Slice of pineapple upside down cake. All was a great meal. 3 sugar coffee; most places are 2 sugar for me. Waitress was wonderful(wonder if she's single? Lol). Prices were very good.  Nice place in the middle of almost no where(I live in largo) and you can tell they have quite a few regulars. [REVIEW_14] Very nice place; fast service; got our beers quick; patio is cool as hell; it was cheap. No complaints. Good ass place. [REVIEW_15] Best sushi in Tampa bay! So fresh and great service; and they have an awesome lunch special. [REVIEW_16] Great Cranberry Orange Muffin and Caffe Latte on a Saturday morning. Great ambience and fast service. [REVIEW_17] Great surprise sushi place. The miso soup was the best we have ever had; the house salad was actually good. I ordered Dinner Box A which came with four different items which three were fantastic and the steak over vegtables just ok. So we ordered more food. One eel and one tuna. That was amazingly fantastic. wow. I am really liked the sound of the waterfall. [REVIEW_18] The best! The staff are the cutest; friendliest people you'll ever meet. Food came out quick; reasonably priced; delicious and as described in the menu. They also serve these funky chips to eat while you're waiting on your meal. Would definitely recommend if you enjoy Thai. [REVIEW_19] Just had our Wedding here Saturday November 3rd at the Singleton Pavilion - was absolutely perfect.   We booked an ""off season"" wedding (Nov-Feb) so got the venue for about 1/4 the normal cost; the view was just amazing. Lush beautiful trees and well kept lawns made for the perfect day.  They had grounds keepers there the morning of to clean the restrooms and clean the grounds; also had parking attendants there to guide our guests to our venue.   If you do book Singleton versus their much larger venue Godric Grove the only major downside is the parking situation - you're guests have to walk quite a ways to get to your venue. And; besides electrical outlets and a sink - its pretty bare. No lighting anywhere so you need to be prepared to have all of the basic things covered.   The staff was perfect with communication during the booking process and called to confirm everything 1 week prior.   Very; very happy with this venue. Absolutely gorgeous! [REVIEW_20] The Penang chicken with the chicken flavor infused white rice will always be one of my favorite meals. Wether in Boston or in Philly; the quality is the same and I am a huge fan. When we came in the line was very long but surprisingly we were sat in about 15-20 minutes. The service was fast from start to finish so I didn't have to wait long before I could start eating the juicy amazing chicken. I was planning on getting an order to go to drive back to Virginia to eat but that seemed greedy so I didn't. I regretted that decision the second I got back home so next time; I will be greedy!",20
17,"[REVIEW_1] I've been doing DIP powder for years. Every time it lasts 3-6 weeks without chipping. I did my nails here for the second time and within a week I had two broken nails. I went back and they fixed it but within two days more nails were chipping off. The pedicures are nice with the stones but after spending almost $70 in everything and my nails looking this bad after only a week I will not be going back here again. [REVIEW_2] I concur with the other comments that this place is awful.   The service here was about as bad as I have ever seen.   The food arrived cold and had to be sent back - which of course turned into a big ordeal.    Until the management here shows some leadership and sets some higher expectations of their service and kitchen staff; I would avoid this place. [REVIEW_3] I went here for the first time yesterday; and I was so happy! I have been in Ardmore for over two years; but never went to this salon for a pedicure. I was always driving out of my way to somewhere in KOP. However; never again! I got the best pedicure I have ever had yesterday. They do the best job and Estela was amazing. Thank you olive nails  for the best experience; you'll be the only place I ever go back to. [REVIEW_4] I've been to a lot of Pho Restaurant but this is the worst one....  I've been to this restaurant 2 times....  First experience; I would like to try the new place after porkie the Korean BBQ closed.....and they over charged the bill.....The bubble drink is supposed to be $3.50 but they add an extra $3.....When I asked why they said Oh it's because we put the tapioca.....The drink itself already serve w/ the tapioca; therefore I do not understand why the extra charge is necessary.....  The second time; I gave another try......I went with 11 people and ordered their pho......I found out that the flanks were shining green.....which was clear to me that the meat quality is bad....it has FUNGI....they're ROTTEN!!!!  The worst thing was that it was not only my bowls but also others....So we asked the server NICELY if we could just changed all to the rice dishes instead and pay the extra.....but the first thing they did; flew to the kitchen and brought us the rare flank and argue that the meat was fine.....Like duhhhh one bowl is ok but it's like all 8 BOWLS WITH ROTTEN MEAT!!!!  Then the other server said; Oh I'm in charge and we couldn't change the food because it's already in the system....Excuse me; but I'm not there to eat for free and I said I'M GOING TO PAY FOR THE EXTRA CHARGES.....  We dealt with this for more than 20 minutes....just want to proof that they were right.......clearly they had no idea how to dealt with their customers....NO APOLOGIZE...NOTHING AND JUST KEPT ARGUING..... Definitely the worst dinner ever.....and WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this place at all to anybody.....I believe that you do not want to pay for rotten meat..... Better go to Viet Huong or Nam Phuong across from them....it's way better with the same price; better food quality and better service! [REVIEW_5] Texas Roadhouse does not give you the steak you ask for in the case. I have been here multiple times; asked for a specific steak; and have a steak come out for my meal that is a completely different steak. This is such a hoax; tourist attraction as part of the restaurants; and really dishonest. This restaurant shouldn't offer this if they cannot actually provide their customers with what they ask for. [REVIEW_6] I took my expensive Christian Louboutins here to be dyed since I had heard that this place was one of the best in the city. Boy; what an overstatement. I wanted my studded gray CLs dyed black. I SPECIFICALLY told them to please; please; please be careful not to get any dye on the red soles because that is what makes a Louboutin a Louboutin. I also asked if they could dye it without covering the studs. They told me YES. They would tape off everything that wasn't going to be dyed and it would turn out perfect. I came back a week later; like they told me. Only 1 shoe was half done. So they told me another week.  I came in to pick them up today to find the worst dye job I have ever seen in my life. There was black dye all over the studs; all over the inside and the toe box; and (worst of all) all over the red soles. Besides the damage; all of the gray had not even been dyed. There were random un-dyed patches everywhere. I told them that this was not the kind of work I was promised. Then they changed their story and said that it would have been impossible to tape off the studs. They said I should not have even tried to get them dyed. When I questioned why there is dye on the inside and why the red soles are covered in black dye splotches; they said ""I don't know"". They told me they could TRY to remove the dye but that the red might come off; too. I told them this is completely unacceptable. And then they gave me an attitude. They said ""Look; we already told you we could remove the dye. I don't understand why you keep standing here talking.""  If the job could not be done; they should have told me ahead of time. I understand it was a tedious job; what with all the studs; but there is no excuse for getting dye all over the inside and soles. He said the dye would come off as I walked. ....YOU DON'T WALK ON THE ARCHES OF THE HEELS. I asked for my money back and they told me they dyed my shoes like I asked; so what more do I want. I just took my shoes and left. They must be crazy to think I would leave my shoes there for them to ""fix"".  I instead took them to Superior Shoe Repair near 15th and Walnut. I have taken shoes there before; so I should've went there to begin with because I know they are used to dealing with designer shoes. They said they could fix it; so I will be reviewing them when I pick them up this week. [REVIEW_7] Way over -priced . Burgers are very dry and tough . [REVIEW_8] McDonalds... What do you need to know?..   They serve the purpose. I'd complain about the inaudible Spanish fellow working the drive through but why would I expect much else..  Update:  they just charged me .25 cents for ranch..  I'm pretty wealthy actually but this stuff is so annoying.  I handed him a dollar; took 4 of them and walked to the trash can to throw away 3 of them as I only needed one.  I feel I made my point.. [REVIEW_9] This restaurant smells like old; sour maple syrup. It's been ten hours and I can still smell it.  The food was terrible. I have no clue how this restaurant is in business. The eggs were mushy; slimy; and very watery. I took a few bites; but the flavor was so bad I couldn't eat anymore. I just can't understand how a restaurant that specializes in cooking eggs can be so bad at it. The potatoes were also gross; tasted like old dirty potatoes that were microwaved.  The coffee was really weak; too. It tasted like watered down tea.  I just can't stress enough how bad this restaurant is. Even the flower in the case on our table was dead. Stay away!!!!! I will say; the waiter and manager were very nice and friendly. [REVIEW_10] Prices are absolutely ridiculous! They charge almost $12 per item to dry clean. I should've realized something was amiss when I didn't see any signage that talked pricing. Shame on me for not asking first but every other place I've ever been charges $4 or less. The employee couldn't articulate what; precisely; causes the increase in price over the competition. I will assume that little angels kiss the clothes clean. [REVIEW_11] While friendly enough; too many mistakes were made for me to ignore. First; I didn't receive my soda; and had to go get my waiter and ask him for it again. Not too big a deal; but then my daughter's chicken enchilada...had no chicken. We'd already begun eating; and our waiter hadn't come around to see if everything was OK. I asked her if she wanted to send it back but she said no; so; fine. The food itself was OK. We were hungry; we ate it. Her kid's meal was around $6.50; my crispy tacos $7.50; and my soda was $2. I noticed the prices on the menu; but wasn't adding up my bill ahead of time or anything because that's; you know; the restaurant's job. So I didn't blink when a check totaling $22.51 came; and I didn't pay any mind about tipping %20 (despite the faults; I've been a server before; so I can understand). In the end I paid $28. It was after we were long gone that I realized the total Should have been closer to $16; not $22.51. Did I get the wrong check and not notice? Did they add gratuity to a teeny little party of two without even telling me? Either way; that's a big no-no; right?  I wasn't being on my toes I guess; but I still feel a little ripped off. Ultimately they received more money than I personally thought the whole experience was worth; hence my poor star rating. Oh; and my butt was on fire all the next day; so there. [REVIEW_12] I work in many areas throughout the Tampabay area!  Today I happened upon this beautiful ""old friend"" and was thrilled to see it still standing and doing business!!!  I was pleasantly surprised as I walked through the main doors and found it to be just as it was but actually even more beautiful!!!  I was in a hurry to meet a client so I decided I was going to place a to go order...:I asked the hostess for a to go order menu and she handed me one and then as I was looking over the menu I expressed my excitement for this place that I once loved so long ago!!!!  She said and I quote ""ARE YOU GOING TO PLACE A TO GO ORDER OR NOT?""  I very nicely handed the menu back to her and turned and left the restaurant!!!!!  Wow!!!!!!!! [REVIEW_13] Terrible service. Went at 1pm on a Saturday and waited 25 minutes for my order (there were 2 ppl ahead of me with normal; single sandwich orders). First; the guy didn't know how to make my sandwich (a black forest ham) and skipped to the next guy in line until he could get the girl in the back to come make it; leaving me just standing there getting passed over in line. He then put the condiments on and put on an insane amount of mustard. I didn't ask for extra; I just said mustard; thinking he'd run it back and forth 2 or 3 times and that's it. Nope; he squeezed the crap out of the bottle and completely drenched it. Then he can't work the cash register; only the girl can. Just one thing after another.    I then go out front to eat and hear a car at the drive thru placing an order on the touch screen kiosk (which is actually a really good idea); but the girl inside is telling them over the mic they have to come inside to order; that they can't place there order in the drive thru. Employees at this location seriously need some training or help. Go to another location if you can. [REVIEW_14] Probably the worst service ever... Was here on a Sunday evening with a group of 4 to get drinks and a couple apps.  My friend was served the wrong beer twice.  My drink took so long that the ice was melted by the time I got it.  I asked for a straw for my water and my server said ""there's no water in there."" No lie. Manager tried to fix the situation and she was polite and slightly more helpful.  The food we did receive was tasty; if cold. At least it was an entertaining night! [REVIEW_15] SoCal burger = so darn good!  So good; that I've eaten at Bareburger on at least 5 occasions; but always order the same darn thing!! Avocado; pickled onions; and I always add a little jalapeño for some extra heat ...  I also love that they deliver.  As such; Bareburger has been my default lunch option for rainy days when I'm in no mood to leave the office. [REVIEW_16] Can't believe this pit stays open. Like walking into a Fellini set. Disgusting. Dirty. [REVIEW_17] Paid $740 for a tailor made wedding suit and the sales person promised to deliver it in less than 5 days. That's it... End of story. My money is gone but I still don't have a suit... It's been close to a month since the purchase and I don't have anything to wear for the wedding. The customer service here is terrible.  The suit was shipped to the wrong address and after a few phone calls and follow ups I was told that they will recall the package and ship it to the right address. Another week goes by and guess what... My suit gets shipped to the wrong address AGAIN...  Sales person asks me to check with postal service and they ask me to check with the sender for updates... A classic game of ping ping.  All I've heard by far are false promises and I've lost my Cool. Wedding is nearing and I don't have my suit. All this is nothing but a waste of my money; time and patience. If I can give zero stars for the customer service I'd be glad to do so. Very unpleasant experience.  Hey nordstrom... Give me my suit or my money back.   PS: I'm never buying anything from here in the future. [REVIEW_18] Not impressed with this location.we to the drive thru yesterday to get a wonderful shake. The lady was taking one order at a time i mean you order you drive to pay and then when that vehicle leaves the property then the next person goes thru the same process kinda reminded me of when employees are not getting what they want so they cause a slow down. ..so I went inside thinking I'd get faster service it was 92 degrees on a Saturday night. Went inside a customer said they only have a total of 2 employees working here needless to say I didn't get my shake..I went back t h e next day today Sunday and ordered my shake I was told they were out of shakes.i asked when they would have more the lady said she didn't know. . [REVIEW_19] We ordered delivery because I'm sick at home. For $12 carnitas that was supposed to come with cilantro; onion and salsa; non of these was included. they came with only a little bit of meat in two taco shells and tasted unseasoned. My pork shoulder was very chewy and was supposed to come with pickles but didn't.  The beans; potato salad; and coleslaw were all filled less than half way. Only good things are the toasts. We will not order from this place ever again. [REVIEW_20] Both the woman who did my pedicure and the woman who did my massage where very nice; but for the price I paid for each it was not worth it!  The pedicure was $50 and it's equal to an express pedicure at other salons. Very disappointing. The massage was ok. But I would never ever return:(",2
18,"[REVIEW_1] Great food; amazing service!   This is a hidden gem in the area.   I hope more people go here!! [REVIEW_2] If you were able to give it more than 6 stars; I would. The first exposure to the duck I had was at the beer and bacon festival where they had their tomato soup with garlic pulverized bacon. It was so good they ran out about half way through the festival.  Last night was my first time at the actual restaurant. It was a large group so in total I tried the blue duck fries; general tso's wings; the pork roll burger; house blend burger; quack and cheese and classic Mac. If you have a large group make sure they want to share because you're going to want to try everything. It's all amazing and will make you want to come back the next day. Looking forward to trying the brunch menu.  The managers also stopped by our table since it was my friends birthday. They made sure everything was perfect and I was really impressed with the staff. [REVIEW_3] How do these guys not have any reviews yet?! Anna photographed our wedding in June of this year. She was absolutely fantastic. From the moment I chatted with her on the phone; I knew she'd be our gal for the big day. She was SO easy to talk to; none of her photos seem fake or posed; she was fun; got right in the center of things and delivered absolutely beautiful photos. I'm a gal who doesn't like to have her picture taken very much (not an especially great quality for a bride...) and she made it easy on me by getting great photos of our guests and family members (and of course; great ones of me and my fella...) Great communication the whole time; too. She was absolutely delightful and I'd recommend her to any couple looking for their photographer. [REVIEW_4] This place insults Chinese cuisine much like Olive Garden does to Italian. I'll shank someone w/ chopsticks if they ever suggested this dump. [REVIEW_5] I love this place! Highly recommend the pork waffle fry appetizer; whatever it's called. Also the five alarm burger with the five alarm sauce! Yum!!! Wasn't a fan of the jalapeño coleslaw; but it's not creamy so it's just different.  This place has a great vibe tho. Unique bottled beers. A nice patio with a smoking section. The service is always good! [REVIEW_6] Great bar off the lobby of the International Hotel in the CBD; a block off Canal St. We met a friend for drinks and we all had a variant of a Kir Royale made with Cava and a raspberry liqueur from St. George's Spirits in Alameda that was gorgeous. Service was friendly and prompt; and we enjoyed ourselves so much that we went back the next night to do it all over again. [REVIEW_7] Great food and a small-town feel! Angie is one of the sweetest people and makes you feel so very welcomed! [REVIEW_8] I really think when I walked into this store a choir of foody angels hovered above me and sang HALLELUJAH...This place is a mecca of gourmet foods and unique ingridients that home or seasoned chefs would use. You could literally build a basket for an episode of chopped in this store with minimal effort.  I came on a saturday and it was like walking through costco or sams club except instead of frozen crap it was gourmet goodness showcased for your tasting pleasure. Cured meats; nectars; baked goods; cheesecakes; chips; wine tastings; deli items; seafood dips; and all the stuff you can't find anywhere else in tucson lines the aisles of this store.   I have never been so awestruck by a grocer it was heavenly and I will gladly drive back again next time my culinary needs exceed the chops of safeway or fry's. [REVIEW_9] Mrs. Ken not only did a great job waxing my brows; but was transparent and consultative too. Before she started waxing she asked me to hold up a mirror; showed me where I had over-tweezed; and advised that I let them grow out. She then showed me exactly where she was going to wax. The waxing itself was much less painful than I had experienced before; and; dare I say; relaxing? Afterwards; she asked me to hold up the mirror again; showed me what she did; and advised me once again to let certain areas grow out for a month before revisiting.  Mrs. Ken is warm; professional; and great at her craft. I am so glad I found her and will only let her touch my brows for as long as I live in the area. [REVIEW_10] Wish I had read the reviews before we stopped for dinner.  When we arrived there were only two other tables of patrons and a handful of people at the bar.   They promptly took our food order; but we waited 50 minutes for it to be delivered.   It was only a burger and a pork tenderloin sandwich.   Not sure why we didn't leave other than the fact we were watching football.  Food was just ok.  The people at the bar were so loud; offensive and obnoxious that I felt uncomfortable for an older couple that was dining.    What kind of management allows this kind of behavior?     This place won't last. [REVIEW_11] After living in our house for 10 years; with one of us (not me) being a semi-hoarder; our garage had turned into a disaster of junk and trash and empty boxes.  So when the time came to clean it up before we put our house on the market I knew I was going to need to hire someone.  Not to mention I also had 2 mattress sets; a room of carpet; a broken sofa AND an old door that needed to be dumped.   Called Tobey's and was asked to text the information about my job to them.  Scheduled an appointment on my day off. They arrived a little after 9am and left around 1130 and did a great job of hauling off everything! What a weight off my shoulders to not have to worry about all of that crap.   Would def recommend Tobey's and if we were to need their services again in the Reno/Sparks area I would totally hire them again!  Thanks! [REVIEW_12] WOW! I've never seen an authentic Jazz concert until I came here! All Stars band was awesome! Very entertaining and definitely a must in NOLA. I love how they preserve the music genre. Very talented people! Place is small and will get packed! Buy your tickets online and get the assigned seating; or floor seating if you don't mind seating on the floor front row. Tip them please they deserve it. You can also do on-the-spot requests. No photography allowed during the show. And you can bring a drink from outside! [REVIEW_13] Great service - the owner has been out twice and got all my sprinklers working and installed a new controller. Definitely knows his trade! Don't hesitate if you have sprinkler problems! [REVIEW_14] This place is great!  The prices are reasonable for the quality of the clothes you find; most of what they carry is either new or like-new.  I always love finding the original price tags; even if they don't show the original prices.  Definitely check out the shoes and clearance area!  Workers are nice; and tend to keep to themselves; though they are very attentive when you ask for help. [REVIEW_15] Finding a place where I can take my daughter whose is gluten and dairy intolerant and a vegetarian and picky as hell is impossible. These guys make the impossible possible. She was thrilled and everything I ate was fantastic. For those non-vegetarian non-gluten free and non-dairy free you'll love it.   I had biscuits and gravy with a side of pork sausage. You must try this. One of the best biscuits and gravy I have ever had.   The owners are a truly nice couple. Go out of your way to eat here. It's worth it. [REVIEW_16] Totally in love with the platter for two. We ordered pork shoulder and arrachera beef; which were both perfectly cooked! The cauliflower side was really good as well. Love the sauce on the side; btw. As for dessert; we ordered churros which was perfect for sharing! Had a relaxing and fun night at the restaurant:) [REVIEW_17] The smell hits you as soon as you're near the door. Smells amazing! The Turkey Supreme is delicious and the Italian Beef is so flavorful and tender! [REVIEW_18] Haven't had their sushi (yet); but hibachi chicken exceeded expectations on 5 fronts: speed; presentation; taste; price; and ability to customize (I asked to make mine light on the salt). The size was impressive too. [REVIEW_19] This is the best gym I've ever been a member of. It's clean; up to date; huge; bright and fun. The machines are top of the line and the staff is always friendly. Just stay away on Mondays! There are no parking spots and no available machines.  The only bad thing is the love songs they play on the sound system. I mean really; we're there to get pumped up and workout not listen to sappy love songs that just slow down your rhythm and mood! [REVIEW_20] Probably the perfect ""cakery"" in the planet. It's tucked in a converted home. Once you step inside; you won't even realize you're in Indy. It's like one of those French cafes   This place is one of those places that you will probably see in the big metro spaces in the country. It's beautifully designed and no expense was spared. From carerra marble tables to monogrammed champagne flutes; this place is a sight to see.  As for cakes; expect to splurge. Don't be all cheap. Expect little less than $10 for a slice of cake. My fave is the owner's fave as well which is the caramel cake. All I can say is omg-  where has this place been. It looks ordinary but definitely a winner in the taste department. I can honestly say that this is probably my favorite cake ever.",18
19,"[REVIEW_1] BrightNow Dental was an ok dentist until I made an appointment & went in that morning at my scheduled time just to be turned away because I missed an appointment a few months before. Which was because of family emergencies. I even called & left messages on their answering machines to reschedule & they never called me back. So my tooth started hurting really bad & I made an appointment. Went in & the dentist turned me away with an excruciating hurting tooth just bcuz I missed an appointment a few months before. I've never been turned away from a doctor or dentist before. I found it to be very unprofessional from the dentist standpoint because he didn't even talk to me. The assistant did. I will never go back & I will not recommend this dentist to anyone. [REVIEW_2] I've been to Desi Chaat a lot and wanted to try another place; so I went down the street to Mood Cafe.  There is one guy behind the counter who spent a while asking me what sorts of food I liked and what spice I can handle.  I asked him to explain all of the ingredients and he went through them one by one.  It was very informative and interesting; and I appreciated his excitement and knowledge about the different flavors and combinations.  We eventually decided on the crazy chaat; a blend of a lot of chaats.  I say ""we"" decided because he took my feedback - and perhaps my mood - into account.  I would venture to say the chaat was life-changing; but I'm also a huge fan of Indian food and chaat so count that as my bias.  In any event; because of the good vibes of this place and the ridiculously delicious food; I will surely be back. [REVIEW_3] Love this place. Come in sit in the back;  relax and have some me time.  They have all types of spiritual  items for sale. Really nice gifts too. [REVIEW_4] This was a great place to stay. We were in town for a water polo tournament. Jesse was amazing at accommodating our group and went above and beyond. He made our stay wonderful! [REVIEW_5] Terrible establishment.  Poor service. The bouncers do not have any restraint. If you are female they will grab you aggressivley. ..very hostile. I have had a few terrible experiences there and I share them with everyone I meet so they know what they are getting into when they go there. Don't waste your time or your money when Nashville has so many other awesome places to offer! [REVIEW_6] I shop here on the regular. Good quality authentic product. Im first generation and brought up on home made polish food. Thanks Czerw's for the taste of home! [REVIEW_7] Dean's Service was not professional or reliable at all.  I called to get a diagnosis and they got to my rental property and gave me misinformation.  I left messages for Jenny to call me back to get an estimate and a good time to complete the repair and I am still waiting for her to call me back. I had to call another company to do what Dean's Service was unable to do.  I will never call them back again nor would I refer them to anyone. [REVIEW_8] I haven't eaten here in a while because a friend of mines quit; due to rude employers. But I was just starving. I went to order an omelette with the veggies wrapped inside instead of cooked in. I was told that I could not have it that way. Once I asked why??? Both cashiers snapped at me and told me that the cook had the right to make it however he pleased and couldn't I see how busy they were. And they didn't have anytime to special make my order.... After a verbal argument between me and the staff the had to nerve to ask if I still wanted to order. This place has good food but very very poor customer service skills. I will never spend my money there ever again... The worst service I have ever received. [REVIEW_9] I would give this place 0 stars if I could. We went during Sunday happy hour and I specifically asked our waitress about specials and she told me brunch was over and there were no other specials. Come to find out there was a whole happy hour menu and 2 of the beers we ordered were on happy hour but we were charged full price. The waitress was not apologetic; just annoyed when I confronted her and said ""I didn't know you wanted happy hour"". I was confused because it is the first thing I asked her whenever she finally decided to greet our table.  She also rarely came to our table to check on us. Go elsewhere; there are plenty of better places in the area to eat and drink. [REVIEW_10] The donut Paninis are outstanding. The Kolaches are delicious. There isn't a thing on the menu I didn't want to try. My heart is so lucky we do not live in the neighborhood. [REVIEW_11] The steak is okay. I give it a 1 because it's not worth the price. Very expensive. You can find a much better steak at other restaurants in town. Plus; my experience was dampened by some annoying couple trying to sell me real estate as I ate at the bar. [REVIEW_12] I just had the worst experience with We Love Pets! It was not so much a specific problem with a product or a pet; but how poorly they handled a situation. I was scheduled to have dog my dog groomed as that is a new service they are providing.  My hsuband scheduled the first appointment for me to bring the dog on my day off; and I have to admit; a week later I completely forgot about it and did not bring her in.  We rescheduled for the following week; the day of the big snow storm and hence i cancelled the appointment. Last week was the third try; however the groomer was sick! So we tried again for today; making it late in day so that I would be able to take the dog in the afternoon as soon as I got home from work. Last night they left a message requesting we bring the dog in the morning. Today I spoke with them in the middle of the morning ; letting them know I was home sick; was trying to coordinate things; and would try to bring her in a little earlier; between 12 and 1. AT 1230 my phone rings could I bring her in immediately. Unfortunately; I am quite sick and was trying to coordinate doctors visit etc so it was going to be 1 pm when I would bring in my dog. I explained that I was unsure why they were calling as I had already agreed to move the time up one hour.  I was then told to hold on; and then told; not to bother and not to reschedule as this was the third time I had missed an appointment! NOT TRUE!!! I fully admit to missing the first appointment; and I had not yet missed todays appointment!  Before cancelling my appointment; they told me that their groomer was sitting there with nothing to do; so they wanted me to bring the dog in earlier. Is that my problem; that the groomer's schedule is not yet fully booked? They then told me they weren't supposed to schedule it that late. There again; it was their error in not educating their staff in the rules for scheduling grooming and this error was repeated multiple times when they continued to reschedule late in the day.  When I tried to explain my perspective; they hung up on me. So; my rating are for POOR PROFESSIONALISM and POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! [REVIEW_13] Nothing more to say than this is the BEST donut place ever. I literally wished they shipped their products. When I moved to Florida; I missed it so much. It's only in New Orleans... sad face! [REVIEW_14] Never been a big fan of this place. Food is very mediocre; nothing special by any stretch but our last experience with Cafe Roma was just ridiculous.   We ordered online..waited an hour and then called to politely check on our order and got attitude by the person answering saying it typically takes 45 mins but its only been 59 mins. not an hour. Ok. So another 15 mins passes when my genius bf notices that he mis-typed his phone number so he calls to correct his mistake and was told that the food would not be coming. Period. We were shocked. Even without the phone number; they had our full address and we were not very far from the restaurant. They did not attempt to deliver; and had no intention of doing so.   No excuse for such unprofessional service. Shame; shame; shame. [REVIEW_15] Daria is a godsend! Twice now when my boyfriend and I have had to leave town; she's watched our two kitties and done a fantastic job. One of our cats is not super social; and she LOVES Daria. So much so that when she came to get the key; our cat came running to her - she doesn't do that for anyone! That's how you know your animals are being well loved in your absence. I don't have to stress; knowing that my babies are being taken care of. And she comes to your house! No worrying about upsetting your animals by having to board them somewhere. Also; it's incredibly simple to set up - now that we're acquainted; all I had to do was text to set up a house sitting arrangement for 8 days. I don't know what I'd do without Daria and Soulard Pet Sitters. If you're looking over your pet sitter options; pick this one. Trust me. [REVIEW_16] I didn't enjoy my experience at Clayton nails today 7/3/2015. It was all because of the nail tech; i didn't get her name but she was young; Vietnamese with a med length bob haircut. I went in for a gel color polish change. Her work is not as neat as what im use to there. She for some reason placed two scolding hot towels over each of my hands while removing the old color. I told her that the towels were too hot and she than removed them and swung them in the air to cool off than reapplied. She than asked 'is this better princess "".  Than she turned around and ask if that woke me up. I've had a gel polish color change several times before; no one has ever placed hot towels on my hands EVER;  i don't know why she did. After the gel color polish was applied and dry she repeatedly reapplied a top thick coat over and over. I kept having to place my hands under the uv light again; thats never happened before either. I guess i have to pick one person to go to and stick to them religiously. [REVIEW_17] FINALLY SOMEBODY GIVING SWEETIE PIES SOME TYPE OF COMPETITION!   Had the smoked pork steak it was excellent - so tender it was falling to pieces! I also had enough to take home & warm up later.   The dressing was tasty as well - a difficult feat.  Didn't get to try the banana pudding or shrimp and grits but I'll definitely make my way back! [REVIEW_18] Nordstom's has always been a class act; and I'm thrilled that it remains so. Hats off to Tamika B in the lingerie department!  I phoned her desperate for an item that my local Cherry Hill Nordstrom did not stock.  The item arrived at my home in 3 days!  Now. that's service! Thank you! [REVIEW_19] I'll admit Thai food is new to me; but I have a feeling I'll be having it more often after my experience at Thai Orchid.  We went on a Saturday afternoon and got seated right away.  The waitress was very friendly; and concerned for my wife when she ordered the spiciest thing on the menu.  She doesn't know my wife very well :)  I ordered the drunken noodles; which was had 2 peppers next to it; denoting the spiciness.  It was pretty damned spicy; which I liked; but I was actually sweating!  The taste of the dish was DELICIOUS!  Yes i just yelled that.  Overall; I give this restaurant 2 thumbs up; and will definitely be returning. [REVIEW_20] My partner stopped here on her way after work to pick up a carryout order. The cashier refused to accept her groupon because her tablet was not connected to the internet. So; she called me at home to make the 20 minute drive to her location to use my device (which has a data plan) to complete the purchase. Upon arriving; I asked the cashier ""If you were in my shoes; what would it take to make this order worth it; considering that the pizza will be 40-50 minutes old by the time we get home?"" The cashier's response was to assure me that delivery customer's pizzas were at least this old by the time they received them. I took this to mean that no; this was indeed not worth the headache. We refused the order; cancelled our groupon purchase and took our business elsewhere.",10
20,"[REVIEW_1] Myron and perma ceram were recommended to me by a contractor/friend.  My tub had some rust and chipping which was explained to Myron when we were scheduling the job.  The price seemed reasonable; so I said okay.  Mike came out a few days later and was a nice guy.  He took a look at the tub and said the repairs would be no problem.  He said he can fix the rust and the tub would look like new. After he was finished and he was paid I was handed a receipt/invoice. Once Mike leaves;  I read what he handed me and at the end it states there is no warranty for rust.  What!  Why wouldn't you say that to me.  I just would have bought a new tub for the price.    Once the tub dried; I could get a closer look and there were several areas it appeared weren't sanded down so there were ridges along several edges.  Not a new tub; so I could live with that.  Fast forward; a couple months went bye and what do you know; I could see the rust coming through. So I call Myron to schedule an appointment and after months of run around; I get a call asking if they can come Christmas Eve. Seriously!  Needless to say they finally said they were too busy to come to the city.  Essentially go pound sand.    Beware. [REVIEW_2] MmmmmmMmmm. You can find a philly cheesesteak at almost every corner in the city but it's nearly impossible to find a place that sells really good italian sausage sandwiches and italian roast beef.  George's Sandwich Shop is located right in the Italian Market area. Order an italian sausage sandwich and you have a choice of sweet; hot; or *burn my ass* peppers..  The sandwiches here are enormous and very satisfying.  They also have tripe sandwiches; hot dogs; crab cake sandwiches. Funny quote discovered here: ""Don't divorce your wife if she can't cook...eat here and keep her as a pet."" :) [REVIEW_3] Had the daily special; blackened ribeye I think it was; delicious steak; cooked and seasoned perfectly. Mashed potatoes were absolutely delicious. When I want a good steak; this would definitely be my choice. I haven't been able to find a better steak. [REVIEW_4] I purchased a $199 Groupon for ZOOM! whitening at Patelka Dental. Before I purchased my Groupon I called Patelka to confirm it was the full ZOOM! process. The women confirmed that yes; it is ZOOM! and it was the full 4-15 minute sessions. I purchased my Groupon and called back and made my apt.   The day before my apt. I get a call from Patelka telling me they need to move my appointment until the follow week as they didn't have anyone in the office that day to perform the ZOOM!; I ask to have an apt the day before and she explains that they are booked solid with ZOOM! apts. About an hour later I get another call back saying they are able to fit me in; AWESOME! I take a half day off work so I can make the new appointment time. I get yet another call back saying they have to cancel my new appointment because they do not have enough supplies to accommodate me. I question how they do not have the supplies for me if they just booked my appointment? The lady quickly notes that they do not do ZOOM! that they do Lumebrite. ( NOT WHAT I PURCHASED or what I was told earlier ) I explain to her that my Groupon is for ZOOM! not Lumebrite. I ask for a refund. She refuses to bring me in for the ZOOM! that and refuses to refund me. I ask to speak with a manager or owner; (who is unable to come to the phone ) So I ask that she call me back asap as my appointment is for the following day and i took off work. The woman on the phone tells me I can expect a call tomorrow. When I receive my call from the manager (Natalie) She is RUDE; disrespectful; and I could not get a word in edge wise.   Thank goodness Groupon refunded me promptly and politely. I have never had worse customer service. I would never trust these people with my teeth. Save your money and your time. IT IS A SCAM!  I would never recommend them to anyone. [REVIEW_5] Worst sales man ever. I don't remember his name since he gave us someone else's business card. My girlfriend and I went into look at the jeep renegade and compare it to the patriot. The salesman shows us to a base model patriot let's us take it out awkwardly sits in the back and gives us one word answers on all our questions. I asked about fuel economy and he flat out lied said the car gets well over 30 mpg which it does not. Then tells us there are some great incentives on this car but doesn't explain what they are or how much they are. We come back not really liking the car he asks us how much we want to spend we say a low number he laughs and walks away and says to look online at their used cars and come back. We ask to see the car we came to see and he dosent even acknowledge our request;I asked about a truck I was interested in and he wouldn't even let me look at it or take it for a test drive. This is the worst customer service I have ever received we could have possibly bought two cars from this dealership but I will be taking my business elsewhere.   It sounds like another reviewer had issues with the same sales man; he should really be fired for making this business look so bad. [REVIEW_6] DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A CALIFORNIA LICENSE! I would literally give this place 0 stars if I could. I've never felt the urge to write a review before but I'm just so dumbfounded with how I was treated this evening. The bouncer was the rudest person I've ever met. I was very patient and polite with him when it was my turn and I smiled at him when he shined the light on me and that's when he asked me for another form of ID. This was foreign to me because I've literally never had anyone question my PASSPORT ID! I told him no and he made me leave (grabbed me when I tried to get my friends attention to tell her they wouldn't let me in). So I'm already annoyed and I kind of made a scene but I went all the way to my car to grab my license (which doesn't have my picture cause I'm from WA and I renewed via mail) and my debit card which has my picture on it as well. I wait in the long line again only for him to tell me ""I don't believe these are you"" without even looking at my 2 new forms of ID. He didn't even try to ask me any specific questions to see if it's me (ID #; weight; etc) he just singled me out of my group of 15+ people like an as*hole. I was literally so confused at this man trying to tell me that multiple pictures of me are not me... Needless to say; I'm going to make a phone call or two tomorrow because this is unacceptable and very unprofessional and should not be tolerated. [REVIEW_7] We tried to stop in and wait for a table for the second night in a row. The hostess was utterly useless. She refused to tell us how many tables were in front of us; rough estimate of how long it would be (other than a while); and wouldn't tell us how long a to go order would be. There were empty tables everywhere so I didn't understand why there was such a long wait.   Since we did eat there the night before and we were trying to go back; the food was good. Best cheesecake my fiancé ever had. My steak was cooked well and flavorful. My baked potato was cold when it came out. Bread was yummy. But the service sucks so bad; I wouldn't recommend it. [REVIEW_8] Very disappointing. I forced my husband to come with me and we stopped in for dinner. Service reeked of discrimination from the host to the server. Paid way too much for to eat sub par; cold; salty noodles; and bonus; get racially profiled. Management please do better. St. Pete is progressive and diverse. You need to know this. [REVIEW_9] This is our go to spot for happy hour.  Half price margarita pitchers and great food. I love their smoked wings; texas style chili; steak tacos; and turkey BLT.  Actually i've never had a bad meal here.  When in doubt we go to el camino and always end up having a great meal and wondeful time. [REVIEW_10] This place is phenomenal; albeit busy as heck because everyone in the neighborhood and beyond wants their buffet. The waitstaff hustles and bustles to get to everyone. You definitely need to try their bread pudding  (more appropriately titled; banana bread pudding). All in all; excellent food and the waitstaff are in good spirits. [REVIEW_11] I went in for a manicure and I will not be coming back. I walked in and immediately wanted to leave. It was so uncomfortably hot and stuffy. As I was choosing the color the girl came up to me and asked if I was ready. Less than a minute later she comes up to me again and asks if I'm ready. So rude.  When I did sit down for the manicure; she did not take good care of me. She barely used the nippers on my cuticles or skin and filed my nails crooked. Then she left half way through my manicure to do three eyebrow waxings. As if this weren't bad enough; she got polish on my fingers and missed a sizable amount on my pinkies. I will not be returning to this establishment and I hope you will not either. Go to LyLy's across the highway. Better customer service and quality manicure! [REVIEW_12] I didn't like this place at all. Those devil eggs things were disgusting and this seems more of a bar than a restaurant. Good bloody Mary's but that was it [REVIEW_13] AaaaahhhhhMAZING!!!!! If you want the true flavor of New Orleans in a neighborhood diner full of ambiance... this is the place!!! The sweet potato waffle is the best.... no wait; the pecan pancake - or maybe the banana pancake... and crab cakes... and chicken...  okay - it's ALL great! [REVIEW_14] I came to Shepards for a Memorial Day Weekend party and I was impressed. The last time I was here was as a kid - now that I'm older I can appreciate the place for its waterfront party atmosphere. The place had a huge crowd and plenty good-looking people mingling; while some DJs spun the latest hits. 93.3 hosted this party and as usual it drew crowds beyond the typical Clearwater Beach and holiday crowds. Make sure you get there early to find some good parking.  The drinks were made well - packed a punch and although the waitress had a bit of an attitude; we did feel a little bad for her with so many party animals around. The drinks had plenty of alcohol; although they were average to expensive in pricing. I would probably pre-game before heading to Shepards. I saw at least 4 people pass out from drinking during our visit. We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express next door which is perfect walking distance from Shepards.   Catching the sunset from here was awesome and the mini-beach made for some great photo opportunities as well. The nightclub called The Wave seemed pretty cool as well; although we only sutck around for short time. I will certainly be back for future partying. [REVIEW_15] Server was super friendly and nice but after putting in our order; we never saw him for over 30 mins. He came to tell us our food would be out shortly;  that meant another 30 mins; yes it took over an hour for our food to show up. Even then we had to get someone else to bring us forks and napkins; no one even found us knives. Dry chicken in a southwest salad; bland quesadilla;  very average burger but all at higher prices than normal. Asked for hot sauce and server came to table 3 times and made excuses each time of why he did not have with him. He was a trainer and taking care of other servers was more important than taking care of his own customers. Terrible service; bad food;  high prices; i think Jimmy himself would be embarrassed with this place; will never be visiting this chain again just because of this experience. [REVIEW_16] I went to the drive thru hopefully I can get served so was at the speaker for half hour and lady had a attitude cause we asked if we could get service to say they had to change till and several cars left in the process I had to go home hungry that was totally sad luckily I not a diabetic [REVIEW_17] Not impressed by the food or service.  Visited them for brunch about month ago and will not be back.  Overpriced mimosas ($7 each for a small champagne flute is ridiculous) and the food was just average.  My husband and I left because we felt very uncomfortable after the table next to us ordered salad; which they were out of lettuce; then french toast; which they were out of syrup; and a couple of other items I can't recall.  Oh; and no table visit by a manager!! I can't believe this place is still in business.  Our bill was $50 for 4 small mimosas; an egg & cheese bagel; and an omlet!  What a ripoff!!! [REVIEW_18] When I was with Charter 10 years ago their service was intermittent and customer service was horrendous. I've been a happy customer of AT&T DSL for the last eight years; but was repeatedly approached by Charter stating that they are now the best in the country; their whole network was revamped and that they now have zero issues. I signed up with Charter as of August 1 and the last 4 days were horrendous. The initial tech who was setting up the service was entirely incompetent and was asking ME questions about the router and the modem. The connection was lightning fast for about 2 days. As of yesterday the signal became weak; pages are taking 30-45 seconds to load and sometimes there is no connection at all. I called Charter and spent 15 minutes on hold; then talked to someone who hung up on me and was finally able to schedule a technician to bring a ""signal booster"" to my place. I live in Central St. Louis; not in a rural area; so apparently their ""best in the nation"" network still leaves much to be desired. [REVIEW_19] My experience here was all around very positive. My waitress was extremely attentive and helpful; from explaining many menu items individually and catering to our table as if we were the only ones there.   I ordered the nachos and Mexican corn as my appetizers. The nachos came in huge portions and very stuffed with cheese; jalapeños etc. So delicious! The Mexican corn was very flavorful and not too spicy; which I really appreciated.  The table came with complimentary chips and salsa which was very light and appropriate before starting the meal. A nice touch. Chips could've been more salty but overall everything was still fine as the salsa gave good flavor.  I ordered the enchiladas which were a bit too bean-y for my taste.   Great service and nice; clean atmosphere. Food is terrific. I would definitely recommend! [REVIEW_20] I went In For a diagnostic. Told the issue (that is unrelated to this post)....afterwards my car would not start. So the mechanic put my car in neutral ....not drive....and then it started. It did not do that to begin with.....so when I got home it would not park!!!! And I didn't go for that problem at all!!!!!",7
21,"[REVIEW_1] What's the point of setting a pick up time for a ToGo order when you end up waiting 30mins after that to get your food anyway?? The restaurant wasn't busy in the slightest; and it literally took over 30 minutes from the time I was supposed to pick up my order for them to actually bring out my to go order. I could've walked in and ordered food; and I would've gotten it faster. [REVIEW_2] My husband and I went here right before they were closing because we were in the neighborhood and needed some items for a recipe we were planning to make the next day.  I was super disappointed in this food outlet.  The meat section looked AWFUL; most of the meat was turning brown and the whole back of the store smelled like rotten food.  Like I said; it was around closing time; but it totally turned me off and gave me a ""gut feeling"" that I shouldn't buy anything from this store.  The layout was also a bit unorganized.  I will not be back. [REVIEW_3] My most recent conversation with Comcast (copy and pasted). I'm obviously ""User Guest"".

It really shouldn't take a whole month just to get some freakin Internet! [REVIEW_4] Scheduled a consult with this firm; was 20 minutes late. Thank god it was just a phone consult. Receptionist was rude and didn't seem to value my time. No apology was given for the tardiness. Told her that i was going to look elsewhere and she said ok and hung up.   Maybe they don't care about clients for traffic tickets. If i had been given an apology or felt like they actually cared; i would have continued with them.   Let's see if they respond to this review. [REVIEW_5] Finally went in after walking by so many times. Glad we did. Small place but IR is pleasing to the eye. One wall cover with wood palates and subtle two tone gray walls. Started with the prosciutto fig arugula Parmesan flatbread appetites. Enough for two people and delicious. Nice mix of flavors. Main dishes were a burger grass fed beef with fries coated with truffles dusting. Burger was humongous!  Looked good smelled good and tasted good. I had a seafood soup with fish ( not sure what it was) shrimp and mollusks in a  coconut/ curry broth. Deliciously spicy but not enough to kill your taste buds. Overall I would recommend this place. We went early as we heard it gets crowded and they do not take reservations.  BYW great wine and craft beer selections [REVIEW_6] 5 stars; as far as sports bars go. Awesome atmosphere with tons of TVs; high ceilings which allows for huge projectors to show games; great service; prices and food. For my gluten free eaters; the tortilla chips and fries are both gluten free. They also use a separate fryer from their breaded goods; so no cross contamination! Try the Buffalo Chicken nachos... the chicken is grilled; so no worries there. It is covered in cheese sauce and bleu cheese; too. I opted for extra buffalo sauce for more balance between hot and cheesy. I got the bacon cheeseburger with no bun; which was made from high quality sirloin. It was incredibly good! Their mixed drinks didn't skimp on the alcohol either. High recommended. Can't wait to go back! [REVIEW_7] If you're entertained by gambling as an end in itself - if you enjoy spending an evening actually trying to win some money - Western Village is really one of the best places in Reno.  For example; there's a poker pay table ""10/7 Double Bonus Poker."" that; if played perfectly; returns 100.7% of your money. Since casinos rarely like to lose money; it's extremely rare to run across. I found it at Western Village; on the 50-play machines. And they weren't even advertising it - they just slipped it in.  Sadly; I guess too many people caught on; and they eventually reduced it to 9/6/5 - which is still an almost 98-percent payback. Good enough that you really don't need to walk in expecting to lose.  Same goes for the tables - you're usually going to find pretty much the least restrictive rules that you can find in a Nevada casino.  This place doesn't have a lot of glitz or glamour; it doesn't have much in the way of comps; but it's a great place to gamble. [REVIEW_8] I take out-of-towners to Ralphs to experience authentic South Philly Italian food.   Ralph's never disappoints.  It may not be fancy; but it's classic and damn good.  They are best known for their veal specials; but make a pretty mean chicken  or eggplant parmesan; too.  Other good choices are the antipasto; gnocchi; mussels; and Italian sausage.   But folks are right; the spaghetti is just OK.  Make reservations; and don't forget to bring your patience (it can get loud and crowded); cash; and plenty of friends. [REVIEW_9] There is a banner on the website that says ""free shipping over $50"". This company hates honoring this promotion and it's always a a hassle to get the free shipping and they conveniently have the shopping cart set up to always charge the shipping fee even if your order total qualifies for the free shipping. Anyway; my order total came to $160 but I was still charged shipping at checkout. So I called cust svc and spoke to an idiot beyotch that was hostile and completely mathematically challenged and illogical; as her defense was that since I used a coupon on my order; I should be okay with paying the shipping fee. Huh?! When that excuse didn't work; she then said I wasn't charged shipping for the conditioner (I had 4  items on my order). Umm; that makes no sense; as I'm still paying shipping on the other items (that are packaged in the same box as the ""freely shipped"" conditioner); plus the  shipping fee is a flate rate; so what good is it if one item out of 4 is shipped free?!  I have spent hundreds of dollars w/ this company but will never ever shop here again. My advice to all consumers is to bankrupt companies that don't appreciate your business. [REVIEW_10] The kid at the front desk refused to get a manager or supervisor after I asked. The kid named derick told me I was touchy...very rude. Turns out the supervisor was nearby and I talked to him. (They all gave me different info so I gave up). The AC did not work properly in room. The restaurant and breakfast ran out of certain food items. The valet parking(only parking there) was backed up. They werent ready for a busy week but they were ready to jack up the price. [REVIEW_11] Dangerous.  They are OK with life endangering; lazy repairs.  My wife insists on taking her Saturn there because they used to be a Saturn dealer.  She recently bought a new set of overpriced tires and these pitiful pukes did not put in new valve stems.  Down to about 13 psi by the time she got home.  The worst.  She took my truck there for a surprise gift oil change once which I really appreciated until SURPRISE; oil all over the garage due to finger tight plug.  Buffoons [REVIEW_12] Expected better with all the hype. Tastes like bland day old pizza with a rubber crust. And I watched them make it. Perhaps this ""under new management"" thing has something to do with it? [REVIEW_13] If I could give zero stars I would. This is the worst store in this area. I bought a tree stand and was told I could return the product within 30 days if the stand did not fit our tree. Shortly after Christmas I came by to return a $9 tree stand as it did not fit. I was then told by their manager; Rosa; that their policy has always been all Christmas items are final sale. They wouldn't even consider store credit but just flat out refused to do anything. So; do not trust the person at the checkout counter and definitely avoid any Christmas items as you will not be allowed to return anything. Everything is final sale it seems. So; Kmart Goleta; consider me a permanent loss of a customer. I'd rather go to amazon. At least they understand customer service. [REVIEW_14] Food is not bad (i.e.; standard Cosi glorified fast food).  However this particular restaurant has the rudest employees I have ever met in my life.  Asking for a fork is a huge burden on them for which I must apologize.  I am SO sorry I need a fork to eat a salad.  Also the workflow here is weird.  They act like you're a huge idiot for not knowing you order salad at one end and soup at the registers.  Signs might help.  Tomato basil was dec though. [REVIEW_15] We came here for an early mothers day celebration as we were on the quest to find a nail salon that could accommodate 4 pedicures at the same time. They were very friendly and even though they didn't have 4 pedicurists on the schedule that day they added one to accommodate us. That was really nice of them as they could have easily told us no.   The place itself is decorated very modern and offers a very clean; minimalist atmosphere. Upon walking in we were immediately greeted and after we checked in with the front desk we were asked what we wanted to drink. They had complimentary mimosas; wine and champagne; the perfect way to begin to unwind. Once we picked out our polish colors we were well on our way to getting our pedicures. Everyone was so nice and made us feel comfortable and welcomed. My polish never chipped the whole time I had it on. I will definitely be back.   The only downside is that its street parking only; which isn't something that they can control. They told us most of their business comes from people who work in the CBD so parking probably isn't an issue for their regular customers. Aside from parking being an issue I would definitely go to Buff again. [REVIEW_16] Very cool place. The food is fresh and delicious and the donuts are so unique and seriously good!! I have had the fried chicken sandwich as well as the burger sliders and both have been divine! Highly recommend. [REVIEW_17] Yummy yummy yummy is all I can say! I've come here for drinks before; but tonight I decided to order dinner; and I wasn't disappointed! My caprese burger was juicy; flavorful; and absolutely delicious; the nachos were delightful; and the frozen strawberry margarita made me a happy girl!! The crowd of people dining in were pleasant; and everyone was thoroughly enjoying the live music up front; the decor was lively and colorful which just tied up my experience with a shiny bow! Not a single complaint; just a fun dinner out! [REVIEW_18] He had the she crab soup and I had lobster bisque. Both were amazing! Rest atmosphere. Bree is terrific waitress! [REVIEW_19] There are not enough superlatives! Awesome food; drink and personnel!! I can't wait to get back to Santa Barbara and Chase!! Terry [REVIEW_20] Ultimate man cave for Sunday football games. Gets a little crowded but this is the place to be. Freezing beer and great food",10
22,"[REVIEW_1] Be careful at this shop. They like their money and that's it. When they mess up they just give you the run around about EVENTUALLY fixing it. Nikki the manager is rude and Molly won't fix a tat she messed up. [REVIEW_2] I absolutely hate coming here to pick up a package. It's difficult to locate and they have terrible service. They are not even set up for customer traffic at all! And I only came here because it's impossible to set up a convenient time for a package delivery at my home. [REVIEW_3] Third Degree was commissioned to create an Eternal Light for our synagogue's new sanctuary in Deerfield; IL. This is one of the most sacred of fixtures in our new sanctuary. Together with our architect; Finegold + Alexander; a design and concept of both metal and glass was conceived. With guidance from Riggo Design; a metal artist in Chicago; Third Degree engaged Troco Custom Fabricators to jointly create the eternal light.  None of the parties involved in this project had ever designed an eternal light. We did our research; discussed various concepts and then worked with Doug Auer and Michael Moran for the implementation. We then held our breath as Third Degree and Troco did their work.  The result is magnificent: A breathtaking sculpture that has our congregation in awe!  The only thing better than the fixture itself was getting to know Doug and Mike and their genuine hearts - which illuminated everyone in the process. [REVIEW_4] Both the woman who did my pedicure and the woman who did my massage where very nice; but for the price I paid for each it was not worth it!  The pedicure was $50 and it's equal to an express pedicure at other salons. Very disappointing. The massage was ok. But I would never ever return:( [REVIEW_5] What an amazing find this little place is.  We had time before our Busch tour and since Sage is right across the street; we decided to try it. I can say again how glad I am that we did. There were 3 of us and we each decided on something different. One got the Asian wrap and made 'yum' noises the entire time we ate. I opted for the Fried Tilapia Reuben - a strange idea if I ever heard one. It was so good that I havent stopped talking about it since I got back. Something about the richness of the batter with the fattiness of the oil made it so reminiscent of Rubens that it was amazing (of course; I havent had a real Ruben since I started keeping kosher some 30+ years ago; so that might have something to do with it as well) The sweet potato fires that accompanied each of our dishes was also a standout. While they have become almost ubiquitous; these seemed to be made from scratch and not just purchased frozen bagful at a time. I'd go back in a St Louis minute [REVIEW_6] Customer service here is actually awful. Had a girl named Danea (not sure if spelling as she did not wear a name tag). She asked me what I wanted to order and was gossiping to a coworker about god-only-knows while I was speaking. When she brought the wrong item and I told her what I had actually ordered; she snapped back ""you didn't say that!"" Um; yes I did. You clearly weren't listening. She re-made the order while sighing loudly. When she brought the new item back; she walked away to  gossip AGAIN near the store's walk-in. When she came back; I asked how much my order would be. It was starting to melt and I was becoming annoyed. She said ""I can't just add it up in my head. Hold on."" Okay; more waiting. When we finally paid; I said ""can I have spoons for my order?"" She gave me a smile and started counting out individual spoons; one at a time; like she was happy to make me wait. This ordeal took over 15 minutes while people were waiting in line behind me. I've been coming to this location since I was a child but with all of the other locations in the area; I'll be making a trip elsewhere as long as they employ rude people like this. [REVIEW_7] Loved this spot! We came here for a late bite after a 76ers game and sat at the bar. The brussel sprouts were bomb and my boyfriend loved his burger. Great service - they kept my champagne glass filled the whole night! [REVIEW_8] After a long hiatus from reviewing I have awaken from my 6 mouth yelp hibernation and my tummies a grumbles with an insatiable hunger for the cacophonous symphony of flavor that is Indian food. Like an all too familiar pattern; I go back to Mohammad Butt; my main man for marsala. But whats this?  There are whispers that he no longer cooks for ""Best Taste of Asia;"" that he is gone; never to return; some sort of falling out.  No. No; it can't be!  I need to score - one .. final .. hit..  Life ceases to have meaning; existential murmurings dog the mind. Who am I? Why am I here? What is Cheeze Wiz? Its done; over; a round falls into the chamber and just as I prepare to end it all and pull the trigger- steps in ZAIKA.  Zaika - meaning the art of taste -  stays to to its name. This is a place where the Paneer (cheese) is made fresh in house; resulting in a cheese that's silky in texture. Especially when in contrast to the prepackaged rubbery bone-white LEGO blocks most small Indo-Pak places purchase from Indian Grocers in attempts to reduce prep-times. While at Zaika such shortcuts are not taken;  the Chef takes the extra steps needed to ensure a dish comes together as a whole. For example; the Chicken Makhani uses Smokey Tandoori Chicken; which I have never seen done before but it certainly aids the chicken to cut though the rich buttery tomato sauce and elevates the dish as a whole. Even entrées like Dall Fray or  Palak Paneer  have so much flavor that they will leave you not missing animal protein in the least should you choose to go the vegetarian route.   Zaika 's appetizers; like the Veggie Samosa and Aloo Tikki; (spiced potato patties) are generally large; peppery and well spiced - the latter of which remind me of something my own mother would make. Though I must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop-up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers; unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment. These peppers are spicy; not deveined or even seeded. Further; I find the fish pakora to be far too fishy.   I've become rather taken by Zaikia. Even the simply things such as the naan are good there. Just right in elasticity; the bread does not have too much give and yet isn't too soft. It's nothing elaborate; just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor. The only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has. But hey; I use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix; so I don't mind at all.  The menu has nearly 120 different items; all numbered to order by; making take-out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem. Furthermore; it has short descriptions of each dish - something all ethnic places like this should have. Though some items like Lassie (a frothy yogurt drink) do not appear on the menu; that too is offered - both a salty and sweet mango verities.  The head chef speaks English quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders.  I have already noticed parties negotiating catering for Ramadan as I anxiously awaited my own order.  The bottom line here is this; Mohammad Butt has expanded on the menu he once created for ""Best taste of Asia;"" and taken an all HALAL meat approach.   Only good things can come of this; only good things.  P.S. ZAIKA is right behind Nifty Fifties on Grant Ave.; so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake.  However; I would suggest getting the Ras Malai if available. These riccotta cheese dumplings flouting in soaked in sweetened; thickened milk are delicately flavored with cardamom; a very some amount of rose water and then garnished with pistachios. They are ungodly good. [REVIEW_9] Best wings in Indy. Get the signature sauce. Both locations have great atmosphere with awesome wait staff. [REVIEW_10] Will never go to this dealership again.  Got a written price quote via email for a Honda Odyssey. Went to the dealership; but they did not have the color and model I wanted (in which case why quote a price; but lets just ignore that as agressive marketing.) We agreed that they would add a DVD player to a lesser model; and also agreed on the price - this time with a printed quote in my hand. Went back after a week to close the deal and pick up the van; but they wanted a higher price; in effect renegging on the deal.  I walked out.  Went to a different dealership - Burns Honda - where I got the model I wanted and at the promised price. [REVIEW_11] Best breakfast sandwich I've ever had!  The Mrs. says their chicken is waffles are top notch too [REVIEW_12] One star isn't even low enough for how I am feeling right now. Wings over broadway use to be my favorite wing stop in Tucson until recently when we ordered 16 boneless wings.   We were DISGUSTED to find what appears to be parts of a worm inside of our wings. Usually service is alright. But that night they also happened to have the lady who appeared to be a manager lecturer one of her cooks for 10 minutes while people piled up at the counter for the one waitress on staff room orders and ran food to tables.   Needless to say; I will not be returning. And I truly do wish many others see this review and do not return as well. I spent 30 some dollars on horrible service and disgusting food. [REVIEW_13] I'm almost thankful that there is usually a line for this place.  If there was not; I would eat here daily; and become obese.  I've only been here once; but my friend and I tried 4 different kinds of pancakes.  We had banana bread (probably our favorite; the famous sweet potato; raspberry; and chocolate chip.  All of them were awesome. We also felt the need to eat potatoes and bacon.. Because night shifters are ravenous when they get off work in the morning.  Just take everyones word for it and eat here and then take the rest of the day off to recuperate from your food coma. [REVIEW_14] My experience was negative; I feel they cheated me here. I went twice a few days apart to buy 1/4- decomposed granite. Both times I went I purchased a yard and used the same truck. I had different drivers loading each time. The first time l was loaded and left. My pickup bed was about half full. I didn't think anything of it because I wasn't sure how much a yard of dirt was. The second time I went back I started to drive away after the operator put one bucket of dirt in my bed. He waved me to stop and told me he had only put half a yard in and added another bucket. This time my truck bed was full and definitely much heavier. I have an old S10 so I knew their was a difference in how much dirt I got by how my truck was handling.  I figured the reason I didn't get the full amount the first time was I must have driven away too fast for the operator to tell me to wait. I went back; as I intended to buy 13 yards more and get it delivered. When I explained what happened; thinking they would say no problem let us give you another 1/2 yard I instead was told I was wrong. I was told I must have been loaded with a different loader; one was a half yard and the other a full yard loader (nope; same sort of loader both times); then they told me that my dirt must have been wet on one of my trips (nope; dry both times); And finally I was told that the difference was because I bought different colors on the two trips; brown 1/4- the first time and Apache red 1/4- the second; (huh? A yard is a volume measurement not a weight measurement). Needless to say I didn't buy additional product gravel from them. (They also were going to charge me a $50 delivery charge.. I live about 5 miles away). I ended up buying 15 tons of decomposed granite from Sonoran Landscape which is just around the corner. They sell by the ton and weigh their product on certified scales so you know your getting what you pay for. They also have no delivery charge for over 9 tons. Green Valley rock sucks; don't buy from them!! [REVIEW_15] Cashier was very rude fat Hispanic girl at the airport location. Very very rude. Half the menu wasn't even available. [REVIEW_16] I have been going to this nail salon for years off and on. I came here back when it was called Tropical Nails and Tom was the owner. Now its Grant Nails and has a different owner. When I started getting my nails done again I lucked out and found an experienced technician named Amy. I stuck with her because she did good nails. Then about 2 months ago Amy left. So I let the owner Angela do my nails. The first time was ok. Then the second time she did them the gel polish (which she talked me into getting instead of regular polish) started to chip within a day. I called and complained; she redid the polish and again within one or two days it was chipping. Now my nails look at mess. I don't trust her to correct the problem. Unfortunately; I'm going to have to find a new nail place. Very upsetting and disappointing. [REVIEW_17] I have been to The Blind Tiger on multiple occasions for everything from business meetings to pleasure like this morning. It has a great atmosphere inside and is in a convenient location. And after this mornings experience; along with multiple subpar visits; I had to write a review. The staff's attitude is always hit or miss on whether or not they are having a good day. I walked in this morning about 30 minutes after opening. It was quiet inside because it is an early Sunday morning. I said good morning to the girl who looked like she was mad at the world. Okay; we all have bad days and this wasn't the first time experiencing this there so I blew it off. I stated that I wanted my order to go and order two drinks. I asked about a pastry which was told it was a guava and cheese (one of my favorites) so I ordered one of those too. I sitting outside and walked back in after a few minutes to check on my order. I saw that the pastry was boxed up (which I appreciate the personal touch of their logo on the box) and then was told my first drink was ready. It wasn't in a to go cup so it had to be fixed. Instead of the barista handing it to me at the counter where I grabbed the pastry and was waiting; maybe three feet from the barista; she made me walk down to her to grab the cup instead of her walking to me. I walked back outside to wait on my second order; came back in a few minutes later to my next drink just being finished. I told the barista that the drink looked beautiful from the design she made on top and got zero response. And no have a good day; thank you; nothing. Instead the ladies were talking about what food they wanted to eat. Again; I was the only one who they were waiting on because it was a Sunday morning. I left and began drinking my coffee and it wasn't hot and my boyfriend's wasn't either; but it wasn't worth going back after all of that. And to top it all off; when I got home to eat the pastry; it didn't have any cheese in it and barely any guava and I threw part of it away. What blows my mind even more is that they hold training classes for those who want to learn more about coffee. They should focus more on making sure their staff is performing up to expectations as today they failed in almost every way possible. [REVIEW_18] Disclaimer: This review is based on the Sunday buffet.  The price is $35.99.  You get the buffet and unlimited margaritas; sangria red and white; Bloody Mary; and mimosa.  These are in the serve yourself dispensers and they are in no way WEAK!  These are the same if not better than if you got it at the bar to order.  The food on the buffet is good.  Not your average buffet effort everything had flavor.  Eggs; sausage; crab legs; omelets; carving stations; French toast; pancakes that is just naming some.  This place is definitely a hidden gem and they are looking to beef up business so give it a shot. [REVIEW_19] We were really hoping to find a very good; local Vietnamese restaurant ...unfortunately this is not it! After reading the glowing reviews of other diners we had high hopes...but after our mediocre meal I thought maybe we had stumbled into the wrong place. The decor was nonexistent; bathroom filthy; and our appetizer was served after our main courses. If the food was excellent I could overlook all that...but the food was very disappointing. We won't be back...and our search continues for a good Vietnamese meal. [REVIEW_20] Last time:  This is the second and last time my wife and I visit this place.  We were the ONLY table; yet it took the waitress at least 15 minutes to get our order.  From then our pizzas took about 45 minutes (they were both small).  While waiting for our pizza I had to move us to the bar are a.  I couldn't stand listening to one of the other waitresses bitching about the place non-stop while our waitress was sweeping.  Her bitching was amplified in that echo chamber.  And after all that waiting my pizza was barely warm.  This place has now earned a spot on my short list of PLACES TO AVOID.",8
23,"[REVIEW_1] I was sort of unsure how to rate this place. I had a similar experience to Sara P.  I joined in October. Got a GREAT workout. It was really enjoyable and definitely challenging. In December; emails about fraud; theft; employees leaving started coming.  My husband and I had purchased; but didn't get to use yet; 10 classes each for $85.  The new owners wouldn't recognize the 10 classes; but we can each have $85 credit. I was told we had till the end of Feb to covert the credit to classes but the owner said I may want to wait; as she offers specials in February.  I email this week about a deal they have for 5 classes for $47. I get an email back that I can't use the credits for special deals.  What??? I just want to use my credits; and walk away. It doesn't seem to me that this place is fixed at all. There are plenty of places in Philadelphia where I can work out and not have to worry about all this drama. The workout is a 4-5 star. The ethics is a 1. [REVIEW_2] Place is going downhill. They raised the prices but not on the menu.   Served cheese whiz instead of Swiss.  Had to get out money back. Staff was rude when questioned.  Just about threw our money back at us. [REVIEW_3] Absolutely delicious. Fresh and flavorful ingredients. Quality atmosphere. Reasonable service. Fantastic selection. Great for lunch or a light dinner. [REVIEW_4] My mother-in-law has been there for over an year; and their is one issue after another. My wife has had to go and complain because they miss giving her Parkinson Medication; on multiple occasion. Just this week my  mother-in-law did not let my wife to take her out to Christmas shop because Manor Care has not given her a bath in over a week. She also told us that one of the aid; lifted her out of her wheel chair by pull up on her neck. We have talked to the director several time who committed to resolve the issues and does for a while; then something else develops. The state has been involved; but problems still arise. We are now looking into relocating her near our home in Idaho. Do not put any love one in manor care; unless you are able to check on them weekly. [REVIEW_5] First time I went to Earl's new American kitchen I liked the food it was good wasn't great but it was a ok   service not so great sat at the bar did not really care for a bartender tried it again second time bartender was really rude I would never go back there  or Recommend it to anyone [REVIEW_6] DO NOT shop there! Driver decided to drive off with out fridge- after 4 hours on the phone resolution was a 10% coupon and delivery... In 4 days!! Worst experience ever! Unprofessional and rude! Would never shop there again. Beware!! [REVIEW_7] First let me start off by saying DO NOT go to this business for your special occasion the owner does not care about you! Boy if I could give this business less than one star I would ( I guess the single star can go to the overall look of the inside). Other than that let me tell you about my experience with this business. I booked my boyfriend and I for our first couples massage for his birthday today; Saturday; on Tuesday morning. The person I talked to on the phone seemed to be in a rush but seemed to have gotten all of my information even asking if I was okay with a male and female masseuse. When I went to spell out my name I got a quick ""okay okay"" mid sentence. No big deal. Today when my boyfriend and I got there twenty minutes early for a massage we saw a busy fully booked very busy business. We sat there for probably 5 to 10 minutes before being acknowledged. Still not a big deal they were busy and that's why we got there early for things like this. After the guy got our name he looked at the appointments list repeatedly trying to find our names or numbers he simply said we weren't on the books. There was nothing he could do they were fully booked for the day and then he proceeded to ask me who I spoke to on the phone did she sound Vietnamese because that was the owner she does that all the time to people. She takes there appointment and never writes it down! This was the most ridiculous thing that I have ever heard of. We asked when the owner would be in and he said she was there. Then we asked well won't she do something about this and he just flat out said no. The second most ridiculous thing that I have ever heard. We left at that point. Needless to say I was pissed at this point no massage for us. Birthday ruined. Can't comment on actual paid for services can only speak of owner and employees. [REVIEW_8] Cute interior/creative space. The location was a little off convention center Blvd hidden in a shopping center. I could see it almost being passed but you should definitely stop in! The food and service were excellent; we really enjoyed the menu! And the vibe was super chill. [REVIEW_9] --------DINNER REVIEW----------  I rarely write reviews; but this honestly was one of the worst group dining experiences I've ever had. It was objectively a horrible experience; even without comparing it to the hype it receives; and ruined what was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner celebration.   We had a group of 8 that had a reservation made well in advance. Short wait; but not too bad. Keep in mind; it seemed like a normal Friday night; but weren't super busy or at-capacity.  It was a birthday dinner; so I told the hostesses that it was her birthday; and asked if they could bring out something for her at the end of the meal; which was acknowledged. Pretty standard stuff; whether at a Applebee's or the French Laundry. We were sat at a booth right next to the Maitre D' stand; and next to all the wait staff's home base; so pretty much no excuse for not getting any attention.   After getting us waters; it took them a LONG time to even come by and acknowledge us. After ordering wine; it took them another good 15-20 minutes to even bring us our wine; and no one even checked in on us! (hint: if you're running a restaurant; wine is your profit center and doesn't take any work other than taking a bottle off a shelf and opening it. bring it out ASAP...).   After ordering food; it was more of the same...a long wait for food to start coming out and no one checking in on us AT ALL. We drank the bottles we ordered and had to get up and flag someone down to get another wine order. A couple of us even got up during the meal to remind them to bring out something for birthday girl at the end of the meal.   Once our meal was done and taken away; we were given dessert menus and the server disappeared for 10-15 minutes... AGAIN. After coming back; he asked what dessert we wanted; so we ordered some coffees... and waited... and waited. Eventually we got up and asked him what was going on and if they were going to bring anything out like we asked multiple times.   They finally brought out a couple of cookies with a candle...  In summary; the food was pretty hit or miss; pretty mediocre for this price point. Whipped feta; like other reviews have said; was amazing; and the Braised Lamb was really good. But the Sirloin was chewy and bland and the Grilled Caesar tasted like a soggy; luke-warm; wilted mess (two orders were left untouched by a group of 8). Atmosphere was nice and trendy. But the service; which is a huge reason to spend your hard-earned $ at a restaurant; was absolutely horrendous.   I really love going to cool; popular restaurants and having a great time; and I hate writing such a negative review; but I had to share my experience; especially for a restaurant that is getting an awful lot of (undeserved) hype. [REVIEW_10] This is my kind of place - they use fresh everything and the seasonings are expert.  The service on Friday nights is fantastic.    Over the years; the cooking has improved and is tastier than ever.  It's hard to get a seat; so plan on waiting 30 minutes on a busy night - that being said; it's not long until you are seated and promptly given water and they have real candles here.    I always order the coconut soup (I order it with the tofu ""not fried"") and also the yellow curry with tofu - also not fried.  It lends a more delicate flavor to the already rich curry.  It is to die for - tastes like dessert.  It is served with rice.  Last time I ordered the Pho - my goodness; the bowl is so huge and served with two sauces - hoisin and siracha.  Very good and filling - I would order it next time with more veggies (they are very good at helping you with special orders)  This is a BYOB and the prices can't be beat.  The menu keeps getting larger and I only wish I were closer to this place; as I would come here weekly for sure! [REVIEW_11] WAWA is the go-to-guy of convenience stores. Whether you're looking for a quick meal; or a late-night snack(presumably while intoxicated); the store contains everything imaginable. Had it not been for their lack of lottery tickets; SLURPEE products and booze; I would consider WAWA to eliminate all other convenience stores; and monopolize the entire industry. Try the stuffed jalapeño pretzel. [REVIEW_12] I love this place! The nail tech is so courteous and does exactly what you ask. They are a little understaffed on Monday and Tuesday with only one technician doing powdered nails and the other with manicures or pedicures; so be sure to make an appointment! [REVIEW_13] Like the whiskey selection; the bartenders are lively and knowledgeable. The food is great; especially the burgers and sandwiches. [REVIEW_14] The massage with the basic pedi is the best part!!! It was pretty long and the hot stone at the end was a nice touch [REVIEW_15] This is the best pizza in the area! A  lot of people rave about Jack's; but Joey's has a unique taste. Their Italian sausage pizza is to die for! And the bread on the hoagies and cheesesteaks is phenomenally soft and tasty! [REVIEW_16] Whenever we want the best sushi in town we have to come here. We almost always get the sashimi and sushi combination; along with a couple different orders of nigiri.   Always amazing and worth the high price. [REVIEW_17] One star for really nice service + no wait (came at an off hour); but this place was the worst meal I had in Nashville. The grits were a massive dissapointment - the cheese wasn't even melted into them; and the pancakes weren't bad; but also weren't better than Ihop...  We couldn't understand the hype and guessed that it maybe has to do with hungover college kids rolling in and appreciating greasy food? [REVIEW_18] Slowest service at night... Daytime people are fine. Actually saw a worker; older white lady; walking around without her shoes on.  Very gross. Hope the health department and owner sees this and looks at the time and date and takes care of business. [REVIEW_19] Visiting SB from the Midwest and after a long day in wine country; our host treated us to carry out Pizza Mizza.  All pies were tasty; but my favorite was the one with chicken; mushroom; and rosemary white sauce.  Not a combination I would have come up with; but they're the creative people.  Yum. [REVIEW_20] This tour was awesome! My friend scheduled this tour in advance for my group of 5 our first night staying in the French quarter. Out of all the things I was told to do in NOLA; going on a haunted tour was the top of our list! We met the tour guide on the corner of a busy area outside a small grocery store. The only thing I might say that was confusing was the other groups that were doing a haunted tour the same time we were and were meeting in the same vicinity. We approached the other group by accident and said we were there for the 5 in 1 tour; the man who for the other tour company told us we were in the wrong place and made very negative comments about our tour guide and the company we had signed up for. Honestly it just made HIS company look bad that he would say that to someone.   Anywho; the tour was awesome-not going to give any of it away because the stories are best told by the Bone Lady herself. She was so animated and knowledgeable and while other reviewers have said negative comments about the tour; they probably just weren't paying attention (which is hard to do on a Friday night in the French quarter)   At the very end of the tour our group approached the bone lady to tell her how much we enjoyed the tour; she told us about her cemetery tour which was taking place on Sunday. We signed up with her right then and there! SERIOUSLY go on both of these tours; you won't regret it!   One more comment about the negative reviews; you'll notice a couple people say it's boring: it's not! It's a 5 in 1 tour that lasts 2 hours; there's a TON of history to go over and if you're chatting or not paying attention you will miss all of the stories!",11
24,"[REVIEW_1] I have read some of the other reviews and should have read them before trying this place.  Eating should be enjoyable.  I have started eating at Jade Garden at Hillsborough and Habana.  Definitely worth the drive to get some quality Chinese food. [REVIEW_2] I'm all for a dive bar but this place takes it to another level. The walls are old wood panel; the whole place smells disgusting; the drinks are tiny...I don't feel any need to ever go there again. [REVIEW_3] The food is barely edible. Got goat biryani and goat curry. The Goat meat was tough and full of gristle. The biryani left a lot to be desired.  There are several places in Delaware that have far better tasting biryani.  Being a to go place service is non existant. [REVIEW_4] We got there 30 plus minutes before the show expecting to enjoy a drink or two and some food before the show...were told a server would be right over to help us...no one ever came...so no drinks or food...seats were comfortable but no service took a lot out of the experience. [REVIEW_5] Beware of smiling Joe! We bought living room furniture from him. We trusted him. He told us that once furniture was delivered it would be harder to return; however; he didn't say it couldn't be returned--just harder. When I called to tell Joe two of the furniture pieces weren't going to fit and we needed to exchange; he said ""oh; let me talk to customer service and call you back."" I let two days pass and called him back since he didn't return my call. The person that answered phone asked if they could give Joe a message; I said yes; that they could tell him I wanted him to call me back like he said he was going to do. Within 2 minutes my phone was ringing; but it wasn't Joe. I think she said her name was Madilyn; not sure. She said that she was just calling to tell me there are no returns or exchanges. I told her that Joe had said it was hard and the paperwork just says Ashley reserves the right to refuse returns but it doesn't say they won't. She proceeded to rudely and condescending ly say that she could read the paper to me. I told her thanks but I know how to read.   It's sad that some Ashley employees in Clearwater Florida are rude and intentionally mislead what would have been ongoing customers. Our home is new and we need more furniture. However; we will now look for a more reputable company to give our money to. Hope it was worth it smiling Joe and condescending customer service person [REVIEW_6] Called to make an appt and didn't make a reservation cause the person that answered the phone was zero help and acted like they didn't want to help me. [REVIEW_7] I chose to try this salon out because it was close to home and I needed my solar nails removed and I wanted gel instead. They clearly didn't know how to remove solar as they spent an hour scraping it off after the initial  soak. They proceed to do gel; but she coated my skin more than the nail and after several redos finally finished. A few days later; the gel is coming up. Never will return. [REVIEW_8] Great view and the decor and architecture is quite elegant.   I can only comment on the lunch buffet; but it was pretty horrible. It was very akin to cheap catering you might find at a party where the host paired it with a keg of Budweiser.  Service? hahahaha.. ohh.. that was funny. [REVIEW_9] I had high hopes for this place since the parking lot was full. I ordered fish and chips; and got peas and macaroni and cheese on the side. My companion ordered the knackwurst and saurerkraut with mashed potatoes on the side. The main courses were all right. The macaroni and cheese was inedible for me. The flavoring tasted very artificial. My companion's mashed potatoes tasted like paper. We have eaten at enough establishments like this to know we can get better quality food for more affordable prices. We will not be returning. [REVIEW_10] Went here to try out the two basketball courts I saw listed......waste of my time. Neither one is playable and both have been seriously neglected. All of the rims are very crooked and bent down significantly. The pavement hasn't been redone in years and has grass growing throughout it. Hopefully they put the time into redoing it because a decent outdoor court in this area would be great addition to the park. [REVIEW_11] So; so disappointed in this place. It used to be great when it first opened; but the past two times I've gone it's been terrible. The experience Villagio offers does not match up with the price of movie tickets; food; beverage; ect. If I'm paying $26 for two tickets; over $12 for food and beverage service then I expect to receive more than 1 star service AND for napkins; utensils; ect.. To be brought out with my meal. The staff looks miserable; no one seems to care about overall customer service. [REVIEW_12] I am giving this restuarant one star because we did not dine there. We attempted to though. We showed up on a Saturday night about 8:30 pm. The parking lot was full but we did not see a line or anything to look like there was a wait. When we walked inside the music downstairs was so loud it sounded like a Salsa club. There was no host to greet us. Finally a man came up to us and told us they were booked for the night and that there was ""going to be a long wait"". Uh okay... He did mention we were welcomed to sit at the end of the bar if we wanted to. Who wants to eat a nice dinner at the end of a bar?   We will not be back to try to eat here. [REVIEW_13] I will not return to this location. I contacted the manager in regards to a poorly made pizza I received; he replied to my online inquiry but never followed through on taking care of things. I even sent a photo to prove that the appearance of the pizza was not acceptable; and I never heard back from him. [REVIEW_14] What a GREAT experience... I love this place. I took a two hour photography lesson and it was awesome. Thank you Rick for teaching me to finally understand my camera!!! They do a great job I wish we would have found this place years ago! Please if you need help understanding your camera this is the place to go without ripping you off.  The studio is great and they can do amazing things with your photos; and I recommend that everyone who reads this to become a member it is well worth it! The  only bad thing I could say is; I can only rate shutter buddies 5 stars it deserves @ least 10! Great place with the great people who work there [REVIEW_15] I will never eat here again. I ate here a couple months ago and it was average (maybe three stars) but after this last experience they have been demoted to a one star in my eyes. We ordered the chicken saltimbocca ($23) and the chicken picante ($15) each with a side of linguine w/ the garlic butter sauce and each came with a side of escarole soup and side salad. We ordered this for pickup so they then told us that we had to bring them containers to put the soup in because they didn't have any. And I dint think this was just because they ran out bc my gf remembered this happening in the past.   So we picked it up after we took out money at the Wawa because they don't take cards. Um its 2011; everyone uses cards. Get with the times son. We finally got the food back to my place and when we opened it up we found out that they gave us marinara sauce instead of the garlic butter and I'd usually let it slide but I was really in the mood for it and I'm tired of not getting what i ordered. So I called them up and the lady that answered the phone gave me to the guy that took the order and I explained that we didn't get the right sauces and he said in a very rude tone ""well I didn't hear your wife or your girlfriend or whoever that was say that you wanted that sauce. Its an extra 2 dollars for that sauce. I can make it for you and you can come back up and it will be 4 bucks"". I was so caught off guard and didn't know what to say I just said ""no I wont be doing that"" and hung up. After I hung up all the great comebacks that I missed out on. I felt like George Castanza in the one episode where he thinks of a bunch of witty comments after the fact. Unfortunately I wont have another chance to hit him with my comebacks because I'll never go back.   Also the food tasted like tin foil. Sounds awesome I know.. [REVIEW_16] The only reason I mentioned the media or attorney was out of frustration after he would not provide the owner's contact info so I could appeal to her about keeping the area clean and cleaning or painting the columbarium.  That older area that is out of sight has been that way for years but we finally got tired of it and complained.  He never admitted it could be cleaned up.  As for the vase; I didn't demand just one for my Dad.  I stated he should replace the cheap plastic vases on ALL the niches as they were falling off and disintegrating.  There are not very many of them. I simply thought it would be the right thing to do.    If there was empathy; I did not hear it. [REVIEW_17] Terrible! Rude service; and very dirty. Floors had trash on them. The bathroom that I used had water (or some other substance) on the floor.  I was pregnant and taking the glucose tolerance test which takes a long time. I had to use the bathroom often. I was scolded for using the bathroom because the water was turned off which they apparently do during a urine drug test. I had no idea...and then I couldn't flush the toilet or wash my hands. I wasn't even offered to use another sink. Ridiculous! [REVIEW_18] Salad was good.  Pizza is not good!  Boring; tasteless and just unsatisfying.  Very disappointed.  Also on a chilly night it is a cold interior.  This was my third try there.  Won't go back [REVIEW_19] I don't know this for sure; but my first impression of this place is that it is run by unscrupulous people. Come along with me; as I journey back in time -- all the way back to Wednesday...  I step foot in this 7 Eleven; and the first thing I think is: this is one of the nicest looking 7 Elevens I've ever seen. It is very clean; bright; and spacious. Very nice looking selection of prepared meals. There were many that actually looked like they'd be quite good. But I wasn't hungry this day. No. All I needed were a few items.   First; some good old TP. And let me be perfectly clear (as clear as Barack Obama): I DON'T buy the cheapest toilet paper because I'm cheap. I buy it because I like the way the cheap stuff feels. The more like sandpaper; the better. I like to feel like its working. I don't need to or even want to feel like an angel is up there. Or some perverted freak named Scott.   In any case; I got myself 4 rolls. And then I just needed one more thing - some plastic cups for a little party I'm having this weekend.   I go ahead and drop my stash on the counter; begin to extract several singles from my wallet; when the cashier looks at me and says; ""24.99.""  I respond; ""That's not right.""  He points at a price tag on the plastic cups which reads 19.99. I begin laughing. I tell him the price is clearly wrong. He tells me he's got to talk to his manager. Meanwhile; I tell the folks behind me waiting in line that I'm just going to go run and get different plastic cups to hurry the process along. Before he got back from doing his price check; I already had another cashier ringing up my two sleeves of cups for 1.99 each. That's more like it.  At around that same moment; the first cashier comes back from his consultation with his manager. He tells me that the price was; in fact; incorrect. And that the price is actually 14.99.  THAT'S the unscrupulous part.  CLEARLY; THAT price is also far too high. His manager did no actual price check at all. He simply told the cashier to pretend that the real price was actually 5 dollars less; thinking that I'd be stupid enough to accept this. Why; because I'm white; and you're a racially superior Indian? You think white people are stupid don't you? We'll just believe what you tell us; and fork over our money. [REVIEW_20] Spider; spider everywhere! Best for the Halloween day ;-) We had to literally kill a few spiders inside the washroom and one nearby the bed. Worst hotel I ever lived... Even non-smoker room smell smokey; tiles and fixtures were broken (check the posted pics); and the water was dripping all night. The whole corridor felt damp and smell nasty :-0 We were forced to stay here; as there wasn't anything else nearby; and we were unfamiliar of the city; and it was 9:00 at night to search another after 8 hours of driving :-(",1
25,"[REVIEW_1] Very unhappy with the treatment we received today. After eating a Sushi Rose since it opened up; and their parent restaurant Asian Wok next door; we have never had a sushi chief be so rude and inhospitable. Flower was the acting manager today. She almost permanently lost our business had it not been for the kind service of the waitress. [REVIEW_2] Emmanuelle is beautiful; from the walls; to the chandelier; to the drinks; to the bar set up; to the bathrooms. All of it.  I don't often write reviews this short; but that's all you need to know. There is nothing bad that can possibly be said. I wish this place was closer to where I live.   Just; love. [REVIEW_3] The food is disgusting. We watched the cook microwave all the food. Never go here. I didn't even eat the food [REVIEW_4] I got some friends a room at the JW for the night as a gift the night of their wedding.  The only request I made of the front desk was that the bride and groom would not have to worry about any expenses.  2 of us separately went down and gave credit cards to the front desk to make sure everything was taken care of.  I got a phone call at 11:30 that night from the bride and groom saying that they were being asked to pay for parking.  Huge fail JW.  When I asked to talk to the manager; all he did was make excuses.  No apologies; no reassurance that they would be well taken care of for the rest of their stay.  If you want a seamless stay; this is not the place.  Huge disappointment. [REVIEW_5] For authentic; fresh and flavorful Mexican food; you have to go to Las Cazuelas. The enchiladas; Mole; and Mole Enchiladas are fantastic. The Horchata and Mexican Coffee are excellent drinks. It gets major points for being BYOB. The meats are so tender and the rice is perfectly cooked. The main reason for the perfect five stars is what topped the whole experience for me: the dessert. THE BEST DESSERT I'VE EVER EATEN. EVER. You MUST order the Cheesecake Bunuelos!!! It will blow your mind. I will forever be returning to Las Cazuelas. [REVIEW_6] 2 thumbs down. I Went there for my 1st ever  manicure. Another customer came in 20 minutes after I did; no appoint. either. She was there for gel manicure. 5 minutes later the girl sits us both down; then proceeds to start working on getting her set up with gel manicure. She was on her way back to me; and a lady comes in for an unscheduled eyebrow wax. She tells me it's going to be a few more minutes so she could wax her. So she was going to help 2 unscheduled women who came in after me. That's bad business. So I got up and left. They clearly don't need my business. [REVIEW_7] Not just for feet. All I can say is....Wow! Worth the extra $$ for an hour full body massage. Simon has the most talented hands to coax your muscles to relax; taking the kinks out with skill. The atmosphere is very desirable and comfortable. You don't realized the importance of human touch until you have a professional work their magic. They provide walk-in service; but I recommend scheduling an appointment for a massage; especially during the early evening hours. My daughter and I had a foot massage there and this too was fantastic! First place whose prices are affordable and well worth indulging in. I highly recommend this little slice of heaven. [REVIEW_8] First off we got a jacuzzi suit (large jacuzzi seats 3) on a holiday weekend; with breakfast (not continental) the day before for 119; customer service was amazing. Right across the street from every shopping center you could want.  Rooms were clean and updated; they are very accommodating about late check out; very hospitable.  sure you can spend 250 to stay on the strip and have a smoke filled/Packed  hotel; but if you don't mind being a few miles out; this place is perfect;  cheap cab ride to the strip. Only take sparks cab; we took a few; not only are they 33% cheaper (on average) but they are far more personable and faster upon arrival. [REVIEW_9] Terrible place with an even worse owner!!! As a former veteran I was deeply offended when my wife and I over heard the owner saying some horrible things about veterans. It took every ounce of energy for me not to lose my temper!! But we left instead to go across the street to much better bar in Bruno's. To sum it all up; he does not appreciate veterans in his bar; so we are happy to help him out with that!! What a piece of work!!! [REVIEW_10] So so in love with this place & it is gorgeous. A very spacious & modern design & most of all CLEAN!!!! Love Will; Amanda & Sal! I have made several purchases to include some mods and atty's and being a newbie I have issues from time to time with the devices. Not because the devices aren't working but I may take something apart and can't figure out how to put it back together (newbie ish) lol They always help me and get me back to vaping!!! They have a wide variety of juices; mods; atty's and i'm always in there tasting something. You've got to try it! You will not be sorry! In love with this spot! [REVIEW_11] This place is something out of a sci-fi movie. I went in with a broken iPhone 5s screen that I needed to get replaced and I swear; when I turned around to look at phone cases; this guy must have popped out 4 more arms and used telekinetic powers to disassemble and reassemble the phone with the new iPhone screen. By the time I got done looking at phone cases on the wall (approximately 63 seconds) I turned to walk back to the counter to watch him repair my phone; but he already turned back to his normal human form with two arms and all the phone parts he had flying around with his telekinetic powers have been put away already as he was walking back to the counter to hand me the phone back. If you need a phone fixed; and fixed fast; I highly recommend going here; but I wouldn't recommend breaking your phone on purpose to try and catch a picture of the experience; by the time you get your camera out; the phone will be fixed already and he will be asking you if you want to pay by cash or credit. [REVIEW_12] I took my car to have the left headlight replaced; in Oct 2015. the price was reasonable. I had to take my car again in Dec 2015; because the headlight wasn't installed correctly(facing downward) it was fixed (no charge). And then again back to Sears auto Jan 27th because my headlight had gone out! At this point my blood is boiling! Because of employee negligence! Couldn't get it right the 1st time! Although I will say I wasn't charged; not that I would have paid for a headlight that I had already paid for 3 months ago! My headlight on the drivers side was replaced 2 yrs ago and as of today has not been replaced! Smdh.  I will NEVER TAKE MY CAR HERE AGAIN! Stay away!! Small details were overlooked. Needless to say; I didn't get good customer service and it's a good distance from my home; but close to my work. [REVIEW_13] What a great addition to the Funk Zone!  Grab a bite; grab some tastings; life is good. Right next door to the Santa Barbara Wine Collective; in fact it actually shares the same tables.  We had a fabulous savory croissant. [REVIEW_14] I can't say enough about the shop - clean; friendly and professional.  Stacey has done my eyebrows & eyeliner plus a few tattoos on me.  She is friendly; flexible and comes through with some great designs off my ideas.  Jamie is great too - her work is amazing. [REVIEW_15] I typically love KFC but my opinion is changing based on increasing cost and poor service.  Was interested in trying their new Nashville flavor but was advised that it is only offered in strips; as a 2 piece with one side or a bucket. I wanted it in a 3 piece with two sides and was advised that that was not possible. I guess I won't be able to try it. [REVIEW_16] Do not eat here! I ordered general tso tofu and asked for it to be extra crispy with light sauce. Not only did it come out FULL of sauce; but they refused to replace it and only offered to drain the extra sauce. Needless to say; it was bland and soggy. Never again. [REVIEW_17] Where to start. The coleslaw was amazing and fresh good fresh crunch. Fries seasoned just right; tartar sauce and the FISH the  fresh; clean; battered perfect and meaty. [REVIEW_18] Exceptional entrees; exceptional service.....and many very healthful options. One of our favorite local venues. Recommended without reservation. [REVIEW_19] I've been a Bargain Thrift fan since the age of 14 and I've never left empty-handed. Top-notch vintage and less expensive than the thrift shops in Center City of course. Through all of their transitions; from the one location to the next (both next door to each other) their selections have never faltered. I've always enjoyed the volunteer LaSalle students who are young and fresh and share a passion for second hand items although they can be competition on those hard to find ""hip"" items you may have your eye on (I think they are volunteers; not sure). Always a decent tag sale going on; in which they offer 1/2 off on a certain items having that same color tag. No doubt the $1 store further down is a true gem but I tend to find more at the regular priced location. Another point worth mentioning is that the plus sized crowd is sure to find handfuls of decent wares as well which is something I've heard friends criticize other thrift stores for falling short on. [REVIEW_20] Service was so poor we didn't even get to the food. New Years Day 2017 around 7:30 and we get seated. It's 8:15 now and we still don't have water and multiple waiters have introduced themselves to us saying they're going to be our server for the evening. After wasting 45 mins and repeated attempts to get water for the largest party in the small restaurant we walked out and went across the street to Dat Dog and were blown away by hot dogs. Thanks Dat Dogs!",11
26,"[REVIEW_1] I am not sure they deserve one star..but they do not deserve two. Went this afternoon shortly after lunchtime. Walked in and was seated with my girl near the buffet. We discussed eating from it...but decided against it. I haven't been to a CM since the one left the Foothills mall many years ago....I never had any issue with anything at that location. The one on Campbell was not good. Server was polite; but when she came and gave us silverware...it was as if she was playing tiddlywinks...I was a bit perplexed when my three pieces were laid down knife....spoon over knife at a 45 degree angle; then the fork over top the same way...about 6 inches from my napkin. I hadn't thought about it until now...but I feel she was trying in code to tell me not to eat there. Yeah....that has to be it. I looked at the fork...and it looked as if it was taken from the table behind us....as they were using it....it was replaced with a clean one....I am hoping it was anyways...at least there was nothing on it that I could see...and that is 90% of the battle. On to the food. I ordered a chorizo burro. $9.00. This was the driest chorizo I have ever eaten....as my girth with attest.....I have had much chorizo in my life. About three hours after.....I feel yucky. Anyways.....I will not be returning here. [REVIEW_2] If I could give Zero stars I would. We are return customers to this restaurant and now we will never return. We will go out of our way to go to the one in mid-city. We ordered the new sandwich ""The BET"" and paid an extra $2.00 for extra cheese. We received this sandwich with close to ZERO cheese. You would think for a ""cheese"" themed restaurant all of their sandwiches would be gooey with cheese. WRONG. The cheese on the sandwich didn't even cover 1/2 of the 1/2 of one side of the piece of bread. We mentioned it to Ebony at the register that we paid for extra cheese and showed her the sandwich. She brought it to the kitchen and shortly returned to us with our sandwich in hand and said ""my kitchen supervisor said there is cheese on this sandwich and he can't help us"" we asked if we can just add more cheese and she said ""if we want more cheese we will have to pay for it"" (which we already did) ""and he refuses to remake it"" terrible kitchen staff and HORRIBLE at handling service. [REVIEW_3] Two days here at the Eldorado with a group of 25 people. We have experienced the worse customer service . We just finished brunch and we're constantly badgered by our waitress about the number of people in our group. We were taking up too much space. She was a nice as a rattlesnake.  At 17 dollars per person I would think more is better. Food was ok but you will definitely not be welcomed or appreciated.   Yesterday same warm fuzzy feeling at the coffee shop when we spent over 350 dollars and we're treated like castaways.  TAKE YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE. .. NO HOSPITALITY AT ELDORADO [REVIEW_4] A few weeks ago; I over heard one of the management tell an employee in front of customers that he doesn't like white people. Walked out before even being seated. Not going to give them my money if that is their attitude. Obviously I am unwelcome. [REVIEW_5] This restaurant is seriously lacking in customer service!  We have dined many times at Dish.  We like the food.  We made a reservation two weeks ahead for 3 people.  When we arrived we were seated at the smallest table in the restaurant which barely fits two people.  The table next to us had an extra person added at the end; his back was literally a couple of inches from our table.  We asked for a table that would accomdate three people and not involve eating with someone's large back at our very tiny table.  We were rudely informed that it was a take or leave it situation.  It was very frustrating since we booked this as a special night out weeks earlier.  Unfortunately; we are writing this restraurant off our list. [REVIEW_6] Food wasn't great; way overpriced; waitress complained about a 10% tip.  The tomato soup tasted like pasta sauce ($13) both in texture and flavor.  The chicken was burnt on our quinoa and kale salad. ($20)  Skip the pulled pork sandwich; it has a weird flavor... possibly from the onion roll. [REVIEW_7] Ridiculous prices for small portions/little meat/mostly rice. [REVIEW_8] We had already spend a long while walking around through the parade and wanted to kill time before we got oysters. We were waiting for the line to die down at two other places but came across Creole House on the way to French quarter. The line was short and it was only a 20 minute wait. I am an oyster fiend. Living in NYC I got oysters every other night enjoying 2-3 dozens by myself. Thinking the oysters would be delicious ; I ordered 2 dozens and so did my sister. We also shared a cup of gumbo. My sisters friend had a shrimp po boy with fries. After half a dozen oysters I started to feel nauseous. I didn't want to waste any oysters so I suffered though the first dozen. My sister has a strong stomach and finish 1.5 dozen. I couldn't eat anymore. The gumbo was terrible. It had no flavor; it was so tiny for 7 dollars(we had way better gumbo at another place the day after for way less). We had a taste of the po boy as well. It was just ok. My sisters friend didn't finish it either. The fries came fresh out the freezer I'm sure. Dry and scrawny little things. Should've just gone to French quarter and ate at one of the other places. Probably would've been better since the lines were longer. Would've been worth the wait. What a waste of money. And stomach space. [REVIEW_9] I've been a customer for 6 years with no issues. I moved and had service installed at my new address. Apparently this is the quality of work you can expect from their technicians. As of right now I'm still waiting for a return call to find out how they plan on rectifying the issue.  (Photo posted) [REVIEW_10] We shop at acme pretty frequently. Today; we accidentally left a bag with a good amount of food in it at the self check out (pasta salad; cheese; etc). We noticed the moment we got home and immediately returned to the store. I also tried calling customer service twice to let them know and it just rang; and rang; and rang with no answer.   Well; when we got back - they were already reshelving our items! My husband had to go around the store and track everything down.   Are you freaking kidding me? You're telling me that they don't even wait for people to return before putting PURCHASED items back to sell AGAIN? There's seriously not a location where they put these items to give the buyers a chance to return?!   It was honestly a span of 20 minutes. That's ridiculous. [REVIEW_11] If I could give this establishment less than one star; I would. Over two hours for an appetizer at the bar 2 1/2 hours for 4 out of 6 people to get the food they ordered for lunch. Brutal - oh; and the bathroom was disgusting. I appreciate if your employees don't show up so half of the menu is off the table immediately but tell your customers if you can't deliver any food - and the owner did nothing to make it right in the end - other than to give a half-assed apology - not impressed [REVIEW_12] This bus is so overpriced at $55.  The staff is completely rude.  I took it from LAX to Santa Barbara today and it was 30 minutes late leaving because they couldn't track who was on the bus.  They had to do a roll call after checking people in. Then they pulled over after driving or of the way to let the manager off.  The driver was extremely rude when asked why it was leaving so late.  Someone needs to come in an offer the same bus service at a lower price with nice customer service. [REVIEW_13] We booked a big party there and requested one particular chef way in advance. When we arrived; they would not even seat our first guests even though the place was empty. Then they finally seated everyone; and we got the worst waiter one can find. He did not get our orders; did not refill glasses; when I asked to replace my fork because there was old food stuck to it; he did not bring me another one. After waiting for our hibachi chef for an hour; I finally went to talk to the manager about this. He was the rudest; most unprofessional person I've ever met! He yelled at me; and told me he did not care if the 12 of us walked out of there; and interrupted me every other word. Seriously; I could not be more appalled at his behavior; and did not know that ""customer service"" like this existed in America. Do not profit this guy by going to this place unless you like being treated like garbage for a very mediocre food and very high prices. [REVIEW_14] Friendly service but the food isn't worth eating. I tried to sample everything to try and find something to at least fill me up for a meal; everything is over cooked to the point where it's hard or rubbery. Ended up just getting a box of cereal. 11.99 each person; would have been better off eating at the sit down spot in silver legacy [REVIEW_15] Horrible. Waited over 2 hours for our order. Called the store 3 times- kept being told it was on its way. Pizza was under done and terrible. the manager said he would refund my order. Never gave a refund. I will be going in person tomorrow for a refund. [REVIEW_16] Oh my goodness if you ever want to start on a health ""trip"" this is the place to start. They have so many different vitamins (hence the name); healthy dietary supplements; beauty products and homeopathic items as well. The staff was super helpful in assisting me find some of the items i needed to make my very own moisturizer. They helped me locate the items they had and provided suggestions for items they did not have. They also have a rewards program for frequent shoppers - LOVE THAT! And they accept digital coupons- LOVE THAT TOO! [REVIEW_17] Ribeye was cold; fries tasted burnt; service was slow; Environment is bad. Seriously I would not be back. There was also even people arguing. This is the worst restaurant I ever been 2. They even ran out of peanuts!!!! [REVIEW_18] The worst wawa I've ever been to. Don't recommend ordering food inside: their employees are just standing and talking until you actually get something else; pay; walk around for a little; check if it's done yet and finally give them a look. That's when they go ""oh! There's food to make!"" Making latte in the morning takes them over 5 minutes; they're watching videos on their phones; chatting and slowly walking towards their stations. I hate the fact that it's the only place where I can get coffee on my way to work. I am the manager at the local pizza chain and my employees would never disrespect customers like that: if food has to be made they make it instead of talking! If the manager is reading this right now please take care of the situation; look at the cameras and you will see. The whole point of getting food and coffee at wawa in the morning it's because it's FASTER. But that's not what your employees think. [REVIEW_19] HUGE disappointment!  I am from Seattle and came down to Santa Barbara for New Year's Eve.  My girlfriends and I wanted to have a nice meal to bring in 2010. I thought I did my research--read reviews; got a recommendation from a local; and thought the online menu looked good.  When I called to make a reservation I had a lovely conversation with the owner--another confirmation that I had made the right choice.  Well; I couldn't have been more wrong.  My girlfriends and I got dressed up; made our way to the restaurant; and the second we walked in; I knew it was a mistake.  It was too cold to sit outside (which was beautiful); and so we went into the brightly lit indoor part of the restaurant; surveyed the scene and realized that we were the youngest people there by at least 40 years (and we are in our 30s).  The ""Latin jazz"" band was little more than forgettable background music; which did absolutely nothing to help the vibe.  There was no vibe.  The restaurant lacked energy; the wait staff were professional; but not personable; and the food was incredibly disappointing.  We knew we would be paying a lot (total 100.00 each) for a price fixe New Year's Eve dinner--and I have no problem spending that if the food is amazing; and the experience is unforgettable. As soon as we sat down we started to be served; the wait staff; highly attentive; perhaps because all of the food was already prepared in the back; not many people were there; and they wished they didn't have to work on New Year's Eve.  It was too much.  We got our drinks (mediocre mojitos) and immediately were served our appetizers; which made it hard to enjoy our drinks.  We could not languish over any of our dishes; but perhaps this was better; because the food was absolutely terrible.  I can only speak to what I ordered--it was the New Year's Eve price fixe; and apparently there was a guest chef that night; but I couldn't eat the majority of it.  The empanadas were OK; the soup was fine; I had a salad that had some kind of tangy dressing that I couldn't bear to put in my mouth.  The main dish I ordered was fish and it was served in tin foil.  I understand if it was cooked this way; but to serve it on a plate; with sides on the outside of the tin foil; made no sense to me.  In the end; it didn't even matter because the fish had absolutely no taste.  We ended up leaving before the clock struck 12:00--none on us wanted to start 2010 in a place that was bland; vibe-less; and forgettable.  I understand that this night may have been different from other nights; but it literally left a bad taste in my mouth and I will not return there nor recommend it to others. [REVIEW_20] Bait and switch! Buyer beware - falsely advertised price!  Went with a friend to check out a used Honda odyssey with an Internet advertised price ($24;999). Friend called the day before to confirm that the car was there and the price before we drove over an hour to get there. We checked out the car it was very nice and we were ready to buy when he dropped the real price on us of $34;600 - a HUGE difference! We could get a new car for that price!  The salesman said sorry that must be a typo but was unapologetic or willing to negotiate. Of course he was willing to show us something else. Stay away from these low sales tactics and spend your money somewhere else!",1
27,"[REVIEW_1] Worst place ever.  I ordered delivery to my hotel; they only delivered half the order; here is what followed:  ~8PM:  Drive tells me they have the rest of the order on the way with another driver ~9PM:  I call to follow up and am told it just left and should be there shortly ~10PM:  Call back and am told that they can't get in touch with the driver and she has her phone off ~10:30:  I call back and they still can't get in touch with the driver.  I tell them my kids are sleeping and I don't want them knocking at the door awakening them. ~11PM:  Call back and tell them this is ridiculous and to credit my account.  Very angry manger tells me that when I last called I cancelled the rest of the order (I did not).  I tell him that he can credit my card or I will contest the entire amount with my charge company.  He then tells me the food was left at the front desk and they tried to call my cell and room (they did not) ~11:15:  The front desk says they never dropped off the food and they pull this stuff often.  I call back and tell them that (and I was in the lobby most of the time since I didn't want my kids awakened).  He puts the driver on and she says she was just there and the front desk is lying.  I ask if she minds if I put her on speaker so she can call the hotel manager a liar since I believe the hotel.  She hands the phone to the manager.  He threatens me then hangs up.  I immediately call back and tell him the entire amount will be contested and he says he will credit my charge card.  5 days later; no credit.  They never intended to deliver the food and figured they would just outlast me.   Ordering from them is as stupid a decision as one can make. [REVIEW_2] We had the charbroiled oysters and they were delicious!  This was just the thing we needed to get our quick oyster fix... The sashimi was fresh and the lychee martini was the perfect pair for it!  Definitely and highly suggest this place [REVIEW_3] LOVE THIS SPOT!  It's in the French Market so don't expect something super fancy; but man do they hustle.  We got the shrimp and crawfish; boiled up perfectly.  The oysters take forever to come but that's because they are shucking them just as fast as they can and the lines are long! [REVIEW_4] Horrible service!  There for an hour and a half and never got food. Six tables seated after us got fed and left. Our server said he didn't know what happened. When I asked to speak to the manager I was told he was cooking in the kitchen. We finally walked out. [REVIEW_5] Jen provided all the flowers for my wife and I's wedding on Oct 7th 2016 at the Santa Barbara Courthouse; as well as the flower arrangements at our reception.  What we liked about Jen was that she was able to suggest certain floral and color arrangements simply by looking at my wife's dress and the bridesmaids' dresses beforehand. While we were a little nervous about whether or not she could pull it off; on the day of the wedding they matched what we were wearing perfectly!  Besides her attention to detail; she was very helpful on the day of the wedding when she pinned all the boutonnieres and corsages herself. We were worried that we'd mess it up; but she was able to position and pin them perfectly on us! Not to mention when we decided at the last minute to create matching flower crowns for the bridesmaids; she said no problem and didn't even charge us extra for the short notice!  I have no problem recommending Jen at the Twisted Twig for your wedding big or small; because her flowers made our wedding day unforgettably beautiful and special! [REVIEW_6] If you're a Latino; you're best staying away from this place. The lady that cut my hair was rude and very unprofessional. [REVIEW_7] By far the best brunch in Tucson. One of the rare places that serves a Bloody Mary with a beer back.  Service is consistently great. Expect a wait Friday-Sunday. Order the Benedict and the Madras mimosa. [REVIEW_8] This was so disappointing. I love Chick fil A. My son even works at the Avon location; which is fabulous. This is not the same. I tried to order my usual; that I get several times a week in Avon; and they received to accommodate. I only wanted the bread from the mini rolls. Go to Avon; very close and such a wonderful place to eat. [REVIEW_9] Love this location! The staff is so friendly and helpful; one staff member even helped me search for a lost baby shoe my ten month old had kicked off his foot! A+++ customer service. Prices are reasonable. This is a huge location! Drop the kids off and set aside 2-3 hours to explore this Mecca of current style clothing; vintage gems; records galore; housewares; great toys;etc. [REVIEW_10] Me and my friend paid to get our open water certification. Dennis Koslin was the instructor and was the most disrespectful ""teacher"" I have ever worked with in my life. I put quotes around the word teacher due to the fact that this was not a learning environment. If you asked any question during the class he would not answer it and would attempt to make a joke out of you as a person (unrelated to the question you asked). If you're looking for a fun learning experience where you feel fine to ask questions; this is not the place for you. If you are looking to be respected on a basic human level; this is not the place for you. If you want to be treated like an animal and for him to speak down to you; this is the place for you.  His father (the guy who runs the actual shop) was very kind and informative. [REVIEW_11] I have tried nearly every Hilton chain hotel in the Nashville downtown area and am running out of options.  I travel extensively; spending at least 200 nights per year in hotels; with most of those being the Hilton chain.  I've come to expect a certain level of service.  The Garden Inn at Vanderbilt consistently fails to live up to even minimum expectations as have other Hilton chain hotels in the downtown area (Homewood and Doubletree).  Inept and often condescending front desk staff; awful wireless; bland surroundings and generally bad service.  My team and I will be trying a new hotel brand! [REVIEW_12] We wanted to pick up some Zima and a male employee was very nice and said they were sold out and Zima is sold out everywhere in town. So he helped us pick out something he said will be similar but turns out grocery stores and Walmart have Zima. Lies. Oh; and P.S. Mr. Man; Truly Lime and Midori tastes nothing like Zima and Midori so thanks for that too. [REVIEW_13] Great spot for a birthday dinner! Try to get a table near the window. Sunset in August is typically around 8pm and the view is amazing. We ordered the lobster Mac and cheese; the duo beef entrée; and salmon. Delicious! For dessert we got the cheesecake which was very unique and not like anything else I have ever seen before. The chef also sent out delicious chocolates and praline treats! I lived it here and I can't wait to come back. Great service too; Antoine knew the menu very well and was highly professional. [REVIEW_14] Rude staff that stands around and does nothing besides stand in a circle and talk to each other. Doesn't bother to greet you when you walk in the door. Facility is old and not well cared for. [REVIEW_15] Best Indian food I have had in Tucson! Veggie samosas were delicious and the curry is to die for. This is definitely a hidden gem! [REVIEW_16] I took my expensive Christian Louboutins here to be dyed since I had heard that this place was one of the best in the city. Boy; what an overstatement. I wanted my studded gray CLs dyed black. I SPECIFICALLY told them to please; please; please be careful not to get any dye on the red soles because that is what makes a Louboutin a Louboutin. I also asked if they could dye it without covering the studs. They told me YES. They would tape off everything that wasn't going to be dyed and it would turn out perfect. I came back a week later; like they told me. Only 1 shoe was half done. So they told me another week.  I came in to pick them up today to find the worst dye job I have ever seen in my life. There was black dye all over the studs; all over the inside and the toe box; and (worst of all) all over the red soles. Besides the damage; all of the gray had not even been dyed. There were random un-dyed patches everywhere. I told them that this was not the kind of work I was promised. Then they changed their story and said that it would have been impossible to tape off the studs. They said I should not have even tried to get them dyed. When I questioned why there is dye on the inside and why the red soles are covered in black dye splotches; they said ""I don't know"". They told me they could TRY to remove the dye but that the red might come off; too. I told them this is completely unacceptable. And then they gave me an attitude. They said ""Look; we already told you we could remove the dye. I don't understand why you keep standing here talking.""  If the job could not be done; they should have told me ahead of time. I understand it was a tedious job; what with all the studs; but there is no excuse for getting dye all over the inside and soles. He said the dye would come off as I walked. ....YOU DON'T WALK ON THE ARCHES OF THE HEELS. I asked for my money back and they told me they dyed my shoes like I asked; so what more do I want. I just took my shoes and left. They must be crazy to think I would leave my shoes there for them to ""fix"".  I instead took them to Superior Shoe Repair near 15th and Walnut. I have taken shoes there before; so I should've went there to begin with because I know they are used to dealing with designer shoes. They said they could fix it; so I will be reviewing them when I pick them up this week. [REVIEW_17] OK; so we never actually got our food... Or our menus for that matter; which was very disappointing. Staff was rude and the dining room looked like a dive.  I heard such good things about this place and since we were checking out a band next door last night; we thought we'd go in and try this local soul food restaurant people have been raving about.  I went in with a small group of four. We stood by the door waiting to be seated for a good 5 minutes. But no staff was in sight. So we thought maybe this is one of those establishments where you seat yourself... So we did.  We sat close to the front and waited. Finally; a waiter came into the room. He looked right at us and kept walking - OK; guess we're not at his station. We waited again. Another waiter came in; she acknowledged us; but never came over. A third waiter came in - we must have been seated for 15 minutes at this point and still no service has come to the table -- not even to give us a ""I'll be right back"" explanation - he apparently wasn't our waiter either.  At this time another couple walked in - it looked like they were deciding whether they liked the place (it has a ""dive restaurant"" feel to it). One waiter sees the couple and points to a table for them to sit at. The couple still talking amongst themselves did not see the waiter signaling (why didn't he just walk up to them? Makes no sense). The waiter says; very loudly and rudely with an annoyed tone and expression; ""heeelllloooo!"" When they heard that; they left... And so did we because still; nobody had came to our table and we didn't want to miss our band because of some sub-par waiters who were struggling to handle a half empty dining room.   Too bad. Heard the food was good.  We ended up going to a place down the block( it was right next to d.b.a.)  the food was awesome; staff friendly; they had live music and we only ended up  spending about $150 for 4. [REVIEW_18] The Shop is an amazing space! Their attention to detail and services are unbelievable. Plenty of places to have private meetings as well as post up and get work done. [REVIEW_19] Unbelievable! Some sports bar; $5 cover charge; got wanded for guns and they didn't have any sports on. They had a video looping of Mexican music. Maybe I went at the wrong time or it has vastly changed.  Bartenders were cute and friendly [REVIEW_20] Not just for feet. All I can say is....Wow! Worth the extra $$ for an hour full body massage. Simon has the most talented hands to coax your muscles to relax; taking the kinks out with skill. The atmosphere is very desirable and comfortable. You don't realized the importance of human touch until you have a professional work their magic. They provide walk-in service; but I recommend scheduling an appointment for a massage; especially during the early evening hours. My daughter and I had a foot massage there and this too was fantastic! First place whose prices are affordable and well worth indulging in. I highly recommend this little slice of heaven.",9
28,"[REVIEW_1] Great place if you are a carnivore...and if you're not try the sides!  I've had everything off of this menu and it's all delicious.  Pulled pork; BBQ chicken sandwich..rack of ribs; corn salad; mac and cheese; baked beans...just writing this is making me hungry.  It's so awesome to have something this good and this authentic in the hood.  NOT expensive either.  Informal but cozy. [REVIEW_2] My experience at Tennessee Brew Works was noteworthy! I tried the beer flight so that I could sample all the yummy brews they have to offer. I really enjoyed them all but my favorite was their Witt! We sat outside on their patio on a sunny day. The atmosphere was super relaxed- it really made for the perfect afternoon. The live music was also a huge plus.  We didn't sample their food this time; but it looked SO delicious; and will definitely try it next time. I highly recommend Tennessee Brew Works for a fun afternoon with friends or family! I'm already looking for an opportunity to go back. [REVIEW_3] As a new Englander I have experience with many Dunkins and this is by far the worst I have EVER been to and I have been to a lot.   Some highlights include: - milk/ cream that tastes sour - red hair in my drink - overall unsanitary - debatably some of the rudest customer service   I tell my friends that this isn't what Dunkins is about who don't have many where they are from. Unfortunately this a sad excuse for a franchise [REVIEW_4] In honor of National Pizza Day I figured I would update my review for Pi Pizzeria!   My friend and I met for dinner last night at Pi in the loop. I was easily able to find parking across the street at a meter since I arrived right before 6 pm. My friend found a parking spot pretty easily too up the street from Pi.   When I arrived I was greeted by the hostess and I let her know that I would have a friend joining. Since the place wasn't filled with customers we had a pretty easy time finding a table. I opted for the table for 2 by the window so that we could people-watch. It's a good place for that. Since I arrived a few minutes before my friend I didn't want to order anything so when our server; Mark; came over I just opted to have water while I waited for my friend.   Once my friend arrived; Mark came over and asked if she needed anything and then gave us some time to chat and look over the menu. I think he knew when we were ready to order because his timing was perfect. We decided to split the large green Greek salad and we ordered a small thin crust East Loop which has mozzarella; roasted chicken; mushroom ; red onion and basil pesto. She and I both agreed on this pizza without much hesitation. We decided to stick to drinking water.   Mark brought over our salad pretty quickly and asked if we needed cracked pepper which of course we asked for some. She and I were enjoying our salad and Mark made sure our water glasses were filled at all times. By the time our pizza came out we had finished our salad and were ready for the good stuff! The pizza looked and smelled amazing. It was the perfect size for the 2 of us too. The mushrooms were so fresh and tasty and all the other flavors combined were perfect. Mark came over a few times to make sure we had everything we needed and offered to split the check when we were finished eating.   It was a nice night out and the service and pizza were both exactly what we needed. Pi does a great job of offering menu items for everyone and I will continue to go back to try their pizzas! [REVIEW_5] My wife and I loved everything about this diner. The decor is lovely & the food was great. I had the cheese steak and it was much better than Geno's.  Our server was awesome [REVIEW_6] I was fortunate to come across this lovely place! As a sushi lover; I've always been apprehensive about sushi burritos because it sounds like too much rice and not enough variety. I was very wrong. The sushi burrito is perfection. It is the perfect lunch because it's fresh and light. The serving size is plentiful and the ingredients are very fresh.   It is set up like a chipotle and you pick what ingredients you would like. I would recommend adding a topping with some crunch like wonton crisps because it really adds to the overall texture. The tuna is definitely my favorite! Overall; it's an awesome lunch spot. Highly recommend. [REVIEW_7] Our group of 6 decided to try something different.  So;  we gave this place a shot.   Very happy with our decision.   The wife and I shared the special;  which was a massive amount of food for the two of us.   It was a great sampling of all their food options.   The chicken; steak and rice/beans were pretty amazing.  I could do without the egg;  but it was easy enough to push over to the side.   I'm not a fan of Yuca; but this wasn't bad.   The plantains were delicious.   I didn't try the salad... Just wasn't in the mood for it.   All in all;  the place is a must visit if you are up for trying something new. [REVIEW_8] Let me start out by saying that I am a nut for good sushi. Out of probably 200 sushi bars I have been to; there are only 9 places in the world that I have been to that meet my criteria to be called a ""good"" sushi bar. Three are in Japan; 2 are in Los Angeles; 1 is in San Francisco; 2 are in New York; and then there's this place in sh*tty old Philadelphia; a 5 minute cab ride from my apartment in Center city. Izumi is nothing short of excellent in every way. Any good food starts out with good ingredients. Making good traditional sushi is very simple: use good quality rice; prepared properly; excellent fish; and a dab of some good home-made ""wasabi"". Most places suck at all or some of these things. Not this place. Small restaurant with maybe 4 staffers including one in the front-of-house. Hardest working people in the restaurant industry; those FOH guys. Probably only 30-35 seats; but when the place is full; they are running around like crazy; serving food; taking orders; busing tables; and seating new parties. The wait can be long; but it is worth it. All of the fish I have had there (virtually every fish on the menu) has been perfect as sashimi and sushi; and their maki rolls are good as well. Special shout-outs for the tuna; salmon; super-white tuna (don't eat too much because of high wax content and digestive issues); and the oh toro. All are excellent in texture; quality; taste; and preparation. If you like spicy tuna rolls; you won't eat them again at your local neighborhood sushi joint. Each order is prepared individually from a filet of tuna scraped with a spoon. There's no giant tub of tuna scraps in the back mixed with mayo and a little sririacha served all day.   The good food doesn't stop at the sushi; though. Their slow roasted beef shortrib is nothing short of ""oh-my-goodness this is amazing"".  We first visited Izumi by accident about 2 or 3 months ago; and now find ourselves there once a week. It's that good. [REVIEW_9] I am a torta torta man!!  I like the crispy bread oh yeah.  And I will write no more lyrics.  I have been here three times now and every time has been solid.  I have been slightly inactive on yelp and I am dusting off my yelp chops with a few reviews.    First time I had there lunch taco specials.  Really tasty; portions are nicely sized.  It is a realistic amount to eat for lunch.  The food is fresh and really taste.  However the next two times I had the fish torta lunch special.  That is the rub my friends.  It is a great value for a huge piece of nicely cooked fish with some really tasty golden potatoes.   I would recommend trying one.  Also this place is really well decorated.  A really great aesthetic.  Only minuses can be a bit on the noisy side when it is crowded; and the chairs / benches are wicked on the butt. [REVIEW_10] Great food. Great prices. Everything is homemade and very delicious. They are very friendly and smiling all the time. Ask them about the name of the place. [REVIEW_11] Poor selection of slot machines.  Tried the buffet and had bad service. Never had anyone check up on me or even get me a refill with an empty cup sitting on the table over half an hour. Food was also not good quality. Also felt sick the next day.  Went to a concert and it was delayed but they did not allow the band to play their full set.  I would still come back for concerts but not for any other reason. Also I would eat off property first. [REVIEW_12] One of the first places we ate when we moved to Florida. Everything was wonderful! Amazing food and really nice staff. Definitely in our top 5 of best bbq!!!! [REVIEW_13] My kitty and I love this sushi place!! We love the ratio of fish to rice. Some people have commented on the size of the rolls being small but we like not having the rice ""filler"" wrapped around the outside. And order the Las Vegas roll ... It's the best one in town! I even order one to go for Mr. pockets! The family that owes it is as cute as the place! The Eastside needs not go any further for awesome sushi! [REVIEW_14] Lots of improvements to this place. Much more comfortable environment now.  The chairs could be a bit more comfortable as it'd be nice to sit through an entire football game. Otherwise; this place has really improved. [REVIEW_15] Awful noise and constant interruptions by staff to ask how things are going.  Ridiculous dancing. Etc. never again...goy a headache in about 10 minutes! [REVIEW_16] My wife and regularly stop in for clams and a glass of wine. May not sound like much; it it's like dying and going to heaven! Amazing clams - it's the broth that takes them over the top. Dinner at the bar with drinks is as good as it gets in Tucson. [REVIEW_17] I stopped here at my stop to Santa Barbara; coming down to LA from San Francisco. The food was amazing; and delicious. I would recommend anyone who like authentic Mexican food to stop and eat here. Good place. [REVIEW_18] The best hospital around! Temple has an enormous selection of departments and their doctors are some of the very best in the world.   The medical school itself is nationally ranked and the hospital campus improved every day.  Don't park more than two blocks away or your car will be on blocks when you get back; but you can't really blame the hospital for having bad neighbors. [REVIEW_19] Buffet for lunch is AMAZING!!!!! Best service with amazing food choices on their buffet. for 10 bucks a person this place super rocks! [REVIEW_20] Its a great place for Brunch. We tried the Wildflower Triple where you can substitute any of the 3 items with sausage or biscuit or anything else. We couldn't figure out which one we wanted to try; so this choice was easy!  The food was spectacular and the service was very friendly!  We are here for two more days; so we might come back tomorrow or the day after.",17
29,"[REVIEW_1] First time here - absolutely LOVE it....so happy!!!  The food extraordinary (especially smoked soft shell crab appetizer)... we all had the flounder - and all loved it. The converted church also amazing...love the settings. [REVIEW_2] Horrible!!! Not only did i wait over and hour and 40 mins for delivery my order was wrong and apparently the use a cell phone as their business phone and every time I called to inform them my order was wrong the kept hitting the button to send the call to voicemail! I will never order from there again and I can't see them staying in business for very long If that's how they run their business. [REVIEW_3] Bubble tea is probably the only sweet thing in life that I absolutely have to have; and while this place is a bit out of the way; I go here quite often to get my fix. The flavors are damn good; despite being powdered mixes. Cleanliness is A+. Decor is cute and bright. I was so stoked that they didn't just have basic fruit flavors; but also taro; red bean; jasmine; et cetera. Much more authentic in terms of product and taro is my shit. SO good. They have traditional tapioca and bursting boba with fruity flavors. It's also in a strip mall with a really; really good Asian restaurant next door (Cantonese?) and by Cirilla's. Kill two birds with one stone; right? Kidding. Sort of. I haven't tried anything else here; but friends have all raved about everything from the froyo to the boba; so I'd definitely say it's a solid place overall.   Only complaint would be: do NOT go during rush hour. Holy shit; I live in Broad Ripple and it took over an hour to get there. I mean rush hour is necessary evil; but this is terrible. Completely my fault for not paying attention to the time; but wow; that is an incredibly nerve-wrecking experience under those circumstances. Just avoid the mini-van; suburban 5:00PM rush and you'll be fine. [REVIEW_4] This place is a scam. They serve drinks where you do not taste the alcohol. The bartenders complain about the tip you leave. I've never been to a bar that is so disrespectful to customers. I will never go there again bunch of young kids with no class. Place will be closed in 6 months. [REVIEW_5] 3.5 stars for the food.  A big fat Zero 0.0 for their service/ownership/management.    This place use to be a regular stop for my family and I; but NO more.  My mother; a regular customer; stopped by shortly before lunch time along with my 1 year old child.  She selected a table in the corner because she didn't want to inconvenience customers that may enter; since she had a stroller.  The waiter approached and didn't even even greet her.    Absolutely no other customers were in the restaurant yet she still had to flag down the waiter to order.    8 minutes after her soup was served; and midway through eating her meal; the waiter just plopped the check on the table without her asking for it (very classy).  My mother took the bad service in stride and even left a %15 tip.    As she left with my kid in hand; another waiter ran after her and flagged her down in the parking lot...apparently the owner stated the $10 bill she left was too old and wrinkly...not torn; or damaged; just wrinkly.  My mother didn't want to create a scene; so she took her wrinkly money back; paid with a credit card with no tip; ha!    Anyways; food is okay; but it's certainly a shame both service and ownership are such wrinkle-free-money nazis.    My tip: bring new sequential dollars bills fresh from the bank if you want to eat here.  Needless to say my family and friends will all keep our distance; since our money is literally no good there. [REVIEW_6] Went on a Monday to have a daiquiri and watch a little bit of the NBA basketball game.  Asked the young lady working if she would be willing to turn on the game and was told she was watching Netflix.  I guess customer service is not important anymore.  Won't ever go back. [REVIEW_7] This place was disgusting! We used to eat here quite a bit but it sure has gone downhill fast! The place was dirty (garbage cans overflowing; garbage left on tables because the garbage cans couldn't be used). Nothing was filled up (sauce cups; napkins; silverware). The chicken was very dry and couldn't even be cut with the plaatic knife! Well it was good while it lasted but they have seen the last of me! [REVIEW_8] Where to start. The coleslaw was amazing and fresh good fresh crunch. Fries seasoned just right; tartar sauce and the FISH the  fresh; clean; battered perfect and meaty. [REVIEW_9] Terrible service. Went at 1pm on a Saturday and waited 25 minutes for my order (there were 2 ppl ahead of me with normal; single sandwich orders). First; the guy didn't know how to make my sandwich (a black forest ham) and skipped to the next guy in line until he could get the girl in the back to come make it; leaving me just standing there getting passed over in line. He then put the condiments on and put on an insane amount of mustard. I didn't ask for extra; I just said mustard; thinking he'd run it back and forth 2 or 3 times and that's it. Nope; he squeezed the crap out of the bottle and completely drenched it. Then he can't work the cash register; only the girl can. Just one thing after another.    I then go out front to eat and hear a car at the drive thru placing an order on the touch screen kiosk (which is actually a really good idea); but the girl inside is telling them over the mic they have to come inside to order; that they can't place there order in the drive thru. Employees at this location seriously need some training or help. Go to another location if you can. [REVIEW_10] Returned to get a fill and pedicure a week after getting a gel polish change; once I discovered the cost would be over $85 I canceled the pedicure and only wanted a fill. Originally the owner was very nice and attentive but when she sensed I refused to pay their ridiculous price; she turned her attention completely off of me and showed absolutely no regard. She no longer cared for my business and she had no problem showing it. She even reassigned the nail tech to someone else bc I refused to be over charged for service. I asked why the original nail tech was no longer doing my fill; I got no answer. I looked over and saw the owner catering to customers that had just walked in. I sensed flaky business so I ultimately walked out without being serviced. Horrible customer service from the owner. I understand they use quality products but not everyone is looking to spend hundreds of dollars in a nail salon regardless of how ""high end"" it's self proclaimed to be! [REVIEW_11] Beware that this place charges $18 per day for parking and a ""resort fee"" of $15 for internet access; 2 bottles of water a day and on line access to a newspaper site. I reserved our room on line; and only found out about these fees when looking at the reviews on yelp when trying to find if any of the restaurants in the resort were worth trying. I called and spoke to a manager on duty about these fees and she refused to refund the fees since I checked the terms and conditions box on the reservations page. I informed the MOD that I had neglected to read all of the terms and conditions; therefore she refused to help. After returning home I looked at the terms and conditions on the reservations page; where the check box appears and indeed it does tell of the $15 resort fee; but fails to mention the $18 parking fee.   This room was $250 per night before taxes. The room was nothing special. I've stayed in La Quinta Inns and other places that were just as nice; if not better; for far less.   I also was left wondering what happened to the southern hospitality that us southerners are supposed to be so well known for.  When I pay $250 a night for a room; I don't expect to be charged exorbitant fees for things I get for free at far less expensive hotels. [REVIEW_12] I COULD HAVE MADE A BETTER PIZZA AT HOME !! STAY AWAY !! THE WORST PIZZA I HAVE HAD IN THE AREA !!   Rather than just ramble without substantial factual basis to back it up; let me describe this pizza. The sauce was partially cold; spicy in a bad way; and tasted out of the can. The dough tasted liked it was picked up off the floor after it had been cleaned with 409. The toppings and cheese were equally disturbing. All this for a large pizza for a $40.00 tab.   The place needs to be shut down. [REVIEW_13] OMG!!! I can't believe this kind of service exists!  My husband called to make an appointment for full detailing for next Sat with Michael; he called again to confirm on Fri before we head there since it's a distance from our home.  Michael said he didn't know we wanted to do full detailing thou we specifically mentioned that.  He advised us to come the following sat instead.  We agreed and we reached there at 8am on the following week.  Guess what?  Nobody is at the workshop; it's closed!  We called him and he said he is busy and will call back.. We waited for half an hour in our car and there is still no call from him.  We headed for our breakfast and came back again at 9:30am hoping to give him another chance.  Here comes Alex; his partner opening the shop at 9:30am!  1.5 hours away from our appt time and still no sight of Michael.  Alex tried calling Michael and couldn't get hold of him.  We gave up!!! What a horrendous experience! [REVIEW_14] Wallet was stolen today at this starbucks.  The workers there were not helpful at all.  They wanted me to ""file a report"" to corporate and would call if it showed up.  Meanwhile someone was having fun with my credit card in cherry hill; new jersey.  And they made it seem like it was my fault that it was stolen; but it was stolen when i was sitting with my items. Not helpful or sympathetic. [REVIEW_15] Buckingham Pizza makes the best pizza around; particularly its plain pizza and a few of its specialities -- try the cool ranch pizza. This is a pizza parlor. Don't get fancy....order the pizzas and maybe some sides. While some of the entrees are good (chicken piccata); stay with the pizza and you'll love it. [REVIEW_16] Our Lhasa just had puppies on Sunday night.  She was doing great until Thursday; when we noticed her getting a little slow and not wanting to eat.  We decided friday when we both got home from work; to take her in.  This place was the closest and recommend by our vet clinic for emergency service.  They wanted to do a series of test and x-rays.  I was fine with the blood work but really wasn't excited about dosing our poor little girl with radiation for the x-rays.  The Vet told me it was necessary.  So we sucked up the $650 charge and had the work done.    At this time the Vet said there was not an elevated white cell count and that the dog was not dehydrated.  I asked about maybe a course of nursing friendly antibiotics. The vet recommended that we do immediate surgery to extract her uterus.  We did plan on having the dog spayed but this was a big shock.  The poor little dog just had puppies; was nursing and now they wanted to fillet her open! WTF?! How could they possibly think this was a good idea.  Not only that; it was getting a little annoying how every time they recommended something; they would step out and come back with a piece of paper stating they wanted your next paycheck up front.  So we declined the $3;000 emergency surgery; paid our $650 bill and left with a course of antibiotics.  Our little dog is doing just fine.  She had a mild infection but kicked it. Glad we have enough education and experience to have made the most conservative and preservative decision of our dog.    And I won't even get into the story about when we saw the $3000 estimate for surgery and the Vet said that if it was not affordable; some people do choose to euthanize.  I grew up on a ranch; I work emergency medicine; and understand the circle of life; but this place just plain baffled me.  It seemed more like a place that wanted to ring you dry for cash rather than try to help you make the right decision for you and your animal.  We told our regular vet about our experience and she was even pretty taken back about the price of everything.   Will we not return. [REVIEW_17] First time at Tara's and I'm sure I'll be back!  I wish I knew my nail tech's name because he was really terrific. I came in to get a gel refill and one tip replaced. My nails needed a lot of work and he didn't cut any corners. I'm really particular about the thickness of my nails and I've had people give me gruff for asking for them thinner; my guy today did them perfectly from the start and was very willing to make changes when I briefly questioned the thickness (I couldn't tell they were perfect already because there was still dust on them from shaving them into shape). And in the end; the price was more than fair for the quality of work!   Regarding the mani/pedi situation: I didn't get either but I witnessed one of each while I was there and I think anyone would be happy and relaxed getting one.  Also; I took notice that the place was really clean; which is comforting. And they played modern music; which I prefer to the classical or sound machine noises some places play. [REVIEW_18] Very quick and professional place. Nichole is my specialist and she is beyond amazing. Love the packages. [REVIEW_19] Off the ""beaten path"" however a great breakfast spot. Very good service along with a well versed menu. The Monterey Omelette; good sized portion cooked to perfection. Scott kept our water glass & coffee cup full. The fresh fruit cup was refreshing. One of the best  breakfast restaurants & high marks all around. [REVIEW_20] The Owner is just as rude & crazy as the manager.  He refuses to listen to employee's & customer complaints.  I'd stay FAR away from this place.  Even the Spring Hill owner said people call his store complaining about the manager at Little Road.  Other employees I spoke with said she's awful to work for and people complain about her all of the time.  They fired a waitress for not being able to come in on her OFF day due to the flooded roads.  She WASN'T scheduled that day.  I'm calling the news stations;BBB & the Labor Board since the owner won't listen either.  I hope people hear this story and boycott your business!  You would've saved yourself grief if you would've just listened Steve!  Already have posted to FB and many friends said they will no longer eat there.",7
30,"[REVIEW_1] Food was not well seasoned. They said they were understaffed and there was staff sitting in the dining room on laptops. The salsa was very bland. Had the enchiladas supremas and was very disappointed. [REVIEW_2] 3.5 stars for the food.  A big fat Zero 0.0 for their service/ownership/management.    This place use to be a regular stop for my family and I; but NO more.  My mother; a regular customer; stopped by shortly before lunch time along with my 1 year old child.  She selected a table in the corner because she didn't want to inconvenience customers that may enter; since she had a stroller.  The waiter approached and didn't even even greet her.    Absolutely no other customers were in the restaurant yet she still had to flag down the waiter to order.    8 minutes after her soup was served; and midway through eating her meal; the waiter just plopped the check on the table without her asking for it (very classy).  My mother took the bad service in stride and even left a %15 tip.    As she left with my kid in hand; another waiter ran after her and flagged her down in the parking lot...apparently the owner stated the $10 bill she left was too old and wrinkly...not torn; or damaged; just wrinkly.  My mother didn't want to create a scene; so she took her wrinkly money back; paid with a credit card with no tip; ha!    Anyways; food is okay; but it's certainly a shame both service and ownership are such wrinkle-free-money nazis.    My tip: bring new sequential dollars bills fresh from the bank if you want to eat here.  Needless to say my family and friends will all keep our distance; since our money is literally no good there. [REVIEW_3] Came for all-you-can-eat; and ended up waiting for over half an hour to get our order in. The servers completely ignored us; while taking orders from the tables around us. And on top of that; all of the rolls contain ""extras"" not listed on the menu. One roll surprised us by having sweet mustard sauce on it; which did NOT taste very good.... On the bright side; once we actually got our orders in they didn't take all that long to make them. [REVIEW_4] Freaky fast is a joke here.  It regularly takes over a hour to receive a lunch delivery from this location.  After three instances of this I am done.  I will not order from this location again. [REVIEW_5] Super nice staff; great service. Always on time and on the ball to put you at ease. Oh; and they never leave me feeling guilty or scolded when I admit I don't floss every day - just a quick word of encouragement. [REVIEW_6] Reading the other reviews; I would have to agree that if one wants to 'wander through' a voo doo shop in New Orleans; this is the place to go.  But if one is actually seeking to embrace the art; it is even better than a shop; it is a spiritual mecca.  The people here are not the stereotypical 'scary' folks from television and film; they are lovely; genuine people whose practice is founded in a belief centered around helping others.  Without being an expert in the field; I can say that they counsel and practice from the best of places.  And the charms they made for my new office worked! (They are the first to tell you that any juju for success must be coupled with effort and skill; but just the same; we've been remarkably successful early on; and I know their blessings were in part responsible).  Love them.  Will be back in April; as they are a must stop shop; whatever the reason for dropping in. [REVIEW_7] This place is over priced; it was totally empty on a Friday night at 9:30.... Disappointed that I didn't look at the menu before coming here and just looked at the rating. The quality of the food is completely off. They didn't give us utensils to begin with. I am disappointed. [REVIEW_8] Worst pharmacy ever!!! I had to transfer a medication to a pharmacy that was closer to me; but do you think anyone can get a hold of anyone on the phone? The pharmacy tried for days and I tried for a long time and nothing!!!  Worst customer service ever! [REVIEW_9] Returned to get a fill and pedicure a week after getting a gel polish change; once I discovered the cost would be over $85 I canceled the pedicure and only wanted a fill. Originally the owner was very nice and attentive but when she sensed I refused to pay their ridiculous price; she turned her attention completely off of me and showed absolutely no regard. She no longer cared for my business and she had no problem showing it. She even reassigned the nail tech to someone else bc I refused to be over charged for service. I asked why the original nail tech was no longer doing my fill; I got no answer. I looked over and saw the owner catering to customers that had just walked in. I sensed flaky business so I ultimately walked out without being serviced. Horrible customer service from the owner. I understand they use quality products but not everyone is looking to spend hundreds of dollars in a nail salon regardless of how ""high end"" it's self proclaimed to be! [REVIEW_10] Ignorant bartender. Took forever for him to wait on you at a table on a Sunday afternoon; not even during football season.  Lesson learned. Never have a bartender wait on you for food.  Number 1; they don't want to do it; but also; they don't know the menu or anything about the kitchen when you ask a question. This is a typical suburban blue collar and millennial underwhelming establishment to watch Sports in with a pint of flat Budweiser. It is perfect for blue collars who swear that walk in dressed like they just finished a 10 hr day either painting; fixing drains; or laying down planks; or up on a roof. After 10 or 11pm the DB millennials roll in; espec on weekends. [REVIEW_11] Had the gyro salad and it was large; filling; and delicious. Service was quick and super friendly. The menu had a lot of tasty looking options and I hope to try more soon. Great value too. [REVIEW_12] Find another pharmacy!  I have had bad experience after bad experience at this pharmacy.  First; they are incredibly slow.  There's often a long line of cars at the drive through window.  Even when there are no customers at the pharmacy counter inside; they seem to take a break between cars; making everyone wait for no reason whatsoever.  Recently; I went to pick up a prescription I have been taking for years.  After I paid; but before she handed me my medicine; the woman told me I had to wait and talk to the pharmacist.  I explained that I had the flu and that I had been taking that medication at that dosage for years and I really didn't want to wait for the pharmacist.  I just wanted to get home before I threw up again.  She told me it would be illegal for her to give me the medicine without talking to the pharmacist.  That is a bold faced lie.  It may violate Walgreens's policy; but it is not illegal.  Ask an attorney or any non-Walgreens pharmacy.  Finally; I was prescribed two medicines that cannot be taken together.  This Walgreens filled both prescriptions; repeatedly.  When I found out about the potentially deadly interaction between the two medicines; I pointed it out to the pharmacist very politely.  First; he had no idea those medicines were contraindicated.  Second; he acted like it was no big deal at all.  He never said sorry or we'll look into it or anything.  He just said something like; ""So you want me to take X medication off automatic refill?""  I was shocked.  I left a message for Walgreens to complain about that issue; but I never got a return call.  Time to find another pharmacy. [REVIEW_13] First time there and it was excellent!!! It feels like your are entering someone's home. The waiters there funny and nice. The food come out very quickly and it is phenomenal!!! Definitely will be going back to this place. [REVIEW_14] I just called to place a delivery order and they stated they could not do it. I have to come into the store if I wanted to get food from them. WHAT!!!! [REVIEW_15] They never shipped the item and its been 18 days. They don't answer their phone or email and after I leave a message; they don't call back. It seems like they are basically running a scam.  I would avoid dealing with them as they do not fulfill their orders or believe in any customer service. [REVIEW_16] I used to go here for breakfast often when we lived in Tucson. Now we make a point to go back when we visit and I am always happy with their breakfasts. We've loved everything on the breakfast menu; but my favorite is still the fresh herbs omelette. Service is usually good; even when they're busy. I love how there is indoor and outdoor seating. We have never been for dinner; but I have had lunch there (beautiful salad!). A terrific locally-owned restaurant! [REVIEW_17] OMG!  This is by far the worst Thai food I have ever eaten.  The food was bland; and seemed reheated in a microwave.  The restaurant had an odd odor; the bathrooms were dirty; the phone rang extremely loud during our entire dinner; the service was slow and the employees were less than attentive and not very friendly.  In addition; I left my Maui Jim sunglasses there and called to see if they could mail (i'd pay for any mailing cost) them to me since I live out of state. they stated they were too busy and didn't have time EVER to mail them.... [REVIEW_18] While friendly enough; too many mistakes were made for me to ignore. First; I didn't receive my soda; and had to go get my waiter and ask him for it again. Not too big a deal; but then my daughter's chicken enchilada...had no chicken. We'd already begun eating; and our waiter hadn't come around to see if everything was OK. I asked her if she wanted to send it back but she said no; so; fine. The food itself was OK. We were hungry; we ate it. Her kid's meal was around $6.50; my crispy tacos $7.50; and my soda was $2. I noticed the prices on the menu; but wasn't adding up my bill ahead of time or anything because that's; you know; the restaurant's job. So I didn't blink when a check totaling $22.51 came; and I didn't pay any mind about tipping %20 (despite the faults; I've been a server before; so I can understand). In the end I paid $28. It was after we were long gone that I realized the total Should have been closer to $16; not $22.51. Did I get the wrong check and not notice? Did they add gratuity to a teeny little party of two without even telling me? Either way; that's a big no-no; right?  I wasn't being on my toes I guess; but I still feel a little ripped off. Ultimately they received more money than I personally thought the whole experience was worth; hence my poor star rating. Oh; and my butt was on fire all the next day; so there. [REVIEW_19] I went to Jin after finding her good reviews on Yelp to alter my wedding dress. First time I want to alter my zipper so it works better and widen my arm holes. Job was done; I did not see much of difference; zipper was still not working well and the arm holes were still tight but little better. Second time I went to Jin to alter the bottom part of my wedding dress. It was ""puffy"" and I want to remove some material from it so it would be more flat. Jin agreed and she was very nice. She made very good impression on me although sometimes it was not so easy to understand her. Which we talked about and I understand since English is not my first language either. I came for first fitting and we both agreed on material to be removed. Jin quoted me final price. She kept saying it is so much work; so much work. That was little annoying already cause at the end of the day I was willing to pay as much as quoted for it and I was not happy with her saying that dress is fine. If I am not happy with it; it is not fine. I came for ""final fitting"" and I was not happy. In my opinion not enough material was removed and Jin agreed it was her mistake so she would fix it. The last time I came was yesterday. I thought it was only for fitting so I did not bring money for payment. The dress was ready. I looked at it and my heart dropped. The front of dress had one quarter size BLOOD stain and one 5 times bigger BLOOD smudge right in front of my WHITE WEDDING DRESS. I am sure any women can emphasized with terror I felt. First Jin said she does not know what it is. Then she admitted it is blood and it happens all the time (!). No apologies. She came with Hydrogen Peroxide and cleaned the stains.... Now my dress smells great. She said it is fine cause I need to dry clean it either way cause she did not keep dress in garment bag and it is all dusty at the bottom! I got super upset cause dress was clean and ready to be wear on my wedding day that is next week! Anyway I just took dress and went to try it on. She kept saying it was so much work and it took her long and I understood that and I was ready to give her extra tip. But I was not saying anything cause 1) I was trying on the dress and 2) I was still so angry and not in mood for small talk. I came out; dress was ok. Jin was getting more and more angry cause she saw I was not too responsive. She told me she will never do this job again; it is not worth it; and no money from it; so long work. I understand all that but she quoted my price and she made a mistake. She knew what has to be done and she agreed to it. I do not understand why I have to be responsible here. The worst part was the end of visit when and sooooo uncalled for; she got so angry she started yelling at me cause I was still not happy about the stains. And she said she has no money from it and she will not pay for the stains she made. This was so disrespectful and not necessary. I decided instead of picking up dress today I would go back home for my wallet and just get it over with. She was still yelling when I left. I cried on my way home; my fiancé went back with me cause I was so shaken. He was waiting outside (I did not want him to see dress). She was again rude and disrespectful; yelled so much I could not say word in between. I just asked her to please count the money cause I want to leave. She took money and I left.  I normally never add reviews with unpleasant experience cause I do not want to be reason of anyone losing business but I never was treated so disrespectfully in my life. I do not recommend this place. Yes it is cheap but your garments are not treated with care and you may ended up paying more at the end.  I wish I could give 0 stars. [REVIEW_20] Just went here for breakfast.  The food was just OK; the service wasn't particularly great; in fact our server seemed fairly put out anytime we asked for anything.  What really made this a one star experience;  though; was the 6 or 7 year old boy (who was not a customer; possibly our server's son) who was hammering away on the piano the whole time we were there.   We asked our server to ask him to take a break and she was not thrilled but said ok.  She said something to him and he stopped... for about 30 seconds.  Then right back to hammering on the piano keys.   Who wants to pay for breakfast and have to listen to someone hammer away arbitrarily on a piano??? Will never go back.",5
31,"[REVIEW_1] Amazingness! Went tonight and had an awesome beer...an awesome burger...and awesome onion rings! We got the three little piggies burger and it was delicious...and huge! Thankfully I split it with my husband... This will Definately be the stop next time I'm in Reno! [REVIEW_2] I went to Sparkle Car Wash last night at 5:52 pm.  As soon as I entered the parking lot I noticed the sign that read they were open until 6pm.  They; however; were not open.  I was very disappointed.  Closing early is poor customer service!  It's no wonder they haven't gotten too many positive reviews. [REVIEW_3] This is probably one of my favorite burgers I've had in a while. I'm not a terribly into burgers; so that's saying something. I got the 4 Cheese Garlic burger with a side of Mac and cheese; both delicious. The buns are definitely one of the best parts of the burger. My boyfriend got the 96 with a side of fries and loved it. The only thing I would say is that the patties are very thick. So; if you're a thin burger lover; this isn't for you. To finish; I got the ABC milkshake-- AMAZING. You can see my reaction in the photo. Overall; delicious and will be back again. [REVIEW_4] I was in the market for a car and went here to look. They didn't really have what I wanted; but my car salesman found one I might like about a week later. I decided to put $1;000 down to save the car so I could think about it. The salesman said that the money would be refunded in full if I decided I didn't want the car. I decided THAT DAY to NOT purchase the car and informed the salesman. The $1;000 had already been charged to my account and now it's taken over 2 WEEKS and my refund still hasn't gone through. This is a nightmare; I wish I had never given them my deposit. I feel SO stupid for trusting in them.    On top of that; the salesman was so over-the-top with his hyper energy; it made me anxious. He kept urging me to ""sign today; sign today."" He even went as far as to show up unannounced at my place of work. He had brought a car off the lot to show me. I felt so violated and uncomfortable.      They may have the car you are looking for but don't let them push you; don't give them your number and be CAREFUL with signing anything and giving them money. [REVIEW_5] Walking up upon the Schermerhorn Symphony Center; you can't help to marvel at the beauty of the statues and facade. The classic Romanesque architecture is as compelling in size as its design.   For my first symphony; I attended the free yearly symphony this past Saturday. Having a deep understanding of modern and contemporary music; my sense of audio innocence for this show provided a pure experience.   During the first piece; I was overwhelmed by the senses of emotion from the insight into sounds surreal. Each successive song brought me to a different state of emotion. Sadness and pain - comfortableness - excitement and joy.  The acoustics of the hall are simply and totally consuming. You feel completely surrounded by sound. Although we sat directly center of the stage; we noticed that the balcony's were also reacting in applause in a similar manner. I bet the view from there is more amazing. You could then see each musician as they added their contribution to the influence over your feelings.  Walking around the outside gardens; you really begin to notice the architecture. There are flowers and fountains adorning many areas of the facility.   Its without saying; you must consider attending a symphony here once in your life. I still have little knowledge about who wrote what; the name of the piece/song/tune. However; I do know that the experience rivaled nearly every concert I have attend. And I have: There are many shows under my belt.   There was a new appreciation and connection to sound that I left with that transforming evening... [REVIEW_6] Came in to order coctel de camaron my food had no avocado no cilantro asked the waiter as to why it did not have it they said they were out of avocado and did not know why it had no cilantro. Just said ;I can take the plate back poor customer service it seemed like they didn't care. Very disappointing; how can a restaurant not have avocado and what's worst nobody seemed to care. I was so eager to eat this establish food now am just leaving wothout eating nothing. [REVIEW_7] Such good coffee! And I love the vibe in here - it reminds me of a quirky coffee house that would be in Portland. They take their time making you your drink too. Favorite in St. Pete! [REVIEW_8] Oh hertz shuttle; never to be found.  There goes avis again.  Alamo and national.  Sadly I stay loyal because you actually provide service outside of missouri. [REVIEW_9] Have you tried their Briscut?  OMG it is the best.  Their Chix salad out of this world!  Yes they do ""sell out"" of stuff because it is ALWAYS fresh.  Need something in a jiffy; they will make it happen.  I truly love dealing with Fred and Julia!  Oh; and their corned beef special!  Try that.  Wait; also their Cabbage Soup! [REVIEW_10] I used to be a regular here when I lived close by. After moving away from the area I've been searching for quality sushi ever since. I've found good sushi in various places; but have always found them somewhat lacking. Over time I guessed nostalgia was overwhelming my objective opinion and Kaisen was probably not as wonderful as my memory told me. So imagine my delight when I revisited and found that it was not nostalgic remembrances but actual fact!   The sushi was as good; maybe even better than I remembered; the service the same.  This is without doubt my favorite sushi restaurant; not just in Tampa bay but anywhere.  From now on when the sushi craving craving strikes I'll make the effort and drive 40 minutes to enjoy the real deal. [REVIEW_11] They charge $2 more for tomato mozzarella sandwich then the regular stand-alone Starbucks do. [REVIEW_12] Suuuuuperrrr knowledgeable staff - enjoyed Brigid and Alex tour of the refrigerated section and sours knowledge. Food is ridiculous! in the co-op attached independently owned kitchen called The Nook OMGGGGG DUCK patty on a bed of greens since I did t want bun... to die for!!! Thanks Bridgette for the Spurs tasters to decide what was right for me. Memorable experience - I WILL BE BACK WITH FRIENDS  - oh and they have wine too. [REVIEW_13] I did have a bad review for this restaurant; but now that the manager has made contact with me and cleared up the issue; I decided to change my review. Not only is the food amazing; but the service is extremely friendly and cares about your food. Five stars from me. [REVIEW_14] This place is smack dab in the middle of DA HOOD! The menu offerings are quite extensive and everything is made when you order.  The subs come in 3 sizes and even the ""small"" is quite large.   The subs are loaded with meats and cheese and additional items if you want them.  I will be back to try more! [REVIEW_15] I thought this was a great addition to downtown St. Pete and was thrilled to have a local place with an extensive selection of spices being that I am a cook. However; the owners are gay hating bigots! This isn't a review on the shop or the product; but a review to let the LGBT community to stay away! I have shopped a few times and each time have been treated differently than the straight people shopping in the shop. The only reason I returned was to make sure my feeling was right. The male owner each time refuses to come from behind the counter to assist me. Its as if he fears he'll catch some disease by talking to a homosexual. Furthermore; I have been there with straight friends and each time have been ignored even though I am the one who need assistance in locating a certain spice. The one time his wife was around she intentionally (and randomly I might add) brought up a conversation about Chick-fil-a and MItt Romney. Again; this isn't a negative review on the shop and its contents but on the owners who cannot refrain from hiding their hatred towards a large part of the Tampa Bay community.  For those wanting to support an anti-hateful local business there are plenty on central and if you need gourmet spices visit The Fresh Market; Rollin' Oats or Earth Organics. [REVIEW_16] Where to begin; a $ 7 tip was added to my bill prior to Svc rendered. Shouldn't that be my choice. It is a gratuity is it not? My order took over 2 hours to arrive. When the gentleman arrived he did apologize for the delay. The reason I have never heard before. He told me a coworker took his car to p/u his/her daughter from school. That's a new one. So as you see; 2 hour delay does not = a $7 gratuity; nor does it = more than 1 star. [REVIEW_17] I love this place.  Love the Dan Dan noodles; dried pepper shrimp; and wontons.   Service is great.  If you want a great dining experience with excellent food; you must try this place. [REVIEW_18] I went to spa nails before and that place was terrible. I came here and had a much better experience. The nail technician listened to what I wanted and made sure that I was happy when I left. I got gold foil because I couldn't find a salon that did gold foil!   My cuticles were amazing after and the gel lasted 3-4 weeks. Definitely will be coming back when I need another manicure in Reno. [REVIEW_19] How do these guys not have any reviews yet?! Anna photographed our wedding in June of this year. She was absolutely fantastic. From the moment I chatted with her on the phone; I knew she'd be our gal for the big day. She was SO easy to talk to; none of her photos seem fake or posed; she was fun; got right in the center of things and delivered absolutely beautiful photos. I'm a gal who doesn't like to have her picture taken very much (not an especially great quality for a bride...) and she made it easy on me by getting great photos of our guests and family members (and of course; great ones of me and my fella...) Great communication the whole time; too. She was absolutely delightful and I'd recommend her to any couple looking for their photographer. [REVIEW_20] What a great place for beers and a match! Plentiful selection of beers on tap. Didn't try the food; but it looked delicious.  The best part - never miss a second of the match since there's TVs in the restroom!",13
32,"[REVIEW_1] This is my kind of place - they use fresh everything and the seasonings are expert.  The service on Friday nights is fantastic.    Over the years; the cooking has improved and is tastier than ever.  It's hard to get a seat; so plan on waiting 30 minutes on a busy night - that being said; it's not long until you are seated and promptly given water and they have real candles here.    I always order the coconut soup (I order it with the tofu ""not fried"") and also the yellow curry with tofu - also not fried.  It lends a more delicate flavor to the already rich curry.  It is to die for - tastes like dessert.  It is served with rice.  Last time I ordered the Pho - my goodness; the bowl is so huge and served with two sauces - hoisin and siracha.  Very good and filling - I would order it next time with more veggies (they are very good at helping you with special orders)  This is a BYOB and the prices can't be beat.  The menu keeps getting larger and I only wish I were closer to this place; as I would come here weekly for sure! [REVIEW_2] This is a destination restaurant perfect for a special night out. Its uniqueness makes it a perfect place to impress someone. As a more recent addition to the Bailey's group of restaurants; L'Acadiane is on par with the quality they are well known for.  If you're a fan of New Orleans style or southern food in general; you will love the St. Louis twist they put on the food here. There is just enough kick to it without being overpowering. We tried a bit of everything. The poblano grits were a favorite as well as the roffignac cocktail made with sparkling rosé- a perfect blend between the raspberry and lemon.   Randall; our server was super patient. He realized we were there to take our time; and we did not feel rushed. He did his best to answer questions and cater to allergies. Many of the menu items contain shrimp; but they are well aware this is a problem for many people and can make accommodations.   Give them a try for a southern experience close to home! [REVIEW_3] Probably the most expensive game in town. But totally worth it for me. I upgraded myself to the executive locker rooms because that gives me zero excuses for why I can't go to the gym before work or after if I am going out later that night. I always have my makeup; hair stuff; etc in my locker. Just getting back to the gym after a long absence due to health issues so I'm taking it slow. I've seen one or two machines that are not quite working right but the facility as a whole is pretty sharp & welcoming. You have tons of options of what to do classes wise; equipment wise... My only 2 down sides are that I wish they were open a little later on weekends; but that's just me moving slowly on my time off. I wish there was a bit more ritation with the class schedule. There are classes I'd like to take but they always run mid day; never really early; after work or weekends. So no option to try them. I'm sure it's an instructor issue so not likely something that will change. Overall I'm super happy that I joined. [REVIEW_4] Evething about This Resturant is great! 1- brew there own soy sauce 2 service amazing  3- food fresh; creative & amazingly good 4- everything about this small south jersey Resturant is the best around. 5- can not wait to return!! [REVIEW_5] IF YOU ARE FEMALE & YOUNG; GO SOMEWHERE ELSE  I dropped off my car and told them I needed my oil change. They were very friendly and said they would have it done quickly; which was appreciated. When I came back to pick up my car three hours later; they charged me $75 dollars for the oil change. The guy working the counter could tell I was shocked (an oil change at the dealer usually costs $35).  He explained they had used synthetic oil. When I asked why they would give me synthetic oil when I didn't ask for it; he gave me some BS answer that it was standard for Toyotas. Since he could tell I was upset; he said they were running a special and knocked down the price by 25%.   I am aware that I am a young woman and that I don't know much about cars but I do not appreciate being taken advantage of. I will be going elsewhere for car maintenance from now on.  Wish I had read the reviews before trying out this Firestone. It looks like other women have had the same experience in the past. [REVIEW_6] When I was with Charter 10 years ago their service was intermittent and customer service was horrendous. I've been a happy customer of AT&T DSL for the last eight years; but was repeatedly approached by Charter stating that they are now the best in the country; their whole network was revamped and that they now have zero issues. I signed up with Charter as of August 1 and the last 4 days were horrendous. The initial tech who was setting up the service was entirely incompetent and was asking ME questions about the router and the modem. The connection was lightning fast for about 2 days. As of yesterday the signal became weak; pages are taking 30-45 seconds to load and sometimes there is no connection at all. I called Charter and spent 15 minutes on hold; then talked to someone who hung up on me and was finally able to schedule a technician to bring a ""signal booster"" to my place. I live in Central St. Louis; not in a rural area; so apparently their ""best in the nation"" network still leaves much to be desired. [REVIEW_7] Nice relaxing place to get a massage! Same day appointments are easy to come by! I have never been disappointed with any therapist I have had at the Center! [REVIEW_8] Yummy food;  they will veganize things for you as well. The servers are friendly and the restaurant is spacious and has a bar and a stage area. We have had our work Holiday party here for the past couple years; both parties turned out great. The guacamole is awesome! [REVIEW_9] Always a great experience when I stop in. The darkness croissant and the morning bun are my favorites; but I always love trying something new each visit. [REVIEW_10] Omg. Don't go here....waited and waited for my food . When it came out only half was there...waited more for my pancakes asked for more ice tea....waited no ice teabut... the food was good [REVIEW_11] My girlfriend and I decided to give this place a try. We got cornbeef special hoagies and fried pickles. Was very delicious and we will be ordering again for sure. Delivery was quick as well. [REVIEW_12] Had a really great experience here after leaving another Thai restaurant due to a long wait time. The Tom Yum is some of the best ever... not too brothy and full of veggies as was the cashew veggie entree and the rice was great too. Great service and gracious lady behind the counter. Will return asap! [REVIEW_13] There's not much to say except that this place is magical.  Awesome candies! Pralines made on the spot.. great fudge and a cool building.. enter on Decatur; exit on Peter's.  They are so friendly you can taste your way right through the shop. So we did.  We also bought too much. Which we ate... and then wished we had more.  A worthwhile side trip; it kind of made our day! [REVIEW_14] This was surprisingly the best meal I have ever had.  Some things to know if you go and to avoid being asked to leave Sam's house:   1)  Check pretentiousness and indecisiveness at the door.  2)  Know what you want to order; he will tell you how to modify it accordingly 3)  If you go close to closing time or try to rush him; you will be asked to leave 4)  Sushi for everyone; that is why his prices are so reasonable.   5)  Everyone at one time?  Everyone will be asked to leave.  If you try to bring a huge group you will be asked to leave 6)  Get ready for a enlightening experience....  This is a very unique place because it is so unassuming. You would not go to Burger King and throw a tantrum because they did not have a Delmonico steak.  However; whatever Sam deciedes to serve to you; he will ""make it your way""  Sam Katakura knows what he is doing when he compares his sushi to the kind you buy at the grocery store.  He does not pretend to be something he is not; afterall; it is called ""Sam's sushi bar"" The food is satisfying; consistent; and good.  He will engage you in conversation and will leave you satisfied and wanting more. [REVIEW_15] You want a luxury resort to stay in? This is THE place!  I stayed in the penthouse suite and it was THE best room I HAVE EVER stayed in. I recommend anyone to try them out! They spent a lot of money on the scenery; the absolute best upscale hotel in Reno! [REVIEW_16] Zero stars for the Chicken Teriyaki Lunch Bento Box.  I have literally never seen a bento box come without rice before.    Disappoint. [REVIEW_17] I was just there last night. Awesome Italian restaurant. You are welcomed by the owner when you walk in who is very friendly and wants to ensure you are enjoying the meal and service. I can tell that the customer is extremely important to her and it shows as there is a decent wait; but it is worth it. This is my go to place for Italian food. Prices are reasonable and the plates plentiful. I typically get penne vodka with chicken. Their penne vodka sauce is second to none. What separates them from others is the apps are great; filling and just as much detail goes in the creation as their main dishes. Combine all this with BYOB and you can't go wrong. I never have room for dessert; maybe one day. If you want a consistent; reliable Italian restaurant this is it. [REVIEW_18] While back ""home"" in Philly; visiting friends in Mt Airy we decided to try Grain Exchange for lunch. A quick walk on over from their house and we were seated indoors in a sunny table by the front window. A friendly barkeep came over quickly and took drink orders. It was decided upon with vim and vigor that this vacation week would start off with cocktails. They have their own house vodka spirit; tangy citrus notes complement the vodka club with lime. I believe a beer was ordered by my friend. Food was chosen; two veggie burgers with avocado (delish); a spinach salad with berries; goat cheese and balsamic vinegar (divine);  French fries and hush puppies ( also equally satisfying). Decor is hipster with metal chairs; walls with reclaimed wood; etc.; but very welcoming and casual.  Service was attentive and as aforementioned; friendly.  Price for 4; plus 2 cocktails was $68 I believe; not including tip.  We enjoyed it so much; we decided to return tonight. Children chose chicken tenders with fries(said to be tasty); I got grilled chicken breast sandwich with avocado (wonderful and special made for me bc I chose not to do fried buttermilk chicken); seitan buffalo ""wings"" (very good; the sauce was hot and had just the right twang of vinegar). Cocktails and beer; of course... $85 not including tip. Service was the bartender; again; super friendly and helpful.  Would definitely return again. [REVIEW_19] This place is terrible.  I should have gotten a clue based on the fact that I went there with a group of 8 people on a Saturday night and there were NO other customers in the restaurant. Needless to say; I ignored the signs and ate here.  This was literally the worst Thai food I have had in my entire life.    First; I ordered the tom yum soup.  They asked me how spicy I wanted it and I responded that I wanted it spicy.  I did not expect that the entire bowl of soup would be covered in red pepper flakes.  Disgusting. I spent ten minutes picking red pepper flakes out of the soup and my mouth.      I also tried the chicken satay.  The chicken was ice cold and as dry as beef jerky. The dipping sauce was a mix between curry and Planter's honey roasted peanuts.  It was a bizarre combination like nothing I've ever had before.  Once again...Disgusting.     Finally; I ordered curry.  I had high hopes that they could not screw up everything in my order.  Boy was I wrong.  The curry was bland and just plain gross.   Overall; all 8 of the people in my group left the restaurant dissatisfied. My recommendation is that you walk two blocks down the road and eat at the Blue Elephant Thai Restaurant. [REVIEW_20] This paper was originally called the levittown news now it goes by the courier times. In the last 15 years they have consistantly reported stories the local tv ststions did 3 days prior to the courier's publishing times. Many call it the levittown liar due to some reporters injecting facts that were made up in many instances. Plus the paper takes some unusual stances on matters that they have no business doing rather than reporting both sides of the story. Many here no longer subscribe to it anymore due to delay and misinformation they publish. Perhaps at some point in the furture they will return to being a respected source of news.",14
33,"[REVIEW_1] Really great quality food. We had a baby at renown and for 3 nights in a row I ordered a different entree from this place: chicken with mixed vegetables; pho; Mongolian beef; a kung pao beef. All were really high quality and tasty. No tendon in the meet; no fat; just great food. One of my fav restaurants now. [REVIEW_2] One of the best shopping experiences one can imagine. A perfect jewel of a shop. It has the most carefully selected eye glass frames from all over the world. The service is second to none. If only all shops could be like this.  I read all the other reviews here. Apart from 2 all are 5*; clearly all these customers actually bought something; while the 2 negative ones...draw your own conclusions. [REVIEW_3] The steak is okay. I give it a 1 because it's not worth the price. Very expensive. You can find a much better steak at other restaurants in town. Plus; my experience was dampened by some annoying couple trying to sell me real estate as I ate at the bar. [REVIEW_4] Wow!  The concierge needs training ASAP!  Literally refused to move over behind the counter to put himself in front of the customer.  Your not working the register at McDonald's....adjust to the customer.  The lazy draw was the no look pass of the document we requested.  I even said; ""really? Aren't you going to say anything? Close us out? Thank you have a great day?""  The concierge just looked down. I was too much in a rush to address it.  Worst service ever.  All the staff at the hotel seem ""over it"" not motivated and irritated with the guests.  Lazy waitresses or loud talking waiters at the fine dining restaurant.  Like really?  Do you need to shout about my foi gras? When I say I didn't like it you ask me to be specific....  Well here's specific....it sucked.  Tell that to the chef.  Everything he said was so loud!  It could have been the blaring band music....yeah that was appropriate.  He actually said they ""normally"" close us when a band is here.  I also felt it to be strange that when I called for reservations earlier that morning the staff member told me there was nothing available at 8:30 or 9 but 915 was available. I came at 8:45 to have a cocktail before hand. I walked right in and proceeded to look at the restaurant empty tables. I'm not sure if the staff just doesnt want to work?  Avoid this sad staffed hotel. [REVIEW_5] I have been here twice. They just opened about 3 weeks ago. Our food and service was good and I hope they stick around! BYOB The soups are delicious especially the #1 soup w the seafood.  Very friendly staff.  They need to have their sign out up out front!  They are tucked away on the side of the shopping complex and easy to miss. [REVIEW_6] Horrible food.  Bread sticks totally dry. Mozzarella sticks more salty than salt itself. And the worst tasting; bland; fettuccine alfredo ever.  Gave it a try despite the 1.5 stars but shouldn't have risked it. Wish I could give them a zero. [REVIEW_7] I reserved a full sized car. When I arrived at my scheduled time; they had none. The salesman sold me on accepting a Kia Soul; he told me it was the equivalent of full sized vehicle. When I got home; knowing nothing about this vehicle; I did some research. It is classified as a sub compact. So Enterprise took my full payment for a full sized vehicle and completely screwed me. I don't have time to go back to the rental office; so I am stuck paying full price for a sub compact; and I have to use this vehicle for a 1400 mile trip. Never again will I use this rental agency. Don't be like me; do better research and be prepared when they try to screw you over! [REVIEW_8] If I had to choose one place for a romantic getaway in Santa Barbra I'd pick this place. I cannot say enough and they were extremely accommodating.  I took my girlfriend here for a weekend (Fri - Sun) for a combo birthday + Christmas gift and everything went perfect. They had the room set up with rose pedals when we walked in the first time; then I asked if they could set up champagne and chocolate covered strawberries when we went out for dinner.  When we got back for dinner the champagne; strawberries; and candles we all set up perfectly! My girlfriend was very surprised. Then they helped me schedule a couples massage that evening; which was another surprise. So the first afternoon / evening there was absolutely perfect.  The vibe of this inn is very boutique; quaint; and charming. Perfect for couples. We could also use the bikes daily (for free); which we did. They gave us great suggestions on where to go and what to do. Both State Street; the beach; and the train station are all walking distance.   I'd say my girlfriend had a great experience for her first stop in Santa Barbara because this place made such a nice impression. [REVIEW_9] A great place! Friendly staff; great serive and solid food at reasonable prices. A great trifecta! [REVIEW_10] Absolutely wonderful food & service! Go there for lunch/dinner with my boyfriend at least once every two weeks. Prices are very much reasonable. Weekends get pretty packed so may have to wait a little bit but that's never an issue for us. Always get the Indian Pancake & the Hainanese Chicken or Curry Chicken. Other dishes are delicious as well. Never get tired of it! [REVIEW_11] There are lots of asian/ Chinese places to get decent food in the area. But only one where you can have a beautiful sit down fine dining experience. That is Veekoo. The food is superb; and the wait staff alway attentive. The place has an upscale feel to it; but without the upscale pricing. It is the perfect place to take your family for a nice dinner out. [REVIEW_12] Delicious! Had starters of prawns in a spicy sauce and cauliflower florets in a tangy  glaze. Entrees were chicken korama; vindaloo; and xacuti. Also had garlic naan.   All delicious!!! [REVIEW_13] Courteous; funny; and creative workers who do an exemplary job.  Installed and wired a window AC; ceiling fan on a high vaulted ceiling; and a dedicated circuit for my high end audio system.  Regarding price... Quality work and service is what you get.  I'd rather have it done right the first time and pay a little more.  If you want people who show up on time; do the job without taking short cuts; and use quality parts; these are the guys; period. [REVIEW_14] We actually come here often for different products; however this place needs a lot of work or different management. The management hides in the little office and never comes out to help regardless of people needing help. They need several more employees and I've sent several of my students from UNR needing part time orfull time but the hiring process is so crazy nobody's interested! Lastly most bathrooms at the gas stations are cleaner than this bathroom. It's crazy filthy. And this is supposed to be kind of a professional place. We've been coming here for a long time and these observations are over a period of consistent observation. I just finally decided to write a review. I think we will switch to the mud town location. [REVIEW_15] So glad to have a great vietnamese place uptown! The spring rolls were authentic and the peanut sauce was great. I had the meatball pho and thought the broth was aromatic and very tasty. Furthermore; they have a stocked bar and are open on Sundays which; as many vietnamese food lovers know; is quite rare.   Will definitely be going back soon! [REVIEW_16] We're moving out of Indy in 2 days and Revolucion was a must-try before departing. It was nothing short of phenomenal! Loved the casual; order at the bar environment and simple menu. We had the chips with salsa and guacamole - awesome - and the fish; pork; shrimp; and beef tacos. Yes; they were so good; my husband ate five. Pork and shrimp were our faves but they were all so good it was hard to decide what we liked best. Give this place your business! [REVIEW_17] First time visit the other day; amazing!!!! Best hot chicken anywhere!!! Will def be a must stop every time we come to Nashville!!! [REVIEW_18] Over priced.  Over rated.  Totally disappointing.  No jelly donuts.  How can any self respecting donut place not have a jelly donut? Luckily the coffee was decent. [REVIEW_19] I signed up for YELP just so that I could tell people about this restaurant.  It was excellent!    We went for Valentine's day and I was surprised to get a last minute reservation.      We shared an appitizer (Wurzfleish-wonderful) and a salad.   For an entree I ordered the Schnitzel; couldn't decide on the sauce so she brought me both!  My wife ordered the Krustenbraten which is a slow roasted crispy pork with an amazing flavor!    Of course the on-tap beer is amazing!   We found Brummis' to be very friendly; the food was top quality and the price was very reasonable.    About $65 for what we ordered which included two beers. [REVIEW_20] RUDE RUDE RUDE; couldn't be bothered by myself or my friend and the small basic tattoo we wanted. Over priced the tattoo and and had the worst attitude ever. Big disappointment and let down for us. Dustin should get his head out of the clouds and come back down to earth with his holier than thou attitude",13
34,"[REVIEW_1] Crash is an excellent guy!  This place has a nice and relaxed feel to it.  I would recommend them to anyone.  Excellent service overall. [REVIEW_2] Great experience!  This place has an awesome authentic atmosphere; great food; and friendly staff.  I am excited to go there when the weather is nice and they have the garage door open so you can eat in the open air right on Broad St.    We tried the Al Pastor burrito bowl and tacos.  Both had great flavor; and tasted very authentic.  Portion size on the burrito bowl was great; tacos are on the smaller side.  The owner was very friendly and seems to really care about ensuring everyone has a good experience.  My only recommendation would be that since its 3 tacos for $9; it would be cool to be able to add a 4th or maybe 5th taco for a discounted price for people who have big appetites.    Overall; I would give this place 5 stars for great tasting food; extremely friendly staff; and fun/chill environment.  It is a great addition to South Broad Street in Center City! [REVIEW_3] Busy but quick and fast service with deliciously thick custard.  I had the turtle and it was everything I thought it would be; sweet; smooth with a bit of crunch.  This place is a St. Louis staple. [REVIEW_4] my favorite pizza place in the area . friendly staff and the biggest slices of pizza anywhere . For 4.50 you can get any one of up to 10 different gourmet slices . the margherita and the buffalo chicken are not to be missed . great outdoor dining area I frequently ride my bicycle there have a slice and Ride it off home. nice small dining room in the back . [REVIEW_5] As someone from out of town; all I could look forward to was the food. And let me tell you it was a disappointment. I read many good reviews about this establishment. If I could give them no stars I would. Could not run out of there fast enough. Their half peeled shrimp was literal mush. They had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. The shrimp peel was brown; they were probably cooked about a month ago; put in a freezer and served them to me as they thawed. Their jambalaya was further than the truth. It was pasta in tomato sauce with a minuscule piece of chicken. And the fact that I had to pay as I left was bewildering. Not even their mediocre waiters could save; what I would call; the worst dining experience of my life. The only thing that made it worthwhile was when the hostess removed the atrocity that was my dinner and asked ""they nasty?"" [REVIEW_6] Been coming to Spice n Grill since 2012; we were fortunate to live in University city so was quick and easy to get here; now we live in Creve Coeur and I will most certainly make the drive back as have now tried numerous different Indian takeaways and this still comes out Trumps.  Takeaway is always neat and clean; and the owner is always smiling and very friendly and always willing to explain any questions I have about the menu.  We have tried the chicken curry; chicken vindaloo; and goat Karahi and everything is always well cooked and perfectly spiced.  The goat here is the best I have had as every piece is always soft and tender and the sauce is amazing. And the rice is always hot and fluffy  Only negative I have to comment on; is the portion sizes are defintely getting smaller; i would like to see the bigger portion sizes that used to be served in 2012 [REVIEW_7] The older lady may not be ready to work as a cashier. Her position should be changed temporarily to something even more basic (i.e. cleaning?) until some form of customer service training is provided.  Another reviewer called her miserable; but it may simply be lack of training or being put in a position that is too difficult for her. Maybe she can 'shadow' one of the much younger employees to learn skills needed to be a cashier? [REVIEW_8] I was very pleased with my Mac & Cheesy.  In and out pretty quick; friendly service.  I noticed a couple of draft selections but had mine to go. [REVIEW_9] Always enjoy our routine visits here!  Even with the infamous ""nacho chicken wing"" situation; we always spend alot of our Nashville time here!! [REVIEW_10] I have to say the one thing about Joeybs that you get is great consistency from the food to the wonderful staff. There is something for every taste bud and excellent portions. And it has a lot of TVs. [REVIEW_11] This is hands down the best place to get gourmet coffee that isn't overpriced! It's cheaper if you drink your coffee there [versus getting it to go] and trust me; you'll want to stay unless you're in a hurry. The cafe itself is pretty big and has 2 areas that are separated by the counter/kitchen. They also have a bar (hence the name) and a food menu. Their desserts are generously proportioned and there's a wide selection to choose from. My friend and I tried the oversized snickerdoodle cookie; which was pretty decent for a standard cookie- soft and chewy and not overly sweet. The staff was very friendly and flexible. Definitely a place I'll have to come back to. [REVIEW_12] Words can not express how happy I am and how wonderful my wedding day was with the flowers these ladies put together for my wedding. They took what I was dreaming of having on my special day and made it a reality. Me and my husband could not be happier. I know who I'll be hinting him to buy flowers for me from in the future. [REVIEW_13] YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY! This place is by far one of the best sushi restaurants I've ever been to; and I have been eating sushi since I was a little girl. Each meal was flavorful and delicious! From the miso soup to the two rolls my sister and I shared! Great service (Danelo); great food; and fast cooking! So thankful we decided to try this place out! Will be back [REVIEW_14] Tried this place the other day the pizza was not very good at all the place before this one was so much better all home made food with it would've stuck around [REVIEW_15] This place is phenomenal. The food is ON point!! The chefs are total artists and it's beautiful to watch. Had the ahi poke and spicy chicken ramen. Can't wait to go back!!! [REVIEW_16] This place is great!  Customer service: The man I spoke to on the phone was polite and helpful and the delivery was fast. 5/5  Food: I ordered Eggplant Parmesan; Lemon Chicken soup; Baklava; and a soda. Everything was delicious! No complaints whatsoever. 5/5  Price: Very affordable! If you order delivery before 4PM there is no minimum for your delivery order; and no extra delivery charge. 5/5  Really impressed with this place. I can't wait to try all the other food on the menu! [REVIEW_17] Growing up I lived right by Donut Drive-in.  We'd go every week after church and my sister and I would fight over the sprinkle donuts or the blueberry iced donuts.  Having moved back to St. Louis recently I forgot all about this place until one day my husband said ""Wow; that place looks old"" and I said ""We'll go there some weekend"" ---it took a few weeks but finally we were in the area so I got a dozen donuts for breakfast--HEAVEN!  I went in and picked out the donuts and it was like my entire youth flooding back--they haven't changed a bit which is comforting and also it makes sense--if it ain't broke; don't fix it!  My personal favorite is the french cruller with chocolate icing.  Tastes just like I remember although the custard with powdered sugar is a close second.    It was packed when I went inside but it took no time at all to get my box o' donuts.  Donut drive-in; don't ever change! [REVIEW_18] I love this place! A group of friends and I were looking for a late night place to grab something sweet and some locals recommended this place. After a trolley ride and wandering around; we finally made it. The environment is really comfortable with pictures of patrons on the bright walls. What makes this place special is the homemade and unique ice creams. If you can't decide; they will let you sample a bunch of flavors. You can even get half scoops. I came back several times during my stay in NOLA!  Here's the flavors I got: -lavender honey (my fav) -red velvet -chocolate amaretto cheesecake -almond toffee  Highly recommended! [REVIEW_19] Very great. The owner came and spoke with us. That is always a good sign. The waiter was great and the food outstanding. [REVIEW_20] Known for their enormous salads and toasted sandwiches; my favorite is the California style pizzas.   I tend to always go back to the Deborah Pizza.  It's a pesto style with roasted onions and chicken.  I have them leave off the tomatoes because it makes it too watery.   The indulgent every so often choice is the Pimento Cheese pizza.  This is greasy; so blot the pie with a few napkins and double up on the Lipotor and enjoy.   I became a member of their Roundtable elite which is a email list that sends you specials and new menu items.   On a stalker note; there are loads of ""Nashville"" cast stars eating there all the time.",17
35,"[REVIEW_1] Was not impressed at all. We were going to eat st IHOP but since the wait time was way too long for three kids we walked over to 5 guys. First off the prices are nuts ...a burger was like 6.99 and comes with no fries so I thought well maybe it's a big burger. Nope a regular Mcdonalds size burger. The fries were loaded down with salt...it felt like I was eating a pound of salt. Then I ordered the veggie sandwich. I'm thinking I'm getting a veggie burger nope it's just onions peppers mushroom on a bun. Super disgusting! It was almost $50 for us to eat at a fast food joint and the food was gross!  I could have went to Mcdonalds and had dessert lunch and breakfast for that price and had a better meal. My husband used to work at a 5 guys in SC and as I remember the fries came with the burger as a meal fresh in a bag and the burgers were huge! We had to take half of it home.  I would not recommend this place at all especially if your on a budget. [REVIEW_2] I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. Their biggest mistake is not having a customer service department. They rely on their sales team to provide customer service meaning every time you call in to try and get something done; you get put into a voicemail because the sales guy is out selling - which should be their only job. This left me on numerous occassions incredibly frustrated that I could not get an answer. I even left the manager a voicemail (big surprise I couldn't get them to answer) and they never had the decency to call me back - Just made my sales person call me back.  I purchased my car last July and was promised numerous things would be done to the car before I purchased it. One of which being the tint on the rear window would be removed as the view out of the back was blurry. Somehow; that passed thru inspection and when I came to sign the papers; I noticed that it was still on the back windshield. I was told that they would have it removed by the time we were done the paperwork. Also; I was told that the price was going to be higher than the original agreement because the sales manager did the math wrong the previous day when we ran numbers. I told him that wasn't my fault and I would only pay the agreed upon amount and he spoke with the manager and got it sorted out.   After sitting in the office for 2.5 hours; they finally told me that they were unable to even start taking off the tint and I would have to bring the car back. I dropped it off that Friday and let them keep it for the weekend. My sales guy called me on Saturday night to tell me that they never got to finish it and I would have to bring it back again and leave it. I live 45 minutes from the dealership so this isn't something I can easily do. I insisted on them giving me a loaner car for whatever day they would do this as I was sure this wouldn't be a one day process from my previous experience. 2.5 weeks later they were able to provide me with said car and I dropped off my vehicle. When I went to pick up my ""finished car"" there was still tint left on the bottom of the windshield.   After all of that I knew I would never bring my car back for service there if that's the kind of service they provide. Now with all the rain we've been having; my trunk is leaking and when I called to check with the service department to see if it would be covered under warranty; I got the same run around with the service department who just said ""I don't know"" - OK well give me someone who will be able to tell me. Once they forwarded me to the correct person; I again got ""I don't know"". We need you to bring it in and look at it then submit to our warranty company to see if it gets accepted. No thanks after my previous experience of bringing my car in there to get ""serviced"".   Invest in a customer service department to handle complaints in a professional and timely matter. This should not in any way be left upon the sales department to do. My sales guy did the best he could and I appreciated the help he gave me; but no one else would help me throughout the entire process. Not a good look on managements part. [REVIEW_3] Okay lets start from the beginning.  1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me ""Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card"". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in. So strike 1 is the rude staff in a ""MAJOR"" hotel!  2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor).  So Strike 2 is in a ""MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!  3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower.  So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a ""MAJOR"" hotel!  4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a ""MAJOR"" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot. So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a ""MAJOR"" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.  5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!! Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!  6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door. Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.  All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!! [REVIEW_4] A great lunch or dinner stop in Reno; NV.    We've had some fine meals in this establishment......Tyler (manager) does a great job with his staff; and it shows in the overall results.  They are also a pub; so its got a great selection of beers and wines too! [REVIEW_5] This restaurant is seriously lacking in customer service!  We have dined many times at Dish.  We like the food.  We made a reservation two weeks ahead for 3 people.  When we arrived we were seated at the smallest table in the restaurant which barely fits two people.  The table next to us had an extra person added at the end; his back was literally a couple of inches from our table.  We asked for a table that would accomdate three people and not involve eating with someone's large back at our very tiny table.  We were rudely informed that it was a take or leave it situation.  It was very frustrating since we booked this as a special night out weeks earlier.  Unfortunately; we are writing this restraurant off our list. [REVIEW_6] Echoing everyone else's frustration about Philly's 2013 ""race"" - expensive parking; storm came; chaos ensued and we never got refunds! It was actually a dangerous situation; with thousands of people running around a park at night in thunder and lightening; and they never came back to Philly... [REVIEW_7] Try the Green Bloody Mary!  Creative twist on a classic. Got a delayed kick; but it's a good one. [REVIEW_8] We never got the oysters that we ordered before our entrees. When our entrees came they were far too salty to eat. As former residents of Belgium we were not impressed at all with the food. We were offered dessert to apologize for the oysters but honestly with so many other restaurant options in NOLA we still will not be back.  The cocktails; however; were good so maybe happy hour would be decent but again; I unfortunately can't comment on the oysters. [REVIEW_9] Disappointing experience. Pastries (had the croissant; eclair; cannoli) are okay but nothing amazing. Dining area is small. Very limited drink options. I agree with previous reviews that it is very reminiscent of break-room coffee with 2 pump pots full of coffee and buy-in-bulk tea bags.    Really what soured the experience was the counter staff.  After my SO and I purchased several pastries; coffee; tea and went to sit down; the staff informed us that we couldn't stay because they were closing. The sign says 5pm; this was at 4pm.  She assured us that it was just that day they were closing early.   No apology. Just informed us and walked away. After all this; I had to remind her that I was still waiting for a cup of hot water to steep my warehouse earl grey tea in. We came to the cafe to sit and enjoy tea and pastries so it was obviously a disappointment to get kicked out before the advertised closing time.  I would have greatly appreciated being informed of the earlier hours prior to making a purchase or at least in the form of a sign. Would much rather enjoy a pre-made croissant and better drink options at the adjacent Starbucks or PJs. Lesson learned. [REVIEW_10] Great food. Great atmosphere. The decor is really nice. Modern and cozy. I had lasagna and it was one of the best lasagna I've ever had. Hubby had risotto loved it as well. Service was good. [REVIEW_11] We have been going to this restaurant for about 2 years. We were regulars until now; but after what happened tonight we will never go back. We noticed that our bill was alot more than it usually would be. So we added up the price of each dish and discovered after calling the owner that she added a 20% tip to the bill without our consent. (on top of our own separate tip) We also ordered 4 dishes and were given enough rice for only 2. So we requested more rice and she charged us another $4. To rip us off even more she taxed us on the total bill gratuity included. We confronted her about this and there was no remorse only made up lies about these charges. You dont treat regular customers like this...sorry lady! [REVIEW_12] Thank goodness for yelp because we would've never found this place without it. It's a little hole in the wall place very charming. We happened to come on happy hour which was a great bargain we had two drinks and dinner for a little over $20 Great guacamole and simple tacos were just what we needed. Shinon the bartender was helpful and accommodating. [REVIEW_13] Just left Reeds. It was one of the best meals I have had.  I had the pork cheek which I have never had before but it was wonderful. The pork belly was very good.  The wine was excellent.  The atmosphere was very comfortable. Pork loin was just as good.  The mixed drinks were excellent.  I will return. [REVIEW_14] Paid for Deluxe Services almost 2 months prior to the event and only received a basic package at best. Attempts to resolve the issue with Keith have been returned with defensive dialogue; accusatory statements and untruths. His unprofessional approach has escalated this situation to the point of being settled in court. I have never been treated so poorly by a vendor. [REVIEW_15] This place completely exceeded my expectations; and I had a great experience. The space and equipment were very clean; the therapist was strong and responsive; and pricing schedule is very fair- the best deal in town for trained massage. Also; I was a walk-in and they saw me in less than 5 minutes. [REVIEW_16] Do not go here ever again. I've been ordering here for seven years and tonight I ordered the usual for the family and it was horrible.  They couldn't even get the burger right. We ordered four combos; three with onion rings rings and one with fries. They put the one onion ring on the burger and they gave us all fries and screwed up the donair's. we called and complained about the order and they said we will remake it free of charge.  But they still screwed it up!  The doanir's came with lettuce and a dusting of donair meat. We asked for extra sweet sauce and we still had to look for any sauce at all!  The place is under new ownership and clearly they do not know what they are doing!  They couldn't even get the pop order correctly!  It was painful!! [REVIEW_17] Took forever to deliver and I am just blocks away. They claim one driver had ten orders to deliver; ridiculous! After the almost two hour wait; WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!! Just the weirdest shrimp scampi I have ever had. They tried to do too much with it. The only good thing was the sweet potato cheesecake. I would give the cheesecake five stars and that's the only thing I would ever get from here again! [REVIEW_18] Would give no stars;  called for a cab and it was a  no show.  Terrible service;  when I tried to call and cancel service  all I got was a message telling me that lines were busy.  Least 5 of their cabs drove by where I was waiting;  and none stopped.  Luckily I found me another way to my destination.  Will NEVER  use this company again.!!!! [REVIEW_19] If I could give negative stars I would. Terrible service. No one acknowledged me for over 10 minutes and that's only because I was leaving. The other customers told me don't bother ordering because I've been waiting over 30 minutes. [REVIEW_20] The best Chinese food in Phoenixville. The food is delicious and the restaurant is clean. The owners and their daughters add even more charm to the dining experience. My family loves this place.",7
36,"[REVIEW_1] Unprofessional manager; that manager I spoke to was not listening to me at all.  He would talk as fast as he could and would not let me say what I call for; every time I say something he would start talking and keep talking just running all over my words; neither of us listening to each other; only escalated voice tones. It was not worth the 10% which was about $20.00; I would save by using my government issued veterans id card but because of some verbiage that was not on the ID; Home Depot decline the discount.  The cashier interrogated me took my ID looked at it then at me and said I could not use the Id; I never had a problem before.  She stop talking and stood there waiting for my money.  The manager did not want to hear me out and the check out person were  both very disrespectful and rude. [REVIEW_2] Joe's is the place for great seafood! Service was fast and friendly! Clam chowder was great and of course the crab is always amazing! Eat at Joe's!! Love this place! [REVIEW_3] Love this little park! Beautiful landscape; sights and sounds. It's perfect for watching the sunset over the Mississippi River and also perfect for a run.  There are 3 entrances to this 1.2 mile stretch snd easy parking available at 2 of the lots.  This is my new favorite spot in the City! [REVIEW_4] i found this by accident  was hungry at work and tried this place on uber eats and i was impressed food was good the salmon was on point seasoned just rite mac and cheese was on point well worth the 5 stars this is a must try [REVIEW_5] You can't get this quality of BBQ anywhere in the area! Hickory Kitchen is a quaint little BYOB BBQ restaurant right in the center of Doylestown! I highly recommend it! [REVIEW_6] Awesome sushi! We've been looking for the best sushi around the area for a long time and finally we found it! We were impressed with everything. One thing better than the other one. We got the Jalapeño popper; Suno Mono; Spicy Kani salad; Samurai roll; Masami roll and deep fried banana for dessert. [REVIEW_7] They moved to 1515 DeKalb. The office is GORGEOUS! They have heated massage dental chairs and tvs on the ceiling. Love it! Staff is awesome! [REVIEW_8] Great setting. Food & service did not match the hip bar/restaurant. My friends and I (6 people) had a reservation for brunch on Sunday. We were the only table there and the bar was less than full. It took a very long time to get our drinks. Our server was not attentive. We weren't going to get our bottomless mimosas waiting around for her bc she was sitting & rolling silverware chatting it up with her co-worker. So I took our glasses directly to the  bartender for our refills instead. Food was mediocre at best. I ordered the hot chicken tacos which wasn't spicy at all. My friends ordered the lox; it was fishy and it was more like smoked salmon flakes; no actual slices of smoked salmon. Pricey for what it was. The steak my friend ordered was very salty. A very bad representation of Nashville eateries. I do not recommend going here. [REVIEW_9] Food is overpriced and mediocre. For the same price we could have gone to Commander's or Brennan's and could have got amazing food for the same price. Food here is beyond average. [REVIEW_10] Very disappointed :( We came first thing in the morning; but we're rushed through because a group had appointments an HOUR later. The girl didn't clean out my toes; skipped my cuticles; and proceeded to BURN me with her callous sander. For four days I've been walking around with sander induced Blisters and they hurt like heck! She put two coats on my big toe and one on the other toes. The decor is nice; but the staff is unprofessional and need to be trained how to do nails without rushing. You won't get return customers with this level of service. [REVIEW_11] Terrible Service! I went there with a co worker around 5pm to get drinks using a giftcard I got from RiteAid.com. I've been there a couple times because their chicken fingers are delicious! When I got there; I told the bartender that I had 2 /$10 coupons(only because it didnt allow me to buy $20); she said I could only use one coupon per month. So I said 'okay well then we'll just be getting some drinks.'  She never said anyrhing else. So when we get the bill; the owner came over and told me to never come back!! All because we didnt order food and he thought I was scamming him!! (If she said we had to buy food then we would have) Then said shouted that doesn't support alcoholism! (But owns a bar) I can't believe because I had 3 beers after work on a Monday; I'm considered an alcoholic! The bill was about $18 and I was going to give a good tip but.... I'm never going back. Just like another review I saw for this place- ""These people judge a book by its cover."" If you don't want people to use the coupons!! don't offer to be on the website!!. It's simple. Such bad business! [REVIEW_12] I moved up here from Houston ;and like most Texans; I  was skeptical about finding a place that could capture my love of all things Tequila; Tacos; and live music. Well I have to tell you Cervesa Jack's made a Texas boy feel at home! Amazing Tacos and Robbie is a true mixologist as well as social bartender. Their Tequila Exchange is a fun and gets customers excited to try drinks for the right price! I love this place! [REVIEW_13] Obsessed. I was in SB for my wedding and we randomly stumbled upon Dawn Patrol. I got the hash with yukon potatoes; chicken; egg whites; veggies; and hollandaise sauce; in addition to an iced coffee. It was hearty; fresh; and healthy; which is exactly what I was looking for. I loved it so much that I brought my new husband there the morning after our wedding. If I lived in SB; I'd be a regular. [REVIEW_14] Merritt A. saved the day for us!  Earlier in the day; we had someone who ""attempted"" to change out two toilet flanges and flush handles.  This inept person botched the job terribly!  He started leaks; when there were no leaks. When he finally left; we immediate called Lee Company.  They sent out Merritt right away.  Merritt fixed the problems on both toilets right away.  No more leaks; no more problems!  He fixed the nightmare this other private individual created.  Thank you; Merritt!  Call Lee Company - they are true professionals! [REVIEW_15] Been waiting for a delivery of a new refrigerator; called store to try and get a time frame; was told that they can't give me any information I need to call the delivery guy; what kind of business runs like that; can't figure out how they have been in business for so long; I should of went to lowe's at least I would have some idea when my purchase would get here. [REVIEW_16] Morgan and Stayci not only have very warm and gentle personalities; the environment of the salon is lighthearted and relaxed for your pet to spend an hour getting fed a few treats; being loved while getting a sharp; stylish; functional cut. They are the most wonderful women and my puppy loves how he looks when he leaves...I'm never taking my baby anywhere else! [REVIEW_17] Great lunch!!  We saw all the people eating here so we decided it must be a good place to go!! The food was amazing !! We took other's advice and tried it all!! Mac and cheese was great so was the banana pudding.  I had the Chilean sandwich and would skip the bun and the slaw next time. The French fries were amazing !! [REVIEW_18] Absolutely terrible experience. I accidentally booked a wrong night through this hotel and when I called to see if I could a refund and change it they would not allow me. It was a simple mistake and I wanted to change it to another date and they still would not let me do so. Terrible customer experience. I will not be booking with a complete different hotel. [REVIEW_19] The plan was to find a one-of-a-kind engagement ring. I had no prior history or knowledge of jewelry; especially not engagement rings. Foolishly I visited a handful of those cookie cutter mall shops. Boring. Pricey. Nothing special. Blah.  A co-worker told me about Gemological Resources Inc (GRI) and the wonderful experience he and his now wife had with them. Since it was a local shop I gave them a shot not knowing what to expect. Wow.... What a great experience!   From the moment we (my girlfriend and I) walked into GRI; it felt right. We met with Terry initially to get a feel for GRI's work; as well as to discuss ring options.Terry is an encyclopedia of knowledge; it was a true lesson on everything we needed to know about diamonds; rings; etc. Very much worth taking the time to meet with him. He not only shared much of his knowledge; but also listened and got a good feel for what my girlfriend liked. The initial meet was a success and I felt confident that GRI would be the right place to go once I was ready to make the decisive move solo.  When the time came I met up with GRI again; this time with Nirali who works closely with Terry. Because I wanted a unique; special; one-of-a-kind engagement ring I decided on a custom design ring. The CAD images and designs were perfect! To top it off; Nirali found me a high quality and very well priced diamond; this after I spent weeks personally searching for the right diamond. I was sold!!   A reasonable deposit and a couple of weeks later the ring was finally in. Wow oh wow!! It was perfect! 100X better than anything I've seen before. GRI knocked it out of the park! Seriously! Fast forward a few months later.... My wife loves her ring and goes goo goo over it everyday. We had our bands done by GRI as well and they too are perfect (the wife's band was also custom designed to match the engagement ring).  All in all it was a GREAT outcome. We are both so very pleased and happy about our experience with GRI. Beyond our expectations. Never have I had such a relaxing and pleasant experience. I truly mean it. It always felt like I was meeting with friends and not just a standard business transaction.   So do yourself a favor... If you're reading this it's because you're thinking about buying jewelry. Save yourself the hassle. GO DIRECTLY TO GRI. I highly recommend them. [REVIEW_20] Well. It used to be great. But The service has changed.  The last two times we ate there; service was not good at all.  Undercooked fish.  Watery macaroni. Cold onion rings.  Very disappointing.  We stayed away for a few months then tried again.  This time service was poor; prices raised; and smaller portions.  Sorry top hog.  That's it for our group.  Won't be back.",12
37,"[REVIEW_1] Food was not well seasoned. They said they were understaffed and there was staff sitting in the dining room on laptops. The salsa was very bland. Had the enchiladas supremas and was very disappointed. [REVIEW_2] In NO on business; and always try to eat where the locals do; or at least avoid the chains. This place came highly recommended. I was all set for a great breakfast; and was so disappointed. Took 30 minutes to get food; which was overcooked after sitting under heat lamps. Totally uninterested and full of attitude service. They were busy; so may have something to do with it; but I won't be back. [REVIEW_3] My experience at Tennessee Brew Works was noteworthy! I tried the beer flight so that I could sample all the yummy brews they have to offer. I really enjoyed them all but my favorite was their Witt! We sat outside on their patio on a sunny day. The atmosphere was super relaxed- it really made for the perfect afternoon. The live music was also a huge plus.  We didn't sample their food this time; but it looked SO delicious; and will definitely try it next time. I highly recommend Tennessee Brew Works for a fun afternoon with friends or family! I'm already looking for an opportunity to go back. [REVIEW_4] Do not eat here! I ordered general tso tofu and asked for it to be extra crispy with light sauce. Not only did it come out FULL of sauce; but they refused to replace it and only offered to drain the extra sauce. Needless to say; it was bland and soggy. Never again. [REVIEW_5] My acrylic nails are lovely with gel ..without oiling my cuticles..grrr .. bit pricey..  However the pedicure was the worst ; very fast and a sloppy foot massage .. [REVIEW_6] Worst service ever. We were really excited to try this place out as everyone raves so much about it. My sister lives here and while I was visiting; we decided to try it. We waited in line for about 30 minutes (I understand this is popular; so it's fine). We waited for a long time while we were seated waiting dor our food while everyone around us (who came AFTER US) had been served. Food isn't as expected; quality sucked for what you wait for. IHOP is WAY BETTER. Don't waste your time; we complained to the manager and all we got was ""I'm sorry""; no actions were taken on the management side. Disappointed; will NEVER come here and not recommended. [REVIEW_7] This place is where the former Pollo Loco used to be next to the launder-mat. I'm always in search of the best breakfast burrito and this place has it. Delicious homemade flour tortillas made daily along with a fresh salsa bar with 4 different salsas to choose from. They offer daily specials too! I'll definitely be back for lunch & dinner. [REVIEW_8] If you are into mediterranean food this the place. Fresh and super tasty. Very nice service as well. Highly recommended. [REVIEW_9] Oh my gosh! This place probably had some of THE best chinses food I have ever consumed. Upon visitng Philadelphia; my boyfriend and I decided to wander around Chinatown. Based on some of the reviews on here; I suggested we try Empress Garden for a late lunch. We were glad we did! We ordered the ""Family Dinner for 2"" with Hot and Sour soup; Sweet and Sour Chicken and Veggie Lo Mein. I am not a huge fan of Hot and Sour soup but my boyfriend is and he is very picky about it; but he loved it here! Even finished my bowl as well. The sweet and sour chicken was soooo good. Best I have ever had. It came with the sauce already on it and it was still nice and crispy. The lo mein was also above par and although we were too stuffed to finish it; the waitress gladly packed it up to go and we had a little snack for back at our hotel. If I am ever in Philly again; I will definitely be back to visit this restaurant. [REVIEW_10] As a new Englander I have experience with many Dunkins and this is by far the worst I have EVER been to and I have been to a lot.   Some highlights include: - milk/ cream that tastes sour - red hair in my drink - overall unsanitary - debatably some of the rudest customer service   I tell my friends that this isn't what Dunkins is about who don't have many where they are from. Unfortunately this a sad excuse for a franchise [REVIEW_11] Excellent brisket sandwich! Options of pickles and coleslaw as well. A variety of sauces for your sandwich! Funny and nice guys working there! [REVIEW_12] Stumbled upon this place while visiting from TX. Small selection but VERY good! So fresh; organic; and absolutely delicious!  Yummy cheese quesadillas for the kids and the tuna & chicken salad is extra tasty! The owner/chef was super friendly and polite.  Definite A+ for fabulous customer service! Great quiet; clean place to catch a healthy bite to eat!! [REVIEW_13] Wish I would have came on Yelp and read the previous reviews; it would've saved me a lot of time and frustration. I ran in today to see if someone could take a look at my right passenger front wheel. My tire pressure light was on and I noticed a piece of tire was lifted. I go in and he tells me it's a couple hours wait. Ok; I'll give you that I just showed up so the wait thing is to be expected. I ask the guy if I can make an appointment to come back. He says its first come first serve. Really? When I've made appts previously with other Just Tires? Why not just say you don't want my service? Bottom line? Guy was rude and lacked any customer service. Went down the street to Mr. Tire and was in and out with a replaced new tire in half an hour. Oh; and they appeared WAY busier based on the waiting area and cars in the garage. [REVIEW_14] My wife purchased a 90 min massage from Groupon as I was having major shoulder pain. This was the first time ever having a professional massage and I was happy to get this done here at Liferoot. Nate was able to relieve the pain in my shoulder and I am now back to my regular workout routine. [REVIEW_15] First off the bathroom smell like dirty seafood which almost took away my appetite to start with we order the king crab and lobster tacos there was hardly any meat in the king crab and considering that it was more expensive than the 3 pounds of a different kind of crab you would think that there would've been plenty of meat My lobster tacos was over an under cooked but the next two days hunched over the toilet so disappointed [REVIEW_16] Rude employees. Suggested I was lying about trying to place an online order online with cash as an option. I could not use cash as the option as a ""guest"" and I did not want to create an account as I usually use much higher quality pizzerias when I am looking for a pie. I understand this is just a chain store but as a costumer you still expect to not be treated rudely. [REVIEW_17] These people are so RUDE! I will never go there again! They are not helpful and act as though they are too good to help amateur photographers like me! It will be a cold day in hell before they get another dime from me. They need to remember that they are sales clerks and their role is to help the customer! What a bunch of IDIOTS! [REVIEW_18] Excellent! Love the location-- fun upscale decor. Service was perfect-- knowledgeable; respectful; and fun. I'm sure this place will end up busy and packed; but for now; it feels like a secret I want to keep! We ordered small plates-- flatbread pizza; butternut squash soup; and house salads. Dinner was filet medallions; salmon; burger and tuna poke. Everyone loved their meals and drinks. We will be back soon! [REVIEW_19] Stopped in here with my wife and a friend for lunch today. And let me tell you it will probably be the last time I visit this location.  I normally love QDOBA but this location down right sucks. From the ride ass customer service to the cleanliness it's just all around terrible. I've never had a person whistle at me from behind a ""line"" and say ""excuse me what would you like to eat"". You're kidding me right?  And plus look at my pics; this chick had her hair dangling down in front of her face and swaying back in forth and prepping food. ARE YOU SERIOUS? What happened to having it covered up? I won't be back to this location; to easy to get sick or catch something. [REVIEW_20] Hard to find a sushi spot with good quality ingredients. Service was amazing as well. The waiter accidentally forgot to take one of our orders and later gave us complementary dessert to make up for it! Got the Fishtown roll; dynamite white tuna; and green tea cake with chocolate ubé ice cream.",9
38,"[REVIEW_1] I went to Jin after finding her good reviews on Yelp to alter my wedding dress. First time I want to alter my zipper so it works better and widen my arm holes. Job was done; I did not see much of difference; zipper was still not working well and the arm holes were still tight but little better. Second time I went to Jin to alter the bottom part of my wedding dress. It was ""puffy"" and I want to remove some material from it so it would be more flat. Jin agreed and she was very nice. She made very good impression on me although sometimes it was not so easy to understand her. Which we talked about and I understand since English is not my first language either. I came for first fitting and we both agreed on material to be removed. Jin quoted me final price. She kept saying it is so much work; so much work. That was little annoying already cause at the end of the day I was willing to pay as much as quoted for it and I was not happy with her saying that dress is fine. If I am not happy with it; it is not fine. I came for ""final fitting"" and I was not happy. In my opinion not enough material was removed and Jin agreed it was her mistake so she would fix it. The last time I came was yesterday. I thought it was only for fitting so I did not bring money for payment. The dress was ready. I looked at it and my heart dropped. The front of dress had one quarter size BLOOD stain and one 5 times bigger BLOOD smudge right in front of my WHITE WEDDING DRESS. I am sure any women can emphasized with terror I felt. First Jin said she does not know what it is. Then she admitted it is blood and it happens all the time (!). No apologies. She came with Hydrogen Peroxide and cleaned the stains.... Now my dress smells great. She said it is fine cause I need to dry clean it either way cause she did not keep dress in garment bag and it is all dusty at the bottom! I got super upset cause dress was clean and ready to be wear on my wedding day that is next week! Anyway I just took dress and went to try it on. She kept saying it was so much work and it took her long and I understood that and I was ready to give her extra tip. But I was not saying anything cause 1) I was trying on the dress and 2) I was still so angry and not in mood for small talk. I came out; dress was ok. Jin was getting more and more angry cause she saw I was not too responsive. She told me she will never do this job again; it is not worth it; and no money from it; so long work. I understand all that but she quoted my price and she made a mistake. She knew what has to be done and she agreed to it. I do not understand why I have to be responsible here. The worst part was the end of visit when and sooooo uncalled for; she got so angry she started yelling at me cause I was still not happy about the stains. And she said she has no money from it and she will not pay for the stains she made. This was so disrespectful and not necessary. I decided instead of picking up dress today I would go back home for my wallet and just get it over with. She was still yelling when I left. I cried on my way home; my fiancé went back with me cause I was so shaken. He was waiting outside (I did not want him to see dress). She was again rude and disrespectful; yelled so much I could not say word in between. I just asked her to please count the money cause I want to leave. She took money and I left.  I normally never add reviews with unpleasant experience cause I do not want to be reason of anyone losing business but I never was treated so disrespectfully in my life. I do not recommend this place. Yes it is cheap but your garments are not treated with care and you may ended up paying more at the end.  I wish I could give 0 stars. [REVIEW_2] Nice to receive a message from Kerry @ the Whole Foods team. Promised to send a gift card due to the bad sausage. Never received. Guess she is just a person who pretends they care. [REVIEW_3] I'm not sure what happened here; but this place went downhill fast. I just had a pizza steak and chicken parm sandwich that were a step above edible. Seriously; I'm still trying to get the taste of the pizza steak out of my mouth. The only thing worse than being excited for a steak sandwich and having it suck is being excited for wings and having them forget to send the damn blue cheese!! Really?? Come on! I can honestly say that based On this experience; I would never go back.   First review: Great food and friendly service. We had an Italian hoagie; and cheesesteak hoagie; and hot wings. All we're fantastic. The rolls are soft and fresh. They were full of delicious meat. The wings were large and the hot sauce is the best I've had in the area. I'll be back for sure. [REVIEW_4] I just read through all of these reviews and giggled over everyone's unique opinion on what exactly the Goleta K-Mart smells like. My own instincts whisper to me ""cat pee."" And yes! a little sulphur (read that in someone else's review; thanks!) Having lived with cats all my life; it smells like home. This isn't a good thing.  It's almost impressive how bad the check-out is. You can find the shortest line; where there is one or no people in front of you; and it will STILL take you like 20 minutes to get through the line. The last time I went; my nail polish rang up as $82 for some weird fucking reason (probably because their computer system is from like 1983) and then the girl had to do the whole thing over again. The penultimate time I was here; I managed to get in a very short line only to have the lady in front of me decide to sign up for a Sears credit card (REALLY WHO DOES THIS SHIT) at the check-out. Which took an impressively long amount of time. Will I still come here to buy my hair dye? Sadly; yes; because it's like half the price of the grocery store. And lord help me if my natural hair color starts growing in.  Also; I seriously almost run someone over every time I try to park. Not in anger; but just because it seems like the elderly like to hide behind cars and then jump into my view at the last second. It's almost like a conspiracy. hmmm....  well; here's hoping someone finally finds the courage to blow the motherfucker up one day. [REVIEW_5] This was possibly the worst experience I've ever had at any restaurant.   General disappointments: They were out of orange juice; diet coke; and to go boxes. Someone waited twenty minutes to order food to go and then overheard the staff tell someone else they were out of to go boxes and couldn't accommodate any take out orders. (I think all customers would have appreciated knowing upfront that these items and services were unavailable.)  Service disappointments: While our initial interaction with our waitress was seemingly standard and friendly; I can't provide any additional positive feedback about her because we barely saw her again.The waiter who brought us our beverages informed us of their lack of diet coke and forgot 2/3 waters. We spent over 35 minutes trying to make eye contact with our waitress to get her attention - and although we made eye contact; she never came over.  We spent 45 minutes waiting for refills on water and coffee (and of course our food); while other customers who had been seated after us and were simply sitting closer to the kitchen enjoyed their food. At this point I stood up and walked over towards the kitchen to request refills; and a different waitress said she would be right with us. Ten minutes later our waitress came over with refills and said our food shouldn't be much longer.   This is now 55 minutes into our breakfast. (Just to be clear we all ordered eggs and the restaurant was not full.) While she was at our table we requested a set of utensils (since only 2/3 of our party was given a set of utensils when we were seated). In addition we requested salt and ketchup - because at this point we had high hopes our food would be arriving soon and our table was not prepared with these items unlike the other tables near us.  Finally over an hour after being seated our food arrived with unmelted cheese on the eggs and 2 packets of ketchup for our table of 3. When the waitress walked away we took the bottle of ketchup from an empty table nearby and ate our breakfast.   This was a disappointing visit to say the least. I recommend you do not visit this establishment under any circumstances. [REVIEW_6] Came down from Jersey after seeing the Dan Band perform; which was phenomenal! We got the urge to order a hookah with a liquor option. Walked over to Fez.. no one attended us at first so we sat down at the couch area. The place was dead for 10pm Friday.   The attendant came and said let me seat you someplace else. I asked to keep the seat I was already at. He said we couldn't; so I told him to speak to whomever to get the approval. The guy came out and ask what's the problem. I said hey boss; your place is dead and we'd like to sit at the large couch area. He said they can't because that's for parties of 8. I said I understand; but there was no one in your store and if that big party ever came; we would move. Their answer: no we can't.   I said no problem; packed my things and was ready to walk out. The guy asked are you really leaving? I said bro; no one is here. The place is dead. What do I have to do? Order a bottle? He said no again.. so.. went to a better spot! Saqqara Hookah bear broad across from City Diner! So much better staff! No young deutche bags trying to show how much more testosterone they have.  Saqqara had great fast hookah service; really really great food and best part; was their service. They actually made the effort to cater to their guest.   Fez.. you are the old 2017. Do better 2018! Saqqara; keep up the great work! You'll squash the competition in no time! [REVIEW_7] I can't believe this place gets ratings higher than 2 and people continue to eat there. The food is not good at all. I have accepted the fact that Nashville suffers a food void but this place is gross. [REVIEW_8] My acrylic nails are lovely with gel ..without oiling my cuticles..grrr .. bit pricey..  However the pedicure was the worst ; very fast and a sloppy foot massage .. [REVIEW_9] First time trying this place as we always drive past it. We felt so rushed. We were looking for a relaxing date night. We sat at a regular table. The bartender who sat us very friendly. The girl who took our order didn't get the order right. I ordered sashimi prior to my meal which never even came out. She was in such a hurry didn't even seem like she was listening. We had three apps; soup and salad all come at the same time. Who does that? It doesn't need to be fine dining but at least let us enjoy one course at a time. Needless to say we won't go back. [REVIEW_10] I have been going to this nail salon for years off and on. I came here back when it was called Tropical Nails and Tom was the owner. Now its Grant Nails and has a different owner. When I started getting my nails done again I lucked out and found an experienced technician named Amy. I stuck with her because she did good nails. Then about 2 months ago Amy left. So I let the owner Angela do my nails. The first time was ok. Then the second time she did them the gel polish (which she talked me into getting instead of regular polish) started to chip within a day. I called and complained; she redid the polish and again within one or two days it was chipping. Now my nails look at mess. I don't trust her to correct the problem. Unfortunately; I'm going to have to find a new nail place. Very upsetting and disappointing. [REVIEW_11] We would have loved to try this restaurant but unfortunately we were told they had stopped serving food when we got there (we got there shortly before 10pm). The Eldorado website clearly stated that they served lunch and dinner until close. I was very unimpressed. We did not even have a chance to try their beer as we had been driving for 5 hours and needed food first. [REVIEW_12] LOVE this place!!  The ironic thing is that this restaurant is in the Meadowood Mall Food Court and it is one of our favorite restaurants in the Reno area.  The first time we tried it we loved it so much we went back 2 days later.  We have been back a few more times since. The Shrimp Scampi is absolutely delicious and the Fish Tacos are the best my husband has ever had.  Can't wait to try their Fish And Chips which seems to be their signature dish.  Around the holiday season they were even selling their Wild Caught Alaskan Cod frozen by the pound to take home. I don't know if they do that year round.  It was $7.95 per pound; which is a great price.  Love the place and we will be back [REVIEW_13] This place was disgusting! We used to eat here quite a bit but it sure has gone downhill fast! The place was dirty (garbage cans overflowing; garbage left on tables because the garbage cans couldn't be used). Nothing was filled up (sauce cups; napkins; silverware). The chicken was very dry and couldn't even be cut with the plaatic knife! Well it was good while it lasted but they have seen the last of me! [REVIEW_14] I used the mobile app; the bill was for $31  and I asked a friend to pick  it up. The store refused to give her the order because I was not there with my Card. I'd done this at least 6 times before without issue.  So I understand that TBELL is trying to watch out for my money.  not letting anyone steal using my account   So why then did they still charge me the $31 even though I never received the food.    Who is it I'm being protected from  hackers or Taco Bell itself.  I'm out $31  I've attempted to contact TBELL but I'm not able to get through to them. [REVIEW_15] So so in love with this place & it is gorgeous. A very spacious & modern design & most of all CLEAN!!!! Love Will; Amanda & Sal! I have made several purchases to include some mods and atty's and being a newbie I have issues from time to time with the devices. Not because the devices aren't working but I may take something apart and can't figure out how to put it back together (newbie ish) lol They always help me and get me back to vaping!!! They have a wide variety of juices; mods; atty's and i'm always in there tasting something. You've got to try it! You will not be sorry! In love with this spot! [REVIEW_16] I was Sitting down  sipping a coffee and  waiting on a sandwich for 25 minutes or more.    so when I went to cancel the order being I had an appointment to make I was told "" but it's ready"" I look at the toast on the toaster tray and not a sandwich ready and say ""just the coffee please I really need to go.""   The owner says ""ok; one fifty for coffee next time if your in a rush say something""      so I hand her a ten dollar bill and she gives me eight dollars back then turns away and leaves  I guess I paid the extra fifty cents for the toast that was not used.......  NEVER AGAIN!!! [REVIEW_17] Wow!  I just wrote a scathing review about El Patron Pizza in Tampa for leaving unwanted and unwelcome fliers under the door of unsuspecting tourist here in Tampa.  I was going to use a lot of the same issues for this review of New York Pizza Grill; but now I'm not sure what to say; only to say it carefully.  I knew there was something not quite right about the greasy looking punk that was meandering in the hallway of the 4 star hotel where I am currently residing.  As soon as I saw the flier I grabbed my room key and went looking for this person.  In hindsight that was not smart; as soon as I got a look at the guy; I ran for the elevator.  Now; I am no shrinking violet; but this guy looked like he's slap his own mother.  After reading the other reviews on here; I guess I should be happy that this employee didn't turn around and attack!  My biggest issue with this business is that they litter the halls and rooms with these fliers.  They sneak into hotels; a place where you feel safe and after this; I don't.  It doesn't seem to matter where it is a 5 star hotel chain or a family run business.  I did call every one of the pizza place that do this; because I felt bad about complaining to the staff at the hotel; but after yesterdays run in with greasy guy for New York Pizza Grill; I had it.  I do not feel safe and I told management that; and the did call the police.  So; for the employee of New York Pizza Grill; if you get caught stuffing fliers under doors where you are not invited and do not belong; you are more than likely going to be arrested.  So when you are out and about making not enough to keep your car running; ask yourself if your boss will bail you out of jail.  I doubt it; they'll probably just get another less than intelligent person to litter; trespass; annoy and sometimes terrify; hotel staff and their guests.  There are numerous reasons not to eat at New York Pizza Grill; but I'm just tossing out a good reason not to work for them. [REVIEW_18] Bad service!  We decided to eat in to take advantage of their byob option and have dinner without cleanup.  The three of us walked in and a fee of the staff members lifted their heads to look but otherwise didn't acknowledge our presence. No hi; how are doing-just a look. We seated ourselves; waited a few minutes then grabbed our own menus.  We waited a few minutes longer and still no acknowledgment; no wine glasses-nothing!  We walked out!  It's a shame because I really like their pizza... [REVIEW_19] Not sure how this is classified as deep dish. The sauce tastes canned and lacks any of that fresh tomato taste. It has such a dark hue and strange flavor and the seasonings are just completely overdone. The crust is just bland. No amount of cheese can help this shame of a pizza attempt. [REVIEW_20] Aw; man. I was hoping I'd previously posted a glowing review of RuSan's so I could prove that once upon a time; I liked it here. But; I didn't so just trust me on this one.  It is with a heavy heart that I relay today's experience over the lunch sushi buffet. Cold; gelatinous; and ~$11/each. It's been a year or three but I remember this being so much better. Don't get me wrong... I love cheap; fast food-ish; ethnic cuisine and I have lovely memories of the Ginger Simmered Beef; Fried Garlic and Bay Shrimp Salad Maki (like I said; once upon a time); but today? Lackluster is an overstatement.  With each bite; I kept hoping the next would be better. But; alas. It wasn't.   Why; RuSan's? With all your new neighboring restauranteurs in The Gulch; is this the taste of complacency? I shake my head in disappointment because I know your potential and cherish what we once had.   On the upside; my water was refreshing and the service was fine.",2
39,"[REVIEW_1] This place is great.  I honestly am at a loss for words!  The food is so good at Blue Sage that you forget you're not eating any meat.  Every time that my boyfriend and I go; we always get the Blue Corn & Asparagus Tacos and the Quesa Havana.  They are amazing!  One word of advice: GET RESERVATIONS!!  Reservations are a MUST any night of the week.  This place is tiny and fills up very fast.  People usually stay for long time; which means the turnover is quite slow. [REVIEW_2] Wow! Amazing service. Didn't know grocery stores could treat people so nice. Made our beach experience so much better. I know most people don't care about the reviews to the grocery store they go to but I recommend you try this one out. You will find what you need and be guided by the employees. [REVIEW_3] Sweet little spot on the beach. Not a single thing to complain about. I go for the old school mom n pop beach hotels and this fits the bill. Oh and WTF is corn holing?? I think I'm glad I missed that. Lol. [REVIEW_4] My husband; Kevin and I; had a lovely lunch today; July 18th. Dawson's food was Very Good. We ordered 2 orders of deep fried fish and a cheeseburger. Our server was Shannon and she was great--pleasant and skilled; we had a leisurely lunch and we never felt rushed. We ordered 3 meals because the lunch portions were smaller; and when we ordered a hamburger; as our 3rd meal; Shannon was nice enough to ask someone in their kitchen to half it and put it on another plate for us. We didn't ask for this courtesy but it was appreciated. It showed us her attention to detail. And our runner for drinks and plate removal was Karolina. She was very accommodating; and very pleasant; too. Dawson's definitely has some of the nicest employees you will find. [REVIEW_5] These folks are truly remarkable. My windows and carpets are absolutely spotless. The crew is professional; courteous; and so reasonably priced. We had them clean and polish our wood floors; and they look AMAZING!!! Highly recommend this fabulous group. [REVIEW_6] Hated this place I went in to try an egg roll and get a sushi roll and both were bad the egg was horrible and the sushi was chewy so I wasnt surprised that I was the only one there [REVIEW_7] My girlfriend and I decided to give this place a try. We got cornbeef special hoagies and fried pickles. Was very delicious and we will be ordering again for sure. Delivery was quick as well. [REVIEW_8] GREAT place to stay! My husband and I spent our anniversary night here and the front desk (Jake) sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne and anniversary card. We stopped at the bar on our way out to dinner and the bartender gave us 2 drinks on the house as well. Great service didn't end at checkout... 2 weeks later my husband realized he left his eyeglasses at the hotel....we called and were transferred to Craig in Loss prevention who said that a pair of eyeglasses were reported found and that they would mail them out to us immediately free of charge. This by far is the best service we've experienced from our travels in the Northeast!! Clean; modern; and excellent service. [REVIEW_9] P-a-R guys did a great job with our event!  All throughout the process; from planning to execution; they were attentive; helpful; flexible and focused on the guests.  Great job! [REVIEW_10] This is one of my favorite hibachi grills of all time. The cooks are always so wonderful; and the food is amazing. [REVIEW_11] The ambiance is pleasant; welcoming; and clean. Sabrina's is a stylized balanced blend of modern and eclectic decor. The service is timely and inviting. Hands down a must stop for delicious food on any road trip or just a hungry night out. Definitely meets up to the 5 Star rating! [REVIEW_12] Their cocktails are amazing! I tried the Hooker with a Heart of Gold and it was delicious. Our group also tried the Pet the Rabbits; George - The 3rd Act and Build in on the Mountain. All were so tasty. [REVIEW_13] Ok; so you've had tacos before?  Nope; not unless you've had one of these or from another taco stand.  Meat; cilantro; onions.  Lime if you want it (you do) and green sauce (a must!). Get the carnitas.  You won't want anything else.    I've been here probably a dozen times and the staff is always very pleasant; serve your food promptly; and will give you free samples from time to time.  Eat them.  On Wednesdays they do a special on whole chickens: two for $15 with rice; beans; tortillas; onions; and poblanos.  This is delicious; falling-off-the-bone smoked chicken that is some of the best chicken I've ever had.  I recommend going with friends; preferably 4; if you're going for the chicken.  The only way this place could be better is if they also served beer. [REVIEW_14] Amazing lunch. Burger is the best in Boise. Fabulous prime rib sandwich and dessert. Everything food wise made in house. Great wine selection and have a $35 and under wine menu. That is appreciated. Excellent service. Will definitely visit again. Recommend highly! [REVIEW_15] Love this store. I have to buy top quality cat food for my older cat and this is one of the few stores that carries the brands she likes. In fact; when I first went there I saw flavors I'd never seen before. Their selection is outstanding. And I think it's great their proceeds go to animal rescue organizations. They truly care about animals and the people that work there have always been friendly and helpful. [REVIEW_16] This is the best pizza in Indianapolis. It's the only pizza that tastes like pizza should that we've ever ordered anywhere in the city. The key is the crust. The second key is their sauce. It's real pizza; with real pizza taste. Most people in Indy don't know what pizza is. Once they go here that will change ! I highly recommend the white pizza with your choice of toppings. I prefer black olives and pepperoni but order the white for a little something different and you won't go wrong !! [REVIEW_17] I went here looking for a gift. I read the good reviews and decided to check it out. As I walked around I did not touch anything in the store until I got to a t shirt which I opened to look and and folded and put down. I got remarks from the owner which I could barely understand and I told her I was just looking at it. I then was looking at the cards (and yes I did actually intend on buying one) I picked one up and the owner said something which I did not understand and I stated excuse me and she said you do not understand my English. I proceeded to look at another card to see what it said and the owner came over took the card from me and told me not to touch them and took every card in the row to inspect as if I damaged them. I have never experienced that in my life where looking at a non breakable item like that was such a horrible deed. Not a way to get business. Hard to believe given so many excellent reviews but I'll spend my money elsewhere. [REVIEW_18] One of my favorite spots in Tucson!   The Restaurant: A romantic and dreamy atmosphere in a historic train depot. They told me at my place of employment to be a ""women's libber"" & not rely on any Prince Charming coming along to take care of me. Whatever...when he comes; I want him to propose to me at Maynard's. Fabulous ""French-inspired"" American cuisine. Sunday Brunch is excellent! I love the creamy white polenta -- delish! Now that the weather has cooled down a bit; you can still enjoy it outside with the toasty patio heaters.  The Bar: Great Happy Hour; Monday-Saturday; from 3 - 6 pm. It's hard to find establishments with Happy Hour on the weekends! They feature $7 bar eats; and 1/2 off glasses of wine; wells; and drafts. They usually have a couple of cocktail specials; as well. On my last visit; I was pleased with a cocktail called; 'Tequilas' Dirty Sister' (resposado; raspberry habenero shrub; grapefruit; and bacanora). It had a nice kick!  The Market: After a brief construction hiatus (although it seemed like an eternity to me); they re-opened at the beginning of November. The first items I grabbed upon their return were sautéed Brussels sprouts w/ grapes (from the deli case) and a bottle of Pinot Grigio to go. Good choices! I'm still making my way through trying some of the items in the newly designed market; but I have especially loved the Croque Monsieur (Madame with a sunny egg) and the raspberry cheesecake in a jar. If you return the jar; you get a $1 off your next purchase. Available seating has expanded in this new layout; with more space to dine-in. I often come here just for grab-and-go meals; though. I love the take out salads & sandwiches (kale Caesar; superfruit grain; portobello w/goat cheese sand; etc....YUM!). You can also find Isabella's Ice Cream and Tucson Tamale Co.'s tamales in the freezer.  The Wine Club: 2 bottles a month (1 red; 1 white); 25% off cases; free monthly tastings; and discounts on wine dinners -- $60 for a 3 month membership or $230 for the year.  The Sommelier here is so very warm and friendly! Check it out! [REVIEW_19] What an awesome hip; bluesy joint that knows how to do a sandwich justice. I mean the love and attention they provide to proving quality products is hands down top notch. The roast beef is off the chain!!!! To taste roast beef with such a rich flavor and be extremely moist and delicious and don't even get me started on their bread. I mean sturdy enough to hold the heaping mounds of meat and toppings and yet still be delicate enough to yield a soft and airy loaf. I'm a sucker for their original roast beef on garlic cheese bread. I love their chip selection; it's not your ordinary run of the mill variety but why would it be; nothing about this place is ordinary. I love eating the other half of my sandwich the next day; now that speaks volumes of a true roast beef sandwich. The portions are large enough for me to eat half and be full and enjoy the rest for breakfast or dinner the next day. This place reigns supreme in the sandwich world!!! They're knocking it out of the park every time. You can't go wrong with whatever you select. I've tried 3 different sandwiches and everything has been delicious. It's real quality ingredients done right with a whole lot of love. [REVIEW_20] I loved berix! I went there because they had burek (also called pita - but it isn't pita bread) And they had potato burek that day! My favorite. Very nice people. All the staff was very friendly and accommodating. We were in town for a convention and accidentally over-ran the place without intending to by all showing up here without knowing everyone else also was coming. But we all wanted some Bosnian food and we knew where to go! They have other food too; but just a great place with good food. Good service - employees remained chill. Place was super clean. Bosnian (Turkish) coffee was good. Thanks berix!",18
40,"[REVIEW_1] Excellent italian food at good prices.  On weekends you need a reservation.  It is small; the tables are close to one another; and it is loud.  I can understand how it could bug people; and if the food wasn't so good; it would bug me.  Overall though; the crowd; noise; size; only add to the experience of being at a popular restaurant with good food. [REVIEW_2] Awful! Typical Philly ""hot spot"" that appeals to hipsters and snobs that would rather have a ""scene"" than quality dining. We ordered several pizzas. They were thin with burnt crust and room temperature. Worst of all they were $15-16 a pop! Insane. I could stay in the suburbs and go to a mom & pop joint where real unpretentious folks go and get a pizza ten-times as good for half the cost!  Plastic chairs and little to no atmosphere. The service wasn't bad and that was the high point! I hate that places like this can actually be successful. A total half-assed effort catered to mindless hipsters and wannabes that think it's cool to do the Philly thing for a few years. Real Philly people know where to get Pizza and Vetri ain't it! [REVIEW_3] This place is ridiculously good it's pretty small inside but they still accommodate a lot of guests. We went on a busy weekend morning and we were able to get a seat right away despite finding the last parking spot. We saw a breakfast sandwich on the Yelp photos and asked if it was on the menu our waitress that it was not on the menu but was still able to make it and it was ridiculously inexpensive. They have really good food at really really really great prices I highly suggest this place! [REVIEW_4] Was in Indy for work back in July. The pizza here is really the best you will find in the area. Lunch buffet is good. I'm a vegetarian so naturally selection can be limited. 2 days in a row with 2 different employees; they made a fresh vegetarian friendly pizza. Both pizzas were very good; and with the plain pizza; salad and pasta in the buffet; lunch was great. The people working here were very friendly in a genuine way. Not fake McYouknowwho friendly.  I am a harsh critic when it comes to pizza and this pizza was very good; not Sao Paulo good; but enough that Lucas is on my stop list next time im in IN for work. [REVIEW_5] True barber shop. You can tell they care about giving great haircuts. Very reasonable price. This place was recommended by two different friends so I had to check it out. I'll be going back. [REVIEW_6] This is totallly one of the best hotels in the city.  The rooms are heavily appointed; and the halls are too.  You can't go wrong here. [REVIEW_7] Just ate here; with my wife; for the first time. Chilled at the bar; had a beer; and ate some pizza. Great service and good times! [REVIEW_8] This place had been recommended to me several times by a few of my clients (I'm a hair stylist); I've been twice now and have had a wonderful experience both times. The employees are very polite and professional seem to get along great with one another. Aside from that my actual services; a mani and pedi; by two different people on separate visits; were both outstanding. It's very clean and I didn't feel rushed at all. I will most def be back. [REVIEW_9] It's a small walk-up business the the flavor is on point! Pauline greeted me at the window and it felt (and smelled) like I was back at home on the far south side (wild; wild 100s) ordering from one of the local joints.  You could smell the well-seasoned beef and the onions and peppers from the car.  I ended up ordering 3 Italian beefs;  two polishes (""Maxwell street - style""); and one Chicago dog.  I was not disappointed. There are 3 sizes of beef sandwiches;  sm-med-lrg; I can't imagine eating a large in one sitting.  Guess I just don't eat like that anymore. The beef was well - seasoned and flavorful. and with the juice ""on; absolutely delicious!  I had the option of juice ""on"" or on the side.  ""on"" was definitely the way to go; but; it's also a bit messy (not for eating on the go). Definitely will return. [REVIEW_10] Owner and team are amazing and takes pride in their work!!! [REVIEW_11] I work nearby & come here just about every day for lunch. Delicious sandwiches! I love their tuna. Fresh produce. Always very fast service. Love this place!! [REVIEW_12] Cheerful people who know their stuff work here.  The place itself is bright and roomie.  The array of breads and pastries gives one pause.  And while I was enjoying my coffee and chocolate croissant they took an order for a flourless chocolate cake which was to have a layer of raspberry and the top was to be decorated for a birthday!  I was drooling.  The calm with which they work shows in the taste and look of every item. They are closed Monday but be sure to double check as you would not want to be disappointed. [REVIEW_13] Always hot & i'm always left satisfied. The hot wings are addictive! The ghetto punch is amazing! [REVIEW_14] Best service in town and best prices. Even the phone call just felt good. I called fast glass and they wanted to charge me 200$! About 80$ more than last time. So i looked around and found these guys. Called them and from the moment someone picked up i was treated wonderfully; they charged 165$ and it was worth the price too. I chip in my windshield spidered out and i was worried about a ticket; they fit me in that day. They vaccumed; wiped down the inside of my car and washed the windows. Waiting area is cozy and has tea; water and free suckers. They all treated me like a person; not a dumb girl like fast glass does. Ill definitely be going back. [REVIEW_15] The most friendly mom and pop coffee house ever.  The coffee is perfect and strong. The pastries are yummy and moist. Worth the drive for me. [REVIEW_16] Great place for breakfast! I had the waffle; which was fluffy and perfect; and home fries which were nice and smashed and crunchy. Friendly waitstaff. Will definitely be back! [REVIEW_17] This is my third allergist in Reno.  This guy is super smart and up on all the latest studies.  He is a great doctor. [REVIEW_18] Daniel and Ben exceeded my expectations with their level of dedication and professionalism in helping me get the heat working at my house during the frigid cold blast we had last week. Before swapping parts out and increasing the repair cost; they were able to fix the wiring on the unit and saved me a lot of money. I would recommend them to anyone looking for fair; honest service. Much appreciated guys!!! [REVIEW_19] I've been going to Vo's nails in Capilano for years and always have a good experience. Jenny; Tracey and staff know their stuff and will treat you with kindness; respect and most importantly; like a friend. I wouldn't go anywhere else for my mani's and pedi's. [REVIEW_20] This is a really interesting restaurant. It's not our typical kind of place but we are so glad we went. They have burgers/sandwiches and sushi. I got a couple of sushi rolls that were divine. My husband got the hot fish sandwich and fries which he also enjoyed. They also have spiked shakes! So much yum. Plus the service was great. We will be back.",19
41,"[REVIEW_1] A friend recommended me to check them out and it was totally worth!   They did a great job on my Mercedes; took them only a day and came out brand new!   Also they were decently priced compared to every other body shop I got a quote from.  Thanks guys! [REVIEW_2] Finally got to check out Cafe Soleil. One word: Delicieux!! Being from France; I had high expectations; I don't play with my pastries! Boy do they deliver; the croissants were buttery; nice and flaky; and melt in your mouth...even better then some of the ones I had in France. Not surprisingly; the baker ""Nico"" is french; and you could taste the difference in the food.  The fact that the products are imported does make a big difference in the taste; it's definitely authentic.  Nico was very personable and friendly; it was fun chatting with an ex-parisian :). The one negative thing is they are too far from me; 45 mins drive; but to satiate my sweet tooth; I will definitely be back! I highly recommend this bakery. [REVIEW_3] Came here on a whim a few years ago.  Was hoping it was as good as I remembered. I Was Not Disappointed. Everyone I brought with me was really impressed.   Standouts include the pork belly and the fish tacos. Cocktail program is on point as well.  Go.  See for yourself. [REVIEW_4] I have always dreaded going to the hair salon.  I hated the phony atmosphere of most places and I really dreaded the small talk I would be forced to have with my stylist.  Maybe I am unusually insecure; but I always felt intimidated in most salons.   Then; one day a couple of years ago; I wandered into Andre's salon and I never looked back.   Andre is warm and personable and made me feel at ease immediately.  Right off the bat; we connected on a topic I care about--dogs--and I didn't feel uncomfortable at all.  Oh; and the cut and color were fantastic!  My highlights last longer than highlights I have received from any other salon. For the past year or so; Christopher has been styling my hair and I LOVE him to death.  He is incredibly sweet; down-to-earth and talented!  My hair looks amazing for days after he styles it and; try as I might; I can never get it to look as good as he can. The last time I was at the salon; Christopher; Leah and I had a blast reminiscing about '80s fashion!  I can't remember a time when I enjoyed going to the hair salon (which is probably because I never have!). Also; back in the spring; I asked Andre if he would be interested in donating a gift for a charity 5K I was helping to organize.  Being the wonderful person he is; Andre didn't hesitate and put together a beautiful basket that was a hit at the race!  Andre has a good heart and that it what I love about going to his salon! I also love that clients can schedule appointments online through schedulicity! Great prices; great cuts; great color; great space; convenient scheduling options and; most importantly; great people--you will not regret choosing Andre for your next cut or color! [REVIEW_5] So glad I finally listened to my boyfriend.... this place hands down has the most delicious and amazing shrimp po boy I've had in the entire state of Florida.  Definitely recommend!!!! You will not be disappointed [REVIEW_6] My boyfriend and I decided to go to The Smiling Elephant on a Friday night. We had about a 30 minute wait. Once we got inside we ordered. I got the Gai Jee and asked for it to be ""hot"". They gave me a sauce on the side. I poured it on top of my grilled chicken and white rice. I ate it and the sauce tasted awful. I thought maybe I was being picky so I let my boyfriend try. He thought it smelled and tasted awful. The only part of my meal that I could eat was the grilled chicken which was good; but not worth the price. Also the next day I was sick with food poisoning the entire day. I have never had food poisoning in my life and that was the only thing I had eaten differently in the past two days.  On the other hand. My boyfriend had the Pad Thai and he loved it. I tried it and it tasted pretty good.   No matter how good the Pad Thai was; I am not going to risk getting sick or getting a terrible meal again. [REVIEW_7] I attended PMA's Risk Management Professional prep course and simply put... It was excellent.  Between the outstanding instructor Karl Cheney and PMA's tools on their website; I was able to pass on my first attempt. I would recommend this course to anyone preparing for any PMI Certification. [REVIEW_8] Great burgers!  Still full in the morning with a meat hangover.  Fries were excellent too.  Service was good.  Busy night but felt taken care of.  Highly recommend. [REVIEW_9] Great family owned restaurant with fantastic mexican food and BYO (T).  Medium sized restaurant with two separate dining areas; good for large groups as you can reserve the entire back room.  The service is fantastic; even when we've shown up 20 minutes prior to closing time; the wait staff was still incredibly hospitable.  The margaritas they mix are great; which is saying something as I typically don't enjoy margaritas.  The food is delicious; and parking is very easy in the area.  If you find yourself in Northern Liberties; give it a try!  They frequently run specials on Groupon and Living Social; so keep your eyes open and save a few bucks! [REVIEW_10] One of their guests went on a rampage and started punching random people; knocking one to the ground.  I told the bartender to call security; then I restrained the assailant as efficiently as humanly possible; causing no injuries; no striking; basically a bear hug; until security finally arrived.  Instead of a thank you I was told to go to my room or I would be trespassing--- fine; Did they look at the video and figure it out? Make it right later?  No.  I was treated poorly; and when I called days later; I got no response.  Spoke with Art in Security; and no call back.   Not  the way to treat someone who helped you out.   I will not be going back to Peppermill. [REVIEW_11] This place was exactly what I expected it to be...a hole in the wall in a slightly sketchy part of town with delicious pupusas! Everyone in my 8-person group said they would definitely return. Our fantastic server Kathy spoke great English and was wonderful at suggesting and explaining. You could tell there was a lot of pride in the quality; and the kitchen folks were chiming in with recommendations as our server took our order.  As this was the 1st stop in a progressive dinner; we ordered only the famous pupusas and tamales. I haven't seen such a great list of pupusa ""flavor options"" anywhere else (chorizo; pork; chk; cactus; zucc; cheese etc); and each was super tasty.   I have never been a huge fan of tamale's but these were fantastic; and again; many choices of fillings.   We also had plantains- nothing to write home about. They do not sell any alchohol at all; but did let us bring in wine (hilariously out of place!) [REVIEW_12] They had me at the copper bunny...vodka; pineapple jalapeño tequila; lime juice and sparkling wine in a beautiful copper bunny (it packs a wallop). Don't try to find one to buy...they mold and make them just for the restaurant. Starters included fresh chilled gulf oysters and crispy conch fritters with pineapple tarter sauce.  We then proceeded to two tuna ""small bites:"" sushi grade hamachi lightly tossed with a guava curry and papaya; and more traditional tuna tartare...they couldn't have been better.  We were a little scared to try the curried goat but it was incredibly tender and the curry paired perfectly with the melt-in-your-mouth sweet potato gnocchi.  No room for dessert but we can't wait to come back to NOLA and Compère Lapin! [REVIEW_13] Most pleasant; attentive thoughtful professional staff AND most importantly the best quality steak we have ever  eaten out!   Our dad is in the angus hall of fame and we eat beef everywhere! Delicious ! Don't miss this place. Only warning If you have dessert pass on the coffee. [REVIEW_14] Having stayed here several times; it is my favorite hotel. The staff is excellent. Really exceptional. Everyone from housekeeping to front desk staff to valets.  Rooms are clean; heating and AC are quiet; beds are very comfortable and they make it feel special.  Special K is awesome. I cannot say enough about how wonderful and helpful he has been over all of our visits. One of the best reasons to visit this hotel. Did I mention the exceptional staff?  Turn-down service is Sucre chocolates on your pillow. Sweets for the sweet dreams.  The bathroom wasn't as slippery this time.   This was the first time we used the valet service and it worked great. No more than a 10 minute wait for the car. You can text them from your phone and they text back with how long it will take.  They also hosted a Gold Status reception. We made a brief appearance on our way to a Mardi Gras ball.  Our only glitch was a mini-bar charge on our bill. We didn't consume any of their food or drink and they happily removed it from the bill.  We will be back. Note to hotel: please put Louis back in the elevator. [REVIEW_15] Food is amazing. Best burger and fries in Quakertown - period. Seriously - their food is amazing.  Their beer menu is extensive and the atmosphere is just awesome.  Customer for life. [REVIEW_16] So good! Amazing service and the food is always good. Tried it one of the first days they were open and now I am addicted! A must try! [REVIEW_17] The best Japanese restaurant! Stumbled upon this with my family and gave it a try... Dinner and a show! I saw tricks I haven't seen in any Japanese restaurant before! And every single food dish was phenomenal. If only I lived in SB! I'd be here every night! [REVIEW_18] Delicious pizza and cheesesteaks! The taco pizza is especially good. Used to be awesome walking to Spatola's when I was younger from my friends houses. But; nonetheless the food remains delicious. [REVIEW_19] I'm becoming a big fan of this place. I love the fact that the staff and owner are very personable. The tap list ranges from excellent to outstanding. The menu has some nice different options like the pig wings; the bacon 3 ways sandwich; and always has specials on the chalk board. [REVIEW_20] This is just my first visit to M3 and we didn't eat only drinks at the bar.  But our bartender was fantastic with us. She made sure to pay attention to us and never let us sit without a full glass even though it was a busy Fri night and was quite busy. I have just moved to the area and happen to be barley a block away. I will be happy to review the food soon; I just got to get my butt in a chair there lol!",18
42,"[REVIEW_1] Jhonny's is incredibly honest and trustworthy. They could have tried to tell me that I had a rat problem and needed to pay $750 like the other pest control company that came out. However; Tony took time to explain to us how to set bait boxes at no extra charge to keep our home rat free since we live near mountains and a creek. Highly recommend! [REVIEW_2] This hotel was nasty. There are termites and ants crawling out of the floor and up the wall in droves outside our room door. Don't stay here. I uploaded a couple of pics of the bugs outside our door. So gross. [REVIEW_3] I am an amateur athlete. I first met Dr. Ferrel when I was playing softball. He was watching my game when I was severely injured.  He treated me on the field by relocating my ankle and then told me to come to his office for treatment. I told him I could not afford that as a single mom on a teacher's salary. Instead; I saw a physician. He said it would be months before I would play again. Depressed and without much hope; I reached out to Dr. Ferrel again. He did treat me as he promised. Not only did he treat me; he healed me within weeks instead of months. Over the years Dr. Ferrel has worked on me with amazing results each time. He will always be my hero... [REVIEW_4] My husband and I ate lunch here a month ago and the experience wasn't the best. We had to wait at least 20 minutes to get our drinks and we heard our waitress complain she was overworked right in front of us... I doubt we will be back. [REVIEW_5] Is it okay to say this is my favorite brunch spot even though all I've ever had here is their grits? I would definitely try one of their other courses and I'm pretty sure they're amazing; but it is so hard to not get my favorite thing off their menu! Their portion is so huge; i usually share it with another person (if I'm not being greedy)! You can literally top anything onto your dish and they vary from .50 cents to 1.00 dollar.  I love to add on avocados; red bell peppers; bacon; cheddar; and mushrooms! Their grits are incredible; it is not grainy nor watery. It's just perfect. I can go on and on. but I'm pretty sure you get the point!   Eventually; i will try their other dishes; but for now; it's all about their grits. [REVIEW_6] Dog friendly. Awesome wine and beet. Cool friendly people . [REVIEW_7] Still waiting for the gift card apology that was promised. Maybe their oversight or just a comment on Yelp! to make customer service appear better.  It has been almost 6 months and still no gift card. Customer service not a priority here. [REVIEW_8] Food is expensive and not worth it. My hubby had carnitas - very dry. I had the scallops- expensive and undercooked. Not even a browned crust. Rice was served ""family style "" but do mushy and overlooked. I had a mango margarita that was completely bland and flavorless. We will not be going back. City fish was not good; but this is worse. And so disappointing- the idea of fresh quality Mexican food could have been so good. [REVIEW_9] Would not recommend; the customer service is awful. Went for Sunday lunch only about 8 customers in the building; Took 15 minutes before they got our drink order. Ordered iced tea but they must've had a shortage of ice; the tea was cold but only few pieces of ice.  Once we got drinks we placed appetizer and food order. Took only 55 minutes for our appetizer and food to show up at the same time. Only to find hair in the food. I made comment to employee about taking so long to for food and they replied ""well we only have two cooks"" then she waked away. Like its my problem that the appetizer and food took so long. While I sat and waited I started noticing how careless and rude the staff was yelling back and forth across kitchen; cooks yelling to employees that were sitting down eating at kitchen area. feminine male playing around thrusting his hips as if he was having sex with someone. I threw up in my mouth and lost my appetite at this point. I figured it was just a bad batch of employees until I walked outside and look back at the building and seen all the torn up American flags. The owner and management obviously just don't have respect for anything or anybody. [REVIEW_10] I went in for my first massage yesterday and saw Shelly. It was THE BEST hour of my life.I will be back. [REVIEW_11] When I first walked in; it seemed an ok place but by the time I realized it was a mistake to get mani and pedi done here; it was too late. I got shellac done and they applied 10-12 coats of paint and gel.  It started peeling off in 3-4 days.  My nails look all rough after the nail paint has peeled off. Also; the people working there were talking to each other in Mandarin.  I felt really awkward there. They used some neon green colored massage lotion or something.  Ewww.  I am never going back! [REVIEW_12] Amazingly awesome! Tried a couple of different things; everything was delicious! Their Bloody Mary was one of the worst I've ever had; but I didn't go there to drink; and besides that not what they are known for. Their mojoto are good tho. [REVIEW_13] Changing this to a 1 after I just had to pay $10 to park. Seriously?   Not like they aren't making any money on anything else in there..... [REVIEW_14] I had the most disappointing and appalling experiencing ordering catering from this specific Chick-fil-A location. When I voiced my frustration with the Manager on Duty; I was made to feel like my problem was of no concern or care to her and her team and she was unwilling to de-escalate my frustrating situation. She was much more interested in being right than doing what she could to help me as the customer of a large order. I would NOT recommend ordering catering from this location unless you have the time and flexibility to take a chance on a tight schedule getting disrupted for the group you are feeding. [REVIEW_15] I have taken my small pomimo here 4 times and before I hadn't had any complaints. I had set up an appointment on Thursday which I had walked to and the power was out but they still told me to keep my dog there. 30 mins after being home I get a call saying they can't do it and that we need to reschedule. I rescheduled for Saturday morning; two hours they call me tell me to come get him. I paid 60$ and his haircut is literally a hack job; i could of done something similar with my boyfriends trimmers! I called to inform them and they were not picking up my call.. What a waste of my Christmas money! [REVIEW_16] I experienced the worst customer service possible I've waited 15 minutes for an employee to ask me if I was being taken care of while my food was done and sitting and also the soda's in the refrigerator were expired and out of date I contacted the manager on duty and the employee did nothing I tried giving them another chance and this continues to be an issue I will no longer come to this location [REVIEW_17] The bouncers are awful; but I would be too if I were 4-feet tall and had an infinite amount of pent-up aggression and shielded childhood memories.   This place stands for everything Reno shouldn't be. Choose LEX only if the sole alternative is being waterboarded during thanksgiving dinner. [REVIEW_18] Great grocery store in the Mid-city neighborhood. It had great deli; soup; hot bar; and salad bar options. It was like a waaaay less expensive Whole Foods. On the weekends they had crawfish or lobster boils by the lbs. This would be my go to store if I lived here for sure. Big plus it's LOCAL!!!  * Fried Chicken was BOMBlicious!!!! [REVIEW_19] Walked up with a group to serve 10 - parents and kids.  After trying to get someone to come to walk up window; we left because they were ignoring us 5-10 minutes and no one else was waiting for walk up service. [REVIEW_20] This is the worst Mexican food I've ever had. The salsa definitely comes from a jar. My friend got an agave sweetened margarita for $9 and we all thought it tasted like straight agave nectar and water. The cheese on the tacos looks like Kraft cheese from a bag; and the only other topping was iceberg lettuce. You might be able to find better food at a gas station.",7
43,"[REVIEW_1] We were really hoping to find a very good; local Vietnamese restaurant ...unfortunately this is not it! After reading the glowing reviews of other diners we had high hopes...but after our mediocre meal I thought maybe we had stumbled into the wrong place. The decor was nonexistent; bathroom filthy; and our appetizer was served after our main courses. If the food was excellent I could overlook all that...but the food was very disappointing. We won't be back...and our search continues for a good Vietnamese meal. [REVIEW_2] Staying at the resort; thought we would grab a bite to eat because of the location next to the pool.  Bartender can not finish one transaction before starting another.   Fails at multi-tasking.  The food came 15 later than told soggy and cold.  Shrimp under cooked.  Chicken strips edible after the 2 inch thick leather exterior.  Yummy.  Fries cold and limp.  I ate on all over St. Pete beach and this was the worse food we encounters.  Don't wast your time; go somewhere else on the strip.  Use it for drinks not grub [REVIEW_3] Found them on YELP! Awesome Men's barber. This is a true men's high end barber. They didn't miss any amenity! Awesome barbers; Jamie Nicole was awesome; especially for her first time cutting my hair it was perfect! Highly Recommended! [REVIEW_4] Worst service of my life!!!!  The food is cold; I order buffalo and they never bring me also the waitress fights for the positions because she say it's my tips and my section when we want use a boots. 12/4/16 - 7:01pm [REVIEW_5] We ordered delivery because I'm sick at home. For $12 carnitas that was supposed to come with cilantro; onion and salsa; non of these was included. they came with only a little bit of meat in two taco shells and tasted unseasoned. My pork shoulder was very chewy and was supposed to come with pickles but didn't.  The beans; potato salad; and coleslaw were all filled less than half way. Only good things are the toasts. We will not order from this place ever again. [REVIEW_6] Best bagels around for sure. The vegetable cream cheese is to die for and I love that they put the toppings on both sides of the bagel so that there is not good side or bad side. [REVIEW_7] Service was GREAT! Food....meh. Jambalaya was almost room temperature and no okra at all. Won't be back. [REVIEW_8] Went here with high hopes considering it's handmade and most of the reviews said it was good. It was worse than a little Ceasers Pizza. The sauce tasted like it was from a can like school lunch. The cheese was terrible quality; even though they advertise it's 100% real it;and really isn't. The garlic knots were okay; better than the pizza but was not fond of the chunks of garlic on top. There are so many better pizza places to spend your money. [REVIEW_9] Horns gets one star for the waitress with the amber necklace... she was fabulous.  If not for her cheerful friendly demeanor and attention it would have been no stars.  Burned pancakes  that tasted sour.  The kitchen obviously didn't care about the product they sent out. [REVIEW_10] Great Mediterranean joint in lil ole Ruskin!! The falafel wraps; schwarma and daily specials are ALWAYS TASTY! Thank you for putting Ruskin on the map with your bangin' eats!! [REVIEW_11] This place is wonderful! We found it today while looking for dedicated Gluten Free restaurants. The bakery is ran by a friendly; hard-working mother who's autistic son works there as well; and they only employ individuals on the spectrum.  The items were all great. None of the foods tasted any less as gluten free; casein free desserts. The cookie dough chocolate cupcake was especially good. I really like that they have interesting options too; like jalapeño strawberry bread; and the owner said they are coming up with new ideas each week and letting people vote on them on social media.  The owner went out of her way to be kind. She realized that our toddler is also on the spectrum; and she invited her to help water plants out front. The workers were perfectly accommodating and not phased by our daughter throwing a tantrum on the floor.  They definitely seem supportive of the community. I saw that their artwork on the wall is only from individuals with mental disabilities. They sell autism shirts there as well. Definitely a great place for the community! [REVIEW_12] Awful. We switched years ago to AT&T because of Charter's terrible service; surprise charges; crappy equipment and AWFUL; AWFUL; AWFUL customer service. A salesman showed up at our door the other day saying that things were better and customer service and the company had an overhaul. He promised that the Internet would be faster and better than the one we were using; saying that each device would be connected to 100mb; not every device sharing that 100mb; our cable would be the exact same and we'd have a land line on top of it all for the same price that we were paying with AT&T. Absolute crap! We had the most basic of basic channels and the Internet was MUCH slower than AT&T. We were less than 24 hours in with Charter and attempted to get things corrected. No one would work with us and offered to charge us more to have the same channels we had before. The salesman left his cell number for us to contact him should there be any problem whatsoever and he would correct it immediately. When we attempted to contact the salesman he didn't answer the first time; and anytime after that it went straight to voicemail. Back to AT&T it is. [REVIEW_13] Our sales person C.C was great she did everything she can to get me into the car; i was approved was handed the keys to the car etc. even had me put all my things from my trade in car to my new car; once we get to the finance dept. to sign the final paperwork; We were there for about 4hours that day; they tell me that they forgot to include sales tax from my lease trade in to the car I'm purchasing; which would bring my payments up to $24 per month which would bring my monthly payments to about $491 instead of the $461 we agreed on or i could pay the $930 est. now. I advise them all i could do was the amount we agreed on could not put down anything more. The next day i have Nick contact me and stated if i put down another $1;000 they could help me out; i stated  i could not; he basically told me that ""we are doing you a favor and helping you out due to your credit history; you could pay this now or later but you will have to pay the sales tax"". I felt like he was talking down to me and very unprofessional; i advised him could anything else be done since it was a error on there part; he basically stated no; and said if i could not make another $1;000 down on top of the $1;000 I' already putting down there nothing they could do; and kept saying we are bascially helping you out b/c of your credit history and just kept repeating it; when i stated i could not; he hung up the phone. This has been the worse delearship i honestly have been to; after spending 4hours on Saturday there and another 4hours on Monday.. [REVIEW_14] Worst place to shop!   I've never been insulted in my life!!! Prejudice as can be.  I have never been at any store and have been asked to leave my purse outside the dressing room!!! Mind you my purse was no bigger than a 6 inches in size.... Not to mention I am the only one that left my purse...  I don't know about any of you; but purse is somewhat personal just to be left blatantly without anyone watching it.  I truly felt because my color ain't right they thought that I would steal... Hell the place was so unorganized anyways.  Please the store was in such disarray that you can't find anything at all... Needless to say; I am so disappointed [REVIEW_15] This was possibly the worst experience I've ever had at any restaurant.   General disappointments: They were out of orange juice; diet coke; and to go boxes. Someone waited twenty minutes to order food to go and then overheard the staff tell someone else they were out of to go boxes and couldn't accommodate any take out orders. (I think all customers would have appreciated knowing upfront that these items and services were unavailable.)  Service disappointments: While our initial interaction with our waitress was seemingly standard and friendly; I can't provide any additional positive feedback about her because we barely saw her again.The waiter who brought us our beverages informed us of their lack of diet coke and forgot 2/3 waters. We spent over 35 minutes trying to make eye contact with our waitress to get her attention - and although we made eye contact; she never came over.  We spent 45 minutes waiting for refills on water and coffee (and of course our food); while other customers who had been seated after us and were simply sitting closer to the kitchen enjoyed their food. At this point I stood up and walked over towards the kitchen to request refills; and a different waitress said she would be right with us. Ten minutes later our waitress came over with refills and said our food shouldn't be much longer.   This is now 55 minutes into our breakfast. (Just to be clear we all ordered eggs and the restaurant was not full.) While she was at our table we requested a set of utensils (since only 2/3 of our party was given a set of utensils when we were seated). In addition we requested salt and ketchup - because at this point we had high hopes our food would be arriving soon and our table was not prepared with these items unlike the other tables near us.  Finally over an hour after being seated our food arrived with unmelted cheese on the eggs and 2 packets of ketchup for our table of 3. When the waitress walked away we took the bottle of ketchup from an empty table nearby and ate our breakfast.   This was a disappointing visit to say the least. I recommend you do not visit this establishment under any circumstances. [REVIEW_16] I was so disappointed when this opened; I was hoping for Nashville's first real authentic Greek restaurant (Athens notwithstanding).  This isn't Greek; it isn't even Mediterranean. It's pseudo-Americanized versions of Mediterranean classic cuisine. The corporate chefs got so many things wrong:  Skordalia is a classic Greek dip made out of potatoes and garlic (not bread).  Avgolemono is chicken soup with egg; lemon and rice -- not this thin; awful broth they are currently serving. If one wants true Greek cooking; one should go to Greektown in either Detroit or Toronto.  Just say no. [REVIEW_17] We'll I thought the place was going out of business. They basically had no cigar selection. [REVIEW_18] Rude staff. Food was subpar and greasy. I got a breakfast sandwich and it was greasy and soggy. Coffee was terrible and the espresso machine was out of service. [REVIEW_19] A few years ago my parents; my brothers and i went to this restaraunt for my birthday. We ordered the usual huge spread because we love thai food. But there was a surprise in the tea. A roach; swimming around. The server brought a new pot (no apology) and that was all. No taking the tea off the bill; no acknowledgement of what happened; nothing. We haven't eaten there since. [REVIEW_20] I've been here many times and I always come back. Great location! The service however is touch and go. It's also noteworthy that I didn't see any African American servers or bartenders. The food is good; but not great; and I haven't seen a mouse the last couple times I've been. Enjoy!",4
44,"[REVIEW_1] Went on the Cupcake and Macaroon Tour last weekend.  We went to four places.  The first business was a glorified coffee shop.  No cupcakes or macaroons. We were given half of a ricotta cookie.  Although delicious; it was not a cupcake or macaroon.  The second place gave us a quarter of a cupcake. They did not have enough of each flavor; so when it was my turn; the one I wanted was gone. The third establishment was so awful; they should have paid me to try their sample.  It was a vegan bakery free of gluten; dairy; nut; soy; egg and any other allergen one can think of.  I am sensitive to people with food allergies as my husband has them; but I'm not sure why this establishment was included.  How can a cupcake taste good after you've removed all of the key ingredients?  The last place we went to was the one that was supposed to have macaroons.  We were told they ""ran out"" and instead received a quarter of a defrosted mediocre cupcake.  How do I know it had been frozen and not fresh?  It was still partially frozen in the center!  Luckily; it was a beautiful day to be outside; because this tour left a lot to be desired. [REVIEW_2] I had not patronized McDonald's in many years as there are many other establishments that actually seem to work for their customers business.   It took over five minutes before one of the four employees asked gruffly if I had been waited on. I placed an order for a #1 meal which is their Big Mac. As I waited for 14 minutes to get my meal several other customers approached the counter  complaining about their order accuracy. I watched as several people had to repeat this process three or more times before getting their order right or they gave up in frustration. No staff member including the English speaking manager/supervisor ever apologized or acknowledged the customers exasperation it gave the assistance if caring at all.   I figured with my long wait that I would at least get a hot fresh meal but apparently my food must have been praised long before my arrival. I received a cold Big Mac that was half unassembled in the box with my side of cold soft fries. Not sure why it took 20 minutes from the time I arrived at the counter until I received my order since the time was obviously not doesn't preparing my food and there were not many other customers in the store.   Lack of employee engagement; lack of empathy and poor or no management seemed to be the order of the day here. How on earth they can keep the doors open with every customer on site complaining and NO response or concern from staff is simply amazing. [REVIEW_3] Just love the grits; can't find these anywhere else in Reno-Sparks.  Spinach Mozzarella; pepper jack!  Yumm  Good tri-tip- not chewy and BBQ chicken in either a sandwich or wrap.  Super nice folks too. True family operation. [REVIEW_4] Why did it just take over 5 minutes for me to get only a medium coffee?  Because there wasn't any coffee made in a coffee establishment; that's why. In addition; there are non-customers sitting in all of the outdoor seats and the floors and counters are sticky. I'm done with this Cosi. I'll be going to Brew Ha Ha from now on. The customer service is just too poor here. [REVIEW_5] Paid $18 for a poor gel manicure job. There was already a smudge when she finished and didn't even bother to correct it. Also the polish did not get enough coats applied so my nails have a soft texture to them. I will be going somewhere else and having this manicure removed. [REVIEW_6] Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday around 1:30 . We had a large party of 10. I did not call ahead but lucky us; they were clearing a Large long table booth that sat us all; no wait. Its a bit loud; even mid afternoon; so expect to talk with the other end folks.  Service was good; laid back and friendly.  We started off with the Tatar tot fondue; a variety of Burger's and Shake's.  I had the Fenway; that has sausage and pepper's. Also had the sweet potato tots; a local beer on tap  and the Kentucky Thunder shake. All was awesome in taste and flavor. Also no complaints from the other 9 in the group. Definitely would go back. [REVIEW_7] Every dam time we come here it's an issue!!! Either the steak isn't cooked right or hair in the plate or a piece of something in the kitchen got in the plate smh I try always giving the benefit of the doubt but this is far beyond that!!! The manager don't even care.. all he said was sorry instead of saying hey we will cook it to your liking or do you want something else instead!!! Nope he just came to the table and said oh sorry and walked away!!!!    His name is Amonte or something like that!!!  I don't mind paying whatever for a good meal but this is ridiculous!!!! The waitress on the hand was awesome!!! [REVIEW_8] Brilliant Japanese restaurant. Simple black and white decoration with comfortable seating. They offer a 7 course traditional Japanese menu for a very reasonable price (USD85) given the quality. We had such delicacies as king crab; oysters; sweat water and salt water eels; octopus and different types of fish for the sashimi and sushi courses. Service is excellent - as you would expect in Japan itself. Highly recommendable. [REVIEW_9] I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights for the memorial day weekend. I had one of the worst experience in this hotel. When we checked in I saw bed mattresses and pillows lying outside our room. When we entered the room; the air conditioner was not working. So I went down and told the person on the reception about it and she told me that a engineer will come soon to fix it.  After 20 min no one came. I had checked in with my family and it was a very hot day (max temperature: 94 degree Fahrenheit). This time I called the front desk and the phone was busy. I tried it few more time and I got the same result.  I thought let me get few more stuff from my car and then call them again. So when I was passing through the front desk on my way to garage I thought of talking to the receptionist. I found no one there. I came out of the hotel and I saw the receptionist smoking and chatting on her mobile!!  Eventually the engineer came and told us that there was a leakage in some duct. So we were moved to another room where the air conditioner was working.  Next; the ice vending machine was not working on our floor. I tried it one floor below and again it was dysfunctional there. So I had to go to the second floor to get some ice.  When we came back to our room next night (after spending the day in an amusement park) we found that the room was not cleaned. The bed sheets were in the same condition when we left in the morning. The trash was not emptied. The shampoo and conditioner were not replaced.  Please don't waste your money here. I will never recommend this hotel to anyone. [REVIEW_10] I would give it zero stars if I could; but yelp obviously doesn't like that. First; if you want to call this dealership the operator acts like the secretary of the CEO; and doesn't want to connect you to talk to anyone. Then she gives you a lecture about how things are handled. She finally connected me; after telling her she can keep the car if this call doesn't get anywhere very soon. Working with Lance was a pleasure. When it came to pick up the car we were informed that due to internal commission problems we would have to receive the car from Tony now as he was the first point of contact even though he wasn't at work or had any part in the deal at any time. Turned out he didn't even know what car we bought. When voicing my displeasure about having to work with someone else; John Hartman; the assistant general manager; just gave a rude answer asking what car we were picking up. Dealing with Crown GMC was a pleasure in the past; but with Hyundai not so much; yet the price made me not walk away at this point. I can only suggest to take your business elsewhere if you expect to be treated with respect. After signing all the paperwork the promised navigation turned out to be non existent. [REVIEW_11] I wish I could say it was not an incredibly unpleasant experience. She was very loud and very rude. [REVIEW_12] Expected better with all the hype. Tastes like bland day old pizza with a rubber crust. And I watched them make it. Perhaps this ""under new management"" thing has something to do with it? [REVIEW_13] When I think about the time I spent waiting for the server to arrive; for a drinkable cup of coffee to replace the one that tasted like it has been brewed with a goat's hoof; and to digest the hard lump of cheese and egg that was my breakfast; I really wish I had chosen instead to stand in the line-up at Sugarbowl. [REVIEW_14] It has been a long time since we ate here. But we were getting tired of the same-old; same-old and the husband suggested we try it again. What a mistake. The place looks old and tired. NO atmosphere. But the service was prompt and friendly. We ordered our meals.... fish and chips for me and an open-faced roast beef sandwich for my husband. My dish arrived with three healthy  pieces of scrod in a very eggy looking breading. Fake fries (you know; reconstituted potato parts shaped like fries) and a very mayonnaise - y tartar sauce. The fish was edible. The fries were not. But the real surprise was the horrendous meal my husband was served. Instead of beautiful roast beef; he received fatty; chewy brisket; shiny gravy and those awful excuses for fries. We should have been suspicious when they offered neither a baked potato nor mashed potatoes. Nevertheless; he dug in. He hated the dish and ate very little of it. The waitress questioned him about it and he said he didn't like it.   She came back to tell us that the meat came from the end of the roast (thus the overcooked texture and heavy fat content). Even as we paid the bill; the owner apologized for serving such a lousy cut of beef. Then why serve it???? It makes no sense. In the meantime; my fish was just passable. Not inedible... but not very good.   They did reduce the bill and gave us a $5 off coupon. But too little too late. If you hurry; you will find the coupon in the entrance to the restaurant.   We won't be back; so you are welcome to use it. Though I wouldn't recommend that you do. [REVIEW_15] Merritt A. saved the day for us!  Earlier in the day; we had someone who ""attempted"" to change out two toilet flanges and flush handles.  This inept person botched the job terribly!  He started leaks; when there were no leaks. When he finally left; we immediate called Lee Company.  They sent out Merritt right away.  Merritt fixed the problems on both toilets right away.  No more leaks; no more problems!  He fixed the nightmare this other private individual created.  Thank you; Merritt!  Call Lee Company - they are true professionals! [REVIEW_16] Having walked almost 30 minutes in the heat; up in arrival I was excited to see the hype of Cemetery #1. The future burial site of Nicholas Cage; the famous voodoo dr-Marie Laveau; and supposedly the evil Madame Lalaurie. But at the front gate was a tour guide demanding that we pay $20 to look. C'mon are you kidding me? To browse; you are going to charge me. Um no thanks. Especially if I walked another 5 min to Cemetary #2 and browsed for FREE. I can understand if they use that money to up keep with the cemetery;  but after peeking in through a side fence; what exactly is the $20 used for? I'm not paying someone to tell me ghost stories that I probably already heard. Thanks but not thanks. [REVIEW_17] OMG!!! I can't believe this kind of service exists!  My husband called to make an appointment for full detailing for next Sat with Michael; he called again to confirm on Fri before we head there since it's a distance from our home.  Michael said he didn't know we wanted to do full detailing thou we specifically mentioned that.  He advised us to come the following sat instead.  We agreed and we reached there at 8am on the following week.  Guess what?  Nobody is at the workshop; it's closed!  We called him and he said he is busy and will call back.. We waited for half an hour in our car and there is still no call from him.  We headed for our breakfast and came back again at 9:30am hoping to give him another chance.  Here comes Alex; his partner opening the shop at 9:30am!  1.5 hours away from our appt time and still no sight of Michael.  Alex tried calling Michael and couldn't get hold of him.  We gave up!!! What a horrendous experience! [REVIEW_18] I called on both days I took my car in to get tinted. The first time I was told to bring it in at 4pm but when I arrived I was told by the owner that he needed a minimum of 3 hours since they needed to remove the old tint and re-tint. I called them again two days later and asked if I could make a appointment. I explained everything that I discussed with the owner to the person on the other end and was told to bring in the car and they would be able to complete it within 4 hours along with a quote.  Once I arrived to the shop I was told the my car would need to be there the entire day and the amount I was quoted pretty much doubled. When I explained the issue to the owner he pretty much blamed me since I didn't make a appointment even when I told him that was the point of the phone call the morning of. I'm not sure if the employees don't communicate properly but they definitely need better communication and customer service skills. [REVIEW_19] The worst!!! We waited in line for 2 hours while they let ppl cut in front of us...when we finally get in...order drinks and food it takes 23 min to get our food..nachos....all bottom of the barrel chips...server says NOTHING!!! ...and still no 2 beers and a marg....never come...I do this for a living...there is no excuse for food to beat drinks...if this is happening the MOD on duty is NOT doing their job helping and backing up the staff....drinks come..we order shots....wrong shots came out not what we ordered...then we get charged for 6 shots!!! Sorry wrong again.... Nothing to fix the problem...then give us the wrong bill!!! We pay bill because obviously we are not here for customer service...and it's a few dollars cheaper...don't think we would have gotten much better. Surprising how a establishment can treat their guests this way and expect them to come back....wait it's a tourist spot so why would they care. Seriously you couldn't last on your guest services...good thing your a ""TRAP"" makes me wonder if our ""stellar"" service is because of poor management and training. Good luck..hate to think a big corporate restaurant like you can take out honest wholesome business with good service and honest and integrity. Never again [REVIEW_20] I received a vase of flowers for Mother's Day and they are terrible. I'm sure my son paid top dollar; because he always does. But this very small bouquet had only three roses that never opened and wilted within two days. The rest of the arrangement was cheap filler flowers. It came in a plain glass vase with dirty water and no bow or ribbon. They forgot the candy that came with it and had to deliver it later in the day. Look elsewhere if you are looking to send an impressive gift; because this one was not.",4
45,"[REVIEW_1] Ordered curried chicken; teriyaki; and some eggrolls with soup...I never got that order  This was my first and last time ordering food from here. Delivery was quick; I'll give them that; but the order was wrong. When I called in they said I can have a free meal on them for the mistake.  I said; okay ""I want that free meal now"" (they also offer free delivery for orders over 12.00$) my food came out to 14.87$; 18.87$ with tip.   They refused multiple times (like it'll make a difference if they bring it now or tomorrow; either way it was a lie to get me off the phone). I informed her that if she didn't send her delivery guy back I'll dispute the amount paid to them with my bank; and they'll lose a new customer.   Normally if one thing in my order was wrong I wouldn't mind at all. It's because my entire order was Wong... [REVIEW_2] Three chances and they are out! We tried to like this place as the location is easy and convenient. The bar is great; the staff friendly; but there is not a dish I have tried that is passable (although the asian shrimp wasn't bad; but very sweet). First visit we wrote off as a new restaurant working out the bugs. On our second visit I ordered a turkey burger and received a dry turkey patty. No one informed me that they were out of buns; but they could have at least tried to dress it up. It was seriously a lone piece of ground meat (to their credit; the manager did comp that meal). Today we received fish and chips that had to come out of a box and chicken salad that could have greased my axles!  We won't be back. [REVIEW_3] I went here with a group of friends during Restaurant Week and it was the complete opposite from what we were expecting. We heard that it was the best crab in Philadelphia; so why wouldn't we want to try it? As one of the guys put it; we felt like we were at ""Bingo Night"" as soon as we walked in. No big deal tho; we had an 8pm reservation and the nine of us arrived about ten minutes early; knowing we would most likely have to wait a little. Nothing prepared us for the 45 minutes of waiting that we ended up standing through. The boys were fine; they went to the bar and made friends with what seemed to be like a regular crowd. When we were finally seated and all decided on our dishes (thank goodness); our server began The Countdown. I have never experienced this before but with every course or round of drinks he would come over and tell us ""Okay guys; about 7 more minutes"" then return a few minutes later and say ""Alright well we have about 3 more minutes left"" and as annoying as it was; he made us all laugh. So it was fine. I ordered the RW special that was salmon stuffed with a crab cake; and it was okay. I would have been fine if the food were on par with a 45 minute wait but it just was not worth it. The best part of the entire experience was the store bought chocolate cake we had for dessert; as they vacuumed around us. [REVIEW_4] Mediocre and expensive. I could not find prices listed anywhere when we ordered. This is also the first place I have ever encountered where a sandwich ""combo"" means with cheese; instead of a side of fries. They also charge you extra if you want gravy on the side. Roast beef ""combo"" was okay. It was tasty but very little meat compared to the HUGE bun. Onion rings were burnt. Fries were terrible. Mozzarella sticks meh. Oh and charged for peppers that I specifically said I didn't want but was given non the less. Will not frequent again; and I would strongly advise you to do the same. [REVIEW_5] I walked in at 9:30 on a Tuesday and the owner told me they were closed. They need to change the hours online and lock the doors when they're closed. [REVIEW_6] The WORST customer service!!! Never going back to any dots diner after this experience. If I could give zero stars that would be too much. [REVIEW_7] New to town and tried several in town but no availability on a Sunday. This place was open when I drove by so I stopped and they had a opening after 20 min wait. Pedicure was ok but gel nails horrible. Looked like fat marshmallow nails and so bumpy. Went to another salon few days later. Run down older salon. Needs lots of improvements especially learn how to do nails. Paid extra for opi nail polish instead of old nail polish they had as a selection. Waste of money and time. [REVIEW_8] Quite disappointed - not in the chain; but certainly in this location. This is the third time in a row we've had problems with our meal. The last caused us not to come back for over a year - and we should have stayed away.  On this Sunday evening; the restaurant was busy; but not jammed. There were five in our party; and we continually had to remind our server about things we were missing before our meals even arrived - butter; silverware sets; refills on beverages...   I ordered a 13oz ribeye; rare; with only squash from the mixed vegetables. When it arrived 20 minutes later; the uneven piece of meat was medium rare on the thick end; and medium to well the rest of the cut - and I had a full serving of mixed vegetables with only one piece of squash. The manager took it to recook the order - and brought back a piece of meat so rare it was cold in the center and tough. I was hungry; so I chomped my way through.  Another steak was over-cooked; a third plate was missing sour cream and butter for a potato; cold shrimp on a fourth; and almost raw (crunchy) vegetables on the fifth.  The manager (Cody) apologized when he took my plate; but never checked back to see if my issue was resolved and for us to tell him about the other problems at the table. When the check arrived - full price. No offer of a dessert for the issues; nothing off the bill.  We will not be back. Jesse's is just a bit up the road; and the quality of both the food and the service are head and shoulders above this Outback.  One shout-out - Kate was great in helping to resolve issues; but she was tied up training someone else and we didn't see her again. [REVIEW_9] the drinks suckkkkkkk!!!!! worst service ever!!!!!! make sure you bring cash. paying with a card; they add a extra charge just for that! never again!!!!!!!!!! [REVIEW_10] disappointed that they wouldn't fill my dogfish head growlers and the beer itself wasn't memorable. [REVIEW_11] While friendly enough; too many mistakes were made for me to ignore. First; I didn't receive my soda; and had to go get my waiter and ask him for it again. Not too big a deal; but then my daughter's chicken enchilada...had no chicken. We'd already begun eating; and our waiter hadn't come around to see if everything was OK. I asked her if she wanted to send it back but she said no; so; fine. The food itself was OK. We were hungry; we ate it. Her kid's meal was around $6.50; my crispy tacos $7.50; and my soda was $2. I noticed the prices on the menu; but wasn't adding up my bill ahead of time or anything because that's; you know; the restaurant's job. So I didn't blink when a check totaling $22.51 came; and I didn't pay any mind about tipping %20 (despite the faults; I've been a server before; so I can understand). In the end I paid $28. It was after we were long gone that I realized the total Should have been closer to $16; not $22.51. Did I get the wrong check and not notice? Did they add gratuity to a teeny little party of two without even telling me? Either way; that's a big no-no; right?  I wasn't being on my toes I guess; but I still feel a little ripped off. Ultimately they received more money than I personally thought the whole experience was worth; hence my poor star rating. Oh; and my butt was on fire all the next day; so there. [REVIEW_12] These people are so RUDE! I will never go there again! They are not helpful and act as though they are too good to help amateur photographers like me! It will be a cold day in hell before they get another dime from me. They need to remember that they are sales clerks and their role is to help the customer! What a bunch of IDIOTS! [REVIEW_13] Horrible experience all the way around. 3 hostesses standing around looking bored; told us 10 min or less to seat us; then 30 some odd minutes later ( because my husband complained there were numerous tables empty and we were the only people at the time waiting) we were seated and treated as if it were a chore for one of them to seat us; talk about being unwelcomed. We also asked about a table for 6 that was empty; as there were 5 of us; and were told that this table was reserved. When I pointed out that I had called prior the day before and was told that there are no reservations; the hostess just starred at me blankly. Once seated; there was a mix up with the wait staff regarding which waiter was to serve us; no big deal. We ordered drinks; an appetizer; and dinner as soon as that was ironed out; and the waiter was pleasant and apologetic. We asked for bread and got it; drinks came soon and we were off to a better start until 30 min later they brought out clams when we ordered raw oysters; when we explained to the food runner that we didn't order clams; he said that they ran out of oysters and clams was all they had. This was an odd explanation; and we sent the clams back of course. My daughter's Caesar salad was overdressed and had large bits of anchovy; so she didn't eat much of it. After waiting for over an hour for dinner (after we had ordered); my grilled shrimp; and rice on the plate arrived to the table cold and half of the shrimp were burnt. I was hungry and tired; it was late; so I just ate the shrimp and rice. The waiter was apologetic for the wait and seemed to be trying very hard. There were two tables that needed to be cleared nearby almost the entire 2 1/2 hours we were sitting there with food all over the floor; it was disgusting. I thought to myself that one of the 3 hostesses should have stepped in to help instead of standing around an empty lobby with a sour look on their faces. It's apparently a training issue for the staff and the kitchen. Everyone else's meal was served warm or hot; so mine must have been prepared an hour or so before everyone else's. My daughter's crab cakes had so much red bell pepper; it was almost as if it was red bell pepper she ordered with a garnish of crab. So; she ate 2 bites and came home hungry. My mom was promised her own small birthday cake (since we were there to celebrate her birthday); but that never arrived; and neither did the manager. We ordered dessert since it was her birthday; but I have to say that the key lime pie was so sour most of us couldn't eat more than just the one bite. Bonefish is so much better; as well as the Shrimp Boat. Brandon could really use another good Seafood restaurant however; but this is not one of them. I can understand that in 6 months or so; they will have their routine down and the staff will be trained with all of the kinks out; but for the high price and low quality of the food we won't be coming back. I have to say that if the food was good; we'd give it another try; but it just wasn't. [REVIEW_14] Absolute garbage company. Trying to get from Indy to Chicago and they are more than an hour late; did not inform me of the delay; and their entire customer policy (feel free to read it on the website) consists of ""we cannot be held responsible for anything."" Sitting at a bus stop with 20 people whom are all having their time wasted with absolutely no recourse. [REVIEW_15] Warning; if you come here on a Sunday there is a set tasting menu.  We were a party of two; they served us with one plate; ""family style"".  The only problem is the woman next to us was a party of one and had the same size servings.  They are claiming family style but giving the same portions they give to one person to multiple people. My advice; make sure you request being served as one person with separate plates.  The food was delicious but the business aspect was unacceptable.  Will not come back. [REVIEW_16] Against my first instinct; we decided to reserve a taxi cab to the airport. Although they were courteous on the phone when we needed the cab earlier; the taxi driver was so rude; cab #6. He didn't answer our greetings; he was driving at 70mph on a 45 zone and he didn't bother to check for road work in his huge GPS ; which led us to take another road and ended up paying more than we expected; he had the nerve to get upset because HE didn't check his route before hand. I didn't care to tip him and I will definitely never use them again. I feel robbed. [REVIEW_17] Poor service and overpriced hookah. Flavors are from star buzz but charge about 30-50% more than most places. They charge for more coals when they burn out. Food wasn't great either. Definitely wouldn't come here again. [REVIEW_18] Cannot vouch for the doctor; as the receptionist was so breathtakingly rude that I didn't even schedule an appointment. They might want to rethink their desk staff if they want to appear welcoming and friendly. [REVIEW_19] In my experience; the staff was a disappointment. We had 3 employees try to take our ""complicated"" order. We just wanted baked salmon with Avocado and cucumber. Which was just a simple customized order. While we were ordering our waitress didn't have the power to take our order. She felt it was to complicated so she just walked away and pass us up to another waitress. In result this restaurant lacks communication and mannerisms. So I wouldn't recommend this place. If your order is to complicated to them; they won't take it. they'll just pass you up to their manager. [REVIEW_20] Awful. We switched years ago to AT&T because of Charter's terrible service; surprise charges; crappy equipment and AWFUL; AWFUL; AWFUL customer service. A salesman showed up at our door the other day saying that things were better and customer service and the company had an overhaul. He promised that the Internet would be faster and better than the one we were using; saying that each device would be connected to 100mb; not every device sharing that 100mb; our cable would be the exact same and we'd have a land line on top of it all for the same price that we were paying with AT&T. Absolute crap! We had the most basic of basic channels and the Internet was MUCH slower than AT&T. We were less than 24 hours in with Charter and attempted to get things corrected. No one would work with us and offered to charge us more to have the same channels we had before. The salesman left his cell number for us to contact him should there be any problem whatsoever and he would correct it immediately. When we attempted to contact the salesman he didn't answer the first time; and anytime after that it went straight to voicemail. Back to AT&T it is.",0
46,"[REVIEW_1] It was easy to work with Preferred Party Rentals for a June graduation party. We browsed their inventory online and placed an online request for quote on the items we were interested in  (tent; tables; chairs; linens; etc.). Then we talked with them on the phone and tweaked the order (they suggested different size tablecloths; etc.). The delivery crew coordinated well with us and quickly set up the tent. Everything was easy; we will absolutely use them again for our next party. [REVIEW_2] I wish I COULD review this restaurant....  I sent 3-4 emails and called 6-7 times to try and  purchase a gift card from this restaurant.  I was contacted more than once with a promise to get back to me or that someone would be available to help - it never happened and I'm sorry to say I had to give up.  I have to believe the food is awesome based on the reviews I've read.  Customer service; not so much. [REVIEW_3] Truly awful! I chose this as my birthday lunch place with a friend. The counter clerk/meal maker was disinterested; bordering on rude. This is a small place; so four dirty; unbussed tables are noticeable. After cleaning our own table; we waited and waited. There was no one ahead of us. Finally our paninis were served: both were badly burned. Who serves burned food; unless you just don't care? The salad was bland. The coffee was fine. [REVIEW_4] Unless you planned on being robbed of thousands go somewhere else.  I've had continuous problems w a power steering on my impala for going on 2 years. 1st time they cldnt fix it right and went back and paid them double to re-do the job. In the process after I got my car back I noticed my hood looked funny. They broke a connector piece that holds the bumper to the frame. They refused to fix it. Power steering bad again after a second time. I attempted to sue but I wrongfully filed in greenfield when I sld of in marion.  I'm young didn't know that. All my parts and service is under warranty. So point blank they're still responsible for my car. Took it back up and they Rudely refused to do any work on my car cuz I did try and sue them. So I literally spent around $4k just for nothing.  These ppl lied to me over and over.  And they obviously don't know how to do any work. I was personally told not to go here because they would charge too much. I understood that but I  figured I'd rather go here than a old beat up service place. I figured I cld trust a dealership.  I figured I cld get the job done right.  I was wrong. I hope no 1 has to deal w what I have.  You need and service done to your vehicle I'd strongly suggest you take you business somewhere else. Or you'll be sorry.  I find it funny when I'm told we couldn't come to an agreement.  I was point blank told  #1 no we're not fixing it again. Even though it is under warranty.  #2 no your not getting your money back. [REVIEW_5] Had brunch here yesterday. Nice relaxing time but terrible food.  Eggs looked and tasted like they had been held for a while after being cooked; not at all fresh. Salad on one plate had more dressing then salad; really inedible. What I did notice was the complete lack of bacon or sausage or anything pork related. Odd for a brunch; but maybe gypsies don't eat meat? The other thing I found was 1. It was 40 degrees in the bathroom; really really cold. 2. The wall next to our table really needed painting; or at least washing; food splatters and grease stains on the paint were really unappealing. The cute puffy wall coverings looked like someone used them as napkins over and over.  A tremendous disappointment after many really great experiences at Southern Cross.  It seems to me they can do a lot better; or close the place for a rehab.  We felt pretty ripped off with brunch; though the live music was awesome. Maybe dinner is better; breakfast is really hard to do well after all but I doubt we will ever find out as we have no intention of returning. In fact we cancelled our Valentine's Day reservation after this experience. Conshy girls up your game. [REVIEW_6] We've been hearing of a new menu in the works for months since the much-ballyhooed original chef who developed the current one apparently didn't work out. The current kitchen staff executes the current menu rather badly. Chipotle shrimp tacos were bland and missing ingredients promised on the menu. At breakfast at least the waiter (one he showed up at breakfast) was honest in admitting that the salmon was no longer house-smoked as the menu says. Respect your customers enough not to lie to them on an easily corrected paper menu. Corned beef hash was more like chili; swimming in a sea of greasy broth in a bowl. Will give it one more strike if they get around to a new menu before improving. [REVIEW_7] I've been to many art museums and was surprised to see a museum this beautiful with such a great collection to be FREE! I was so happy to have had discovered this museum in my short time in Indianapolis. I loved the African Art and the Modern Art sections (although I did make a mistake taking out my camera for the Modern Art museums.. that's a no no). The outdoor sculpture garden and gift shop was awesome as well. Highly recommended! [REVIEW_8] I asked for a manicure gel nail and this is what I get. The paint is so sloppy and  did not clean around my nail whatsoever . I had to paid $40 for this; never going back there. [REVIEW_9] Two things I can not believe; 1) That I am doing an updated review on a gas station and 2) that I am raising them to a 5 Star rating.  However; I am doing it because they deserve it.   As Christine stated in her review; the customer service here is outstanding. Everyone of the employees I have meet are friendly; out going and helpful. It is like they all take Pollyanna pills before their shift.  It is so good to see people enjoying their work and spreading a little happiness. You do know that stuff is contagious. If not stop by this U Gas and you will see customers come in with a frown and walk out with a smile and they didn't even have to pay for it. Smiles are free.   The store is always super clean. The booze is super cheap. I can  get my Scotch; vodka and beer here at a savings when I do not have time to make the pilgrimage out to Costco. Their selection and variety of convince store staples have also saved my ass numerous times already.  They also sell me winning Scratch Lottery Tickets. I am hoping for a big win on Mega and Power some day.   Their prepared foods are done by Gigi and the selection and variety is better then their competitor QT. I've tried the salads; a couple of the sandwiches and I like the way the also package fresh fruits and cubed cheeses for snacking.  My only draw back on the prepared foods is that they do not have the little box that gives you the Nutrition Facts. Being a dieter; I like to have that information at my fingertips.   Be alert in the parking lot; as this place has gotten popular the parking lot has gotten a little crazy.  Everyone rushing in for affordable gas; winning lottery tickets; cheap booze and great customer service makes for a parking lot derby. [REVIEW_10] Very bad service and i took one month for rent; so they charged different types of taxes and extra fees. Finally they charge for tolls but all the tolls i only paid I didn't use ezpass. Budget is the worst rental service and i took car from different place [REVIEW_11] I went here for happy hour and I have looking to find great happy hour locations close to where I live. My friends insisted on going and couldn't believe I hadn't been there yet. I will be going back frequently! The happy hour food was inexpensive yet so flavorful and filling. I was beyond satisfied and can't wait to go back! I will be ordering the calamari; the flatbread pizza and the olives again. They don't let you order happy hour food for take out; but I did order an extra pizza and then took left overs home for later; and it was just as delicious later as it was when it first came out. As a group we ordered one of everything on the happy hour menu then when there was something we wanted more of; we ordered another one. The wine is 3 dollars a glass and the beer is 2.50. You can't beat the prices; especially for around here. I could not believe how amazing the food and wine choices were. I usually think that inexpensive food won't be very good; which deters me from happy hours; but I can't wait to go back and I can't wait to try dinner there as well. I highly recommend this restaurant. [REVIEW_12] New Orleans use to be all about service. My wife and I were running a few minutes late because our 1 year old needed to be changed right as we left the house. Mr B's would not seat my father until we arrived. It is time for Mr B's to get with the times. [REVIEW_13] TERRIBLE FOOD TERRIBLE SERVICE! I never complain; but had to warn others... The place looked nice; till we got our waiter who was apparently an american coach from Brooklyn lol.... He repeatedly shoved at us the 2 most expensive meals on the menu even though we just wanted tacos. The tacos were the size of half dollars and bare.  Highly disappointing and both my boyfriend and I were sick all night. [REVIEW_14] Oh; Heck No! We ordered 2 pizzas tonight: one new hand tossed and one thin and crispy. And I do use the word crispy lightly. Both these pizzas were limp and soggy. When we lifted the pieces from the boxes the tips pointed straight down at the table--and not because of the weight of the ingredients. Those were just ordinary. But; this thin and ""crispy"" crust was very crispy on the very outer edge; but wallpaper paste everywhere else. The hand tossed is a new product and I thought maybe they just hadn't gotten it perfected yet. It also was soggy and did a nose-dive to the table when lifted. Unfortunately; it was already after nine pm when they arrived and we decided to just eat what we could and call it a night. But; I thought about it and decided that maybe they didn't know and if everyone was silent; they would lose business and people would have bad experiences. So; I called and spoke to David; who identified himself as the manager on duty. I told him we had gotten pizza and that I just wanted to give him some feedback. He was very nice; polite and pleasant. I liked him. Until. Until he said that he had pulled up my order and that there were 6 toppings on one pizza and 9 toppings on the other pizza and so with so many toppings; it's hard for them to know how long to cook the pizzas. I thought about that a second and asked; ""so it's my fault for ordering too many toppings""? He said no and then explained again that with that many toppings it's too hard to judge how long to cook the pizzas. I told him then it should say on the website (I ordered online) that they don't recommend more than however-many toppings. He explained the problem to me again and I told him Dominos can cook a crispy pizza crust perfectly--and do a pretty good hand tossed; too. I said maybe I should call them and find out how to do it and call him back and tell him. I mean; how ridiculous! I asked for nothing comped; nothing like that. I was just giving the feedback and ended up being a bit flip with him and sitting here typing this because I'm mad instead of sleeping. With delivery and tip; I paid $30 for food that was barely eaten and will probably be thrown away in a few days. It'll dry out in the refrigerator; so maybe I can have it crispy after all. What idiocy.  I told him the Yelp review would be up in about an hour; so ""Hi; David!"" and I contacted corporate; too. [REVIEW_15] The reviews weren't all that positive; but I wanted to give the restaurant a try anyhow because you can sometimes find a diamond in a dive. I won't be returning ever... Although if up to my 2 year old daughter we'll come every day to see the fish. There is a huge Koi pond with fish feed you can purchase to feed them at the entrance. Not sure what the fish had to do with the overall theme since the ceiling is blue with sparkle like glittery cast over it.   The food was nothing to write home about and nor were the desserts semi frozen spinning in the glass display case. I really wanted to like the place even though my husband gave up on the spot; but the deal breaker was no hand soap in the entire women's restroom to wash my hands. The sign clearly states ""ALL EMPLOYEE'S MUST WASH HANDS"" how? I couldn't... [REVIEW_16] Horrible!  I heard good things about this salon and went in last year before vacation for a gel mani and regular pedi.  I purchased my own tools so that I didn't have to worry about contamination from other feet.  The technicians kept using old files and buffers despite the fact that I paid for my own tools (and purchased them from their salon).  When I tried to tell them I had my own; they didn't understand (language barrier) and I had to keep calling over the manager.  I did not want to seem annoying but I also did not want to get an infection.  Well.....  My gel mani chipped within 2 days of being on vacation and I got a fungal infection on two of my toe nails.  NEVER; EVER again!  I never go to nail salons for this exact reason and not I am stuck with fungus.  Please do not go to this nail salon. [REVIEW_17] I've walked past here several times and loved what I saw in the window. Finally we had some time to stop today. I popped in and within 3 minutes I found two nice summer dresses! As I approached an attendant; she told me that they had a ""no backpack rule."" And that I would have to give her my purse so she could leave it on the counter. By the door. Unattended. When I told her I was not comfortable with that; she shrugged. Whelp; I'm not about to spend money on a place that treats me like a criminal for no reason. So I put the dresses that I was going to try on down and walked out. Time to hit up etsy.  Tldr; rude staff; don't bother with this place. [REVIEW_18] Service was...wait what service?! We were disregarded for 15 minutes after asking for service. While the quality and atmosphere may have been wonderful the service was an absolute disappointment. Save your money for those that appreciate your patronage. [REVIEW_19] love this place! The owners are 3 brothers right from Sicily. They keep their pizzas as genuine and traditional as possible.  You can't go wrong with a plain pie; but if you'd like a change I'd recommend the Margherita; Trenton; or buffalo!   As far as non-pizza items I recommend: the Rambino (spinach salad) or chicken melt panini (also can be made as a wrap with fries.  Workers are friendly and fast. Other reviews have really put the girls down but they work hard to get the pick-out customers in and out and home to enjoy their food!   FYI; I've learned that the tip jar goes to men; not the girls at the counter. Both deserve tips; just be aware of who you're tipping!  This place is worth a try- you'll be hooked!  NOTE: other Spatola's (there's about 10) were previously owned by these owners but have been sold. Besides the name; they are no long we affiliated with this location. Their Chalfont location is their only one; and this one has the most genuine taste of Sicily. [REVIEW_20] I really don't bother with negative reviews; but this time an exception has to be made.  I'd like to follow up on Elsa H.'s review of this place; since I was a member of the family being threatened with police action over trying to purchase a lamp.  I've visited this store many times (it's only a few blocks from our house--we live in the Garden District / Irish Channel); and have had no small share of weird or rude encounters.  Previously; it was decidedly unfriendly looks from the staff; noting encounters with patrons who wanted to keep their purses rather than surrender them at the front counter; etc.  I continued to visit; however; because there's a certain sort of eclectic ""junk pile"" vibe here and some genuinely interesting stuff. This time; the epic unfriendliness of the staff was directed squarely at us; however.  One detail omitted from the previous description of this encounter is when Elsa tried to diffuse the situation with the female owner; the husband (?); rather than trying to also diffuse the situation and (perhaps?) sell something; immediately not only made the ""tell the police to hurry up"" remark  but also tried to throw additional and unrelated fuel on the fire; and blame the kids for breaking things.  Since they were picking vintage comic books for purchase with me; in a different area of the store; and the lamp was on a high shelf elsewhere; that's a little hard to digest.  I'd also like to reinforce how nice it was to have other patrons who were also going to buy things simply leave the store and follow us next door to La Davina (highly recommended gelato) to discuss what happened.  If you're visiting New Orleans and looking for antiques; I strongly encourage you to check out the other offerings on Magazine St.  If you're a local; I think it's obvious that except possibly as an anti-gentrification move; we really don't want a visitor's experience on the otherwise fantastic Magazine St. stretch to include this sort of abuse.  And finally; if you're considering consigning your merchandise to be sold by this store; I encourage you to first be an observant ""customer""; and decide if you believe anything will actually be sold at all; given the attitude of the owners.  There are better choices.   Please don't support this horrible store.  And in summary; it's unfortunate that Yelp doesn't allow zero-star reviews.",5
47,"[REVIEW_1] I have been in the industry a long time and this is one of the best places I have ever been to.  The menu is great (and super reasonably priced); the wine list is phenomenal; and the service was superb.  Moreover; the atmosphere was beautiful. I would recommend this place to anyone. Specifically on Wednesdays; they have half off all bottles of wine including their reserve list! Insane deal! Happy dining! [REVIEW_2] Good bagels; but they can NEVER get an order right.  We live in NJ so when you ask for Taylor Ham and cheese you think they would be able to handle this.    Instead I get a ham and cheese sandwich; or an egg; ham and cheese sandwich.  I am DONE with this place.  City Market or Lumberville General Store will be my two choices from here on out. [REVIEW_3] This is a place you would usually just pass by but don't; the pho is to die for! The broth is so flavorful! [REVIEW_4] I LOVE Katies.   This is a neighborhood locals place with a serious chef and a great menu.  I've been there at least 6 times.    Definitely have the grilled oysters.   The veal with a marsala cream sauce over pasta is one of my faves.  You can create your own pasta ingredients and there have to be 15 or 20 choices.   The po boys are great too.   The same goes for the pizza.  I'm from Chicago and I'm a snob on pizza.  This is the best pizza in NOLA.  The ingredients are super fresh in everything that they make.  It's a great sauce; quality cheese; etc.   They were the only place where I had a pizza that was perfect.   I had sausage; shrimp; and red peppers on my pizzas.   Pizza in the south generally has a doughy crust.  In Chicago; the only pizza you'll get like that is a $5 pizza pizza or pizza hut.    Katie's was the only place where I got a great pizza with a crispy thin crust.   It was the only pizza that stood up to my faves at home.   If it's nice; sit at the 10 or so tables outside.  After a few visits; they welcomed me and my dog as family.   Say hi to Murphy; he took great care of me. [REVIEW_5] Only had one experience with this place and it will be my last. I called in the night before to ask if they sell deboned duck and the man on the phone said they could but I would have to request it the day of. I called the following morning to ask to pick up a plain deboned duck and whoever the incompetent girl who answered had trouble getting my order clear. I picked up my order and came home to find that not only did they gave a whole duck with stuffing I never asked for. I called the place back and thy never offered any compensation of any sort except a trade in right as it's a hour before dinner time and the butcher shop is more than thirty minutes away for me. Shame that food from this place is overshadowed by their terrible customer service. [REVIEW_6] The nachos were seriously disgusting... Probably the grossest food I've had in a long time. The waitress was rude; unresponsive; and had a bad attitude. I will not return. [REVIEW_7] Super! In every way. Just attended the Blueberry Festival. Had a special steak sandwich and blueberry tart. Home made chips. Excellent and service rarely seen. Thanks! [REVIEW_8] I have a 2011 C300 Mercedes.  My serpentine belt was squeaking and I needed a new battery.   I still had the original battery in my car.  They replaced the belt and gave me a new battery.  The owner is Bill and his son is Jon.  Jon is the one that worked on my car.  I am very happy that I found this place.  They saved me money by me not having to go to the Mercedes Dealer. [REVIEW_9] Great great breakfast... Start to finish! Candied pecan smoked bacon; sweet cream pancakes and Fleur die lis omelet!!!! [REVIEW_10] Horrible experience tonight our service never checked on us. We had to ask the host for boxes; napkins drinks etc. Plus our food was cold. The ribs were burnt or over cooked. The food would have been good if it was warm. Ciara was able to give us complementary cornbread [REVIEW_11] The only place in Tucson I let wax my eyebrows! I always go to Jennifer and she is amazing. She selects an eyebrow shape that is most complimentary to your face using different stencils. Then she carefully sculpts them using hard wax; not strips. This is so much better for your skin! They do an absolutely amazing job; and for only $20! [REVIEW_12] Great little place tucked along side the French Market.  GREAT baked oysters!  My wife had the shrimp salad and said it was amazing. [REVIEW_13] Excellent healthy options for NOLA dining with lots of to go choices. I had turkey meatballs and spaghetti. It is a wonderful lunch place. [REVIEW_14] My wife and I have a specific location we go to in VA.  Whenever we ""cheat"" on them; we are always disappointed.  However; on our recent trip to Tampa; our host said this place was good from what she heard.  After looking at the reviews from a few spots in the area; we decided to give it a try for my wife's birthday.    One thing I will say is that this place is expensive!  So is our spot in VA.  However; we felt we got our monies worth here.  We waited about 10min or so and we were seated (it was a Thursday night).  Our waiter was Lou.  From the time we sat down to the time we paid; he kept us laughing.  I forgot our chef's name but he was awesome as well.    The food was great!  I didn't expect the noodles which was a plus.  I also ordered Supreme California Rolls and my friend ordered something else.  Both were up to par with my standards.    For the main meal; the steak; chicken and shrimp was cooked perfect!  The yum yum sauce I'm used to isn't as watery but it was still good.    I did order 2 Sake Bombs and when asked if I ever done one; I said I sure have back home in VA.  Lou said we haven't done one FL style..lol.  Lou then got everyone together to chant along (2 tables) as we did the Sake bomb.  We made a mess but Lou was there with replacement napkins.  He also got everyone at the table to sing happy birthday to my wife which was cool.  Then again the people at our table were cool to begin with.  Overall; I loved this place.  It was pricey but well worth it in my books.  If you ever go; ask for Lou as your waiter.  You WILL NOT be disappointed with him. [REVIEW_15] I've now tried quite a few of these strange donuts and all have been delicious and interesting.  A few favorites: The strange bacon; iDonut; and the fritters!   This isn't your typical donut shop so if you're bothered by unique ingredients; friendly faces; colorful decor; or reviving a great neighborhood; don't shop here! [REVIEW_16] The donair meat was very cheap tasting....like it came out of a can or something gross.   The place looks run down.  We won't be back.  People who think this is the best donair have lived a very sheltered life in the land of donairs!  This is probably one of my worst ones! [REVIEW_17] Needed a battery for my Lexus.  Drove over to AutoZone in Roxborough at 9 am Sunday morning.  Easy transaction; had the new battery installed within minutes!  Thank you for getting my car back on the road again! [REVIEW_18] We travel 20 minutes from our home in East Germantown to get pizza and wing dings from Slices. Both my husband and I are not Philadelphia natives; and we find most Philly pizza appalling; but Slices gets the job done! They also make delicious buffalo chicken cheesesteaks! Yum Yum! [REVIEW_19] After looking at other reviews on Yelp; I had to come here! I also noticed seating seemed limited; but we decided to go at an off hour (even then it was still busy; but we managed to snag a table).   I will say every review that cites this place as being slow in service is spot on - it is slow. I don't think the kitchen is well organized to be honest; and they don't encourage take out orders; which is why they are always so full.   We ordered two lunch combos; one with a Figo pizza; and a caprese salad; the other with a Margherita pizza and a caesar salad. For the beverage we both got the unsweetened iced tea (I wish they had better beverage options!).   The pizzas were both amazing and perfectly balanced; on par with Pizzeria Bianco (though I say Pizzeria Bianco is just a little better). The salads were delicious; but my husband was a little off put by the piece of anchovy on top (on the caesar). Then there was this crusty bread that was complimentary with olive oil (to die for).   At the end of the meal we were given a tiny spoonful of the gelato; I was given sweet cream; my husband hazelnut. We thought the gelato was delicious; but quite frankly we were completely out of room. I think they should lead the visit with a gelato sample (or do a special with dessert OR salad)! Maybe next time!   Overall; I would say the food was excellent; service was ok; but slow and the prices were reasonable! They do need a larger dining room with more staff and a better layout! Time to expand! [REVIEW_20] I am a regular at this Scotty's location.  I have been to all but one Scotty's (Bloomington); and this one is the cleanest and the friendliest.  The manager always comes over to greet us; and he and my pop go at it over what school is better purdue or IU.  It's great for him to have someone like that to nit pick with.  There is a kids place as well.  I don't recommend you sit over there if you are trying to hear the game; or your partner.  I love this place.  I rave about it to friends about how much better it is than downtown; 96 or even three wise.  One gripe...the French press coffee would be much better if you ground the beans more coarse.  My mom always gets grounds in her cup...even after waiting the recommended time.  If you did that; it would be perfect!  Thanks!",15
48,"[REVIEW_1] Wasn't that busy they might have had 4 servers on. Our server took forever to get us CANNED BEERS; we NEVER GOT OUR WATERS. Our appetizer came AFTER we finished our food. They comped it; but didn't try to make amends about the rest of horrible experience. We will NEVER GO BACK. [REVIEW_2] Great breakfast place - got the Benedict and substituted out the bacon for avocado. Flavor was on point. Will Probably swapped out toast for English muffin. [REVIEW_3] Come here to have drinks made by a bartender who doesn't care about the integrity of their craft!  What seems like a great cocktail program executed by amateurs. Came in the evening of 01/01/18 and ordered a drink that was a floral riff on the Last Word. After straining my drink into the glass; my bartender exchanged baffled looks with his barback and poured gin directly into the glass. I'm not stupid; so I asked what the ingredient was and why he added it after the fact. ""It's lavender Gin and I didn't put enough."" Well; my friend; this resulted in an improperly diluted and room temperature 'cocktail'. I even mentioned that it was not as cold as it should have been and the solution was to add ice to my coupe glass. COME ON. At what point is it appropriate to ask to jump behind the bar and just make your drink yourself?  Just because half the people in NoLA don't know the difference between a good drink and a hole in the ground isn't an excuse to be lazy. Do it right or go home. [REVIEW_4] Safelite is the best!  They did a far better job than the last place I went to get a chip in my windshield fixed (another glass shop on Kolb).  I went into the shop on Kolb in the  morning without an appt and they took me immediately and got me out in 30 minutes.  The gentleman who looked at my windshield; checked me in and fixed the chip was the Quality Manager; David Haclerode; and he was the epitome of professionalism and was so incredibly nice and knowledgeable.  They even vacuumed my floor boards and washed the outside of all my windows!  While I waited; I watched TV they have there and enjoyed a complimentary bottle of chilled water.  I'm super impressed with the whole operation.  They made it seamless; quick and efficient.  I'm recommending Safelite to my family and friends.  In fact; I wouldn't even consider going anywhere else for a windshield chip fix! [REVIEW_5] Our first time is our last time.  Worst margaritas we've had anywhere.  What Mexican restaurant can't make a good margarita??  Each of our meals was boring and unauthentic.  My burrito came wrapped in a piece of foil served on a plate (felt like I had hit a drive thru).   No sides...just one chicken burrito for $9.99.   When we tried to use our $3 off $15 coupon we were told we couldn't use it.  Really?  After spending almost $50 on three regular margaritas and two entrees (no appetizers and no desserts and yes it cost that much).   Extremely overpriced; poor service; boring food. [REVIEW_6] This place is a joke. Never going there again. No concept of customer service at all. Food is mediocre at best. [REVIEW_7] Literally; the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to. The restaurant is filthy; the service is awful; and they didn't make any of our order correctly; and really; how hard is that?  I won't be back and if I were you I would find a different place to go. [REVIEW_8] This moving company should never even be in business. Our Apartments had to be renovated their company got the bid. They did such a poor job of packing there was damaged items all over the place they put food and liquids and the electronic items they were not shrink-wrapped!! A ton of my moving boxes were missing  as were a lot of the other tenants  they put things like my personal ladder outside where they left it and the construction company was using it instead of in my house where it should have been becuz it belonged to me... A ton of of my boxes and items were missing and I'm assuming other tenants got them and the same thing happened to other tenants... we were told we had to file a claim and we had to have  proof which whennyou have a bunch of stuff in your in the middle of packing and moving you don't think to take a complete inventory of your items so you're just basically Sol and they probably know that... It's pretty pathetic. It made my move just a wonderful experience!!! extra sarcasm added.. I would say definitely use at your own risk they are not worth it I don't care if they were paid $1000000 or $1 they sucked. The gentleman that came back to help unpack were nice but everything was packed in different boxes like three different rooms were packed in 1/2 box part of 1/4 was packed in one box part of another dark in the same box on and on.. There was no Rhyme or Reason to any of their packing skills... their training was pathetic everything was pathetic.  It was an extremely poor experience frustrating and I would not recommend them to anybody as I said they should not even be in business.  If I would have been able to pack my own stuff I would have had a professional style job done myself... there was no organizational skills with this company... there was no planning nothing. I'm not sure what happened but it was piss poor planning and piss poor execution. Extremely disappointed extremely frustrated and Will NEVER Ever ever recommend this company. I feel our property management company should receive a fulandl refund that wasn't even a job sort of done... I believe they even had an extra apartment that had overflow because all the boxes weren't in the appropriate places as they should have been.  All in all nice is fine..but it dznt cut the mustard. 2 thumbs down definitely !!!!!! It appears they walked but do not talk the talk. This was the first moving company I've ever had to use and it doesn't give me good faith in moving companies. I have an extremely bitter taste in my mouth and it is there for a reason. [REVIEW_9] Literally one of the best meals I have had in the quarter!  Shrimp n grits is one of my favorite things to eat in the South...their version cannot be topped.  Can't wait to come back here. [REVIEW_10] Wasn't an exceptional experience. Wife is a diabetic; so she attempted to avoid the ingredients that would cause issues.  So she went the ""steamed"" route.  The grill hadn't been cleaned between courses; and there was a palatable taste that just seemed incorrect.  All in all; we won't be going back. [REVIEW_11] My boyfriend and I went for dinner on a Friday night. We sat at the chef's bar which allows you to see the food being prepared in the open kitchen. It was fun to watch until we noticed that one of the cooks was tasting the food with a spoon then continuing to use the spoon to cook the food. He did this with every dish he cooked; reusing the same dirty spoons to taste; stir; and serve everyone's food. We reluctantly ate our food anyway. It was tasty; but we both got sick the next day. Will never go there again. I would have said something to the head chef; but he was present in and around the kitchen the entire time; so I had to assume he saw this too and did not care. [REVIEW_12] I am giving this restuarant one star because we did not dine there. We attempted to though. We showed up on a Saturday night about 8:30 pm. The parking lot was full but we did not see a line or anything to look like there was a wait. When we walked inside the music downstairs was so loud it sounded like a Salsa club. There was no host to greet us. Finally a man came up to us and told us they were booked for the night and that there was ""going to be a long wait"". Uh okay... He did mention we were welcomed to sit at the end of the bar if we wanted to. Who wants to eat a nice dinner at the end of a bar?   We will not be back to try to eat here. [REVIEW_13] Previously; I had rated this restaurant with four stars. However; after today's horrible experience; I can barely even give it a one star. The waitress was fine. The rest; just the worst experience I have ever had at a brunch; the absolute worst! There were seven of us who waited and waited and waited for our food while others who came in after us ordered; ate and left. After an hour and 15 minutes; one of the people in our party had to leave and cancelled her order. The waitress told us they hadn't started on any of our orders at that point. Unbelievable!!!! I told the waitress I was extremely dissatisfied with the situation snd told her to share that with the manager. Truly THE WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE.  I have no intention of ever going back there. [REVIEW_14] Only giving a 1 because there is nothing lower!!! Angie Gave me the worst haircut I've ever had!!! I came in with 2 photos of the cut I wanted came out with my hair looking NOTHING like the photos!!  Even when pointed out to her she didn't not pay attention to what she was doing.  Came out basically having a mans flattop!  Would never go to this place again!!! Nothing like going into the Holidays with a crappie haircut. Thank you!! Angie and Regis Hair salon!! [REVIEW_15] One of their guests went on a rampage and started punching random people; knocking one to the ground.  I told the bartender to call security; then I restrained the assailant as efficiently as humanly possible; causing no injuries; no striking; basically a bear hug; until security finally arrived.  Instead of a thank you I was told to go to my room or I would be trespassing--- fine; Did they look at the video and figure it out? Make it right later?  No.  I was treated poorly; and when I called days later; I got no response.  Spoke with Art in Security; and no call back.   Not  the way to treat someone who helped you out.   I will not be going back to Peppermill. [REVIEW_16] 2 hours I'll never get back. Waited for the food for an hour before the bartender came back and asked if I ordered something I had not. Clearly had not even put my order in. Another hour wait to close my tab. My drink was refilled once in this 2 hour time period. The food was actually good; but wasting 2 hours of my day in an atmosphere (terribly loud at 11am) I couldn't wait to leave was far from pleasant. [REVIEW_17] Amazing pizza. AMAZING! After my first bite; I felt like that Oprah Winfrey meme; where her head is thrown back; her mouth is agape and her arms are open wide; and she's screaming; ""You get a car!"" Except it's not Oprah; it's me. And I don't get a car -- I get a pizza. But I felt that excited.    This is basically the pizza I have been looking for since moving to the Indianapolis area. It's a whole lot of nothing: It's not cut into square pieces. It's not crispy and thin. It's not redolent of oregano. It's thick and chewy; cheesy; greasy; wonderful -- it tastes the way pizza is supposed to taste! I have found my new pizza home. [REVIEW_18] If you are looking to go somewhere where customer service is not a priority; this is your place. Extremely rude and unprofessional waitresses. Every other place on Broadway had accommodating waitstaff. Highly disappointed in the lack of training that seems to be happening in a place that has potential. [REVIEW_19] We wanted to pick up some Zima and a male employee was very nice and said they were sold out and Zima is sold out everywhere in town. So he helped us pick out something he said will be similar but turns out grocery stores and Walmart have Zima. Lies. Oh; and P.S. Mr. Man; Truly Lime and Midori tastes nothing like Zima and Midori so thanks for that too. [REVIEW_20] Could not get service. I was pass over service twice for customers that ordered was taken immediately after being seated. When I bought to the hostess; that I was at lunch and was pass over. She told that I would have to wait because they was busy.",4
49,"[REVIEW_1] I'm big on natural; great tasting; organic food; which is why I come here whenever I'm in Florida. Everything I've had here (vegetarian) has been amazing; and the meat dishes my friends order never disappoint. The popovers are amazing; the spinach & chocolate smoothie is a meal in itself. Come here. Often. [REVIEW_2] I went to LA smoke on Thursday afternoon we had to poke rib coleslaw and fries when the rib came out the first time they was Cold send them back they came out hot but they tasted horrible [REVIEW_3] We don't eat at KFC very often. I had the lame idea of trying it again. First off; the cashier; Michelle; had a SERIOUS attitude problem. Rude as the day is long. No smile; no hello; no thank you. Looked like she really hated her job. We told her our food was dine-in. It was put in a to go bag; no plates; butter; sporks; etc. I didn't dare ask for plates. Chicken was under-cooked. Slaw and potatoes were OK. Biscuits fair. Are we going back? NOPE!!! Bad attitudes don't fare well with me. [REVIEW_4] Looking for something tasteless; greasy; and overpriced?! Head on over to George's Sandwich Shop! What a disaster. The roast pork sandwich is listed as $7.00; fine; but any sandwich-eater worth their salt (or pepper) knows that a sandwich isn't complete without some toppings; and George's sticks it to you ever-so-casually: ""Anything on that?"" Unsuspecting customers will be charged on top of the $7 for what should be basic; included toppings. This would be acceptable if the sandwich had any semblance of decency; yet it is completely revolting from first glance to last choked bite.The bread was completely soggy and drenched in oil that was hot enough to burn my hand. The pork was entirely flavorless; the provolone and broccoli rabe couldn't even save it. I regret wasting my appetite on this disgrace of a sandwich. Do yourself a favor and go down the street to Paesano's instead. [REVIEW_5] My partner and I were out of towners for a wedding; which took place at Spasso's. It was such a good spot for a wedding dinner. The space was open; staff accommodating to our needs; we enjoyed the food and our glasses never ran empty. You could've rolled us out of there after our 5-course meal! [REVIEW_6] Great food! I had ordered 4 for on the road and request the veggie in a different bag and in toasted it. This way you can toast it at home if you live 2 hours away like me! Had three there with a few friend. Must try the shaved ice it's amazing!!! Friendly and good service do not serve other people before you based on ethnicity like thuy cafe down the street. [REVIEW_7] Delicious! Best place around for ice cream . Everything is made fresh from cows without hormones and antibiotics . It's cash only; but it's worth the trip to the ATM. [REVIEW_8] Butch did a great job. The tour was relaxing; informative but 2 good stops to eat and see the cemetery. I recommend going on this trip the beginning of your stay so you know where to go during your trip. He'a also pretty fun. [REVIEW_9] Very Informative; took us to haunted places (that we were planning to see anyways) and gave us funfilled stories behind each place. Kept us listening all night! [REVIEW_10] Find another pharmacy!  I have had bad experience after bad experience at this pharmacy.  First; they are incredibly slow.  There's often a long line of cars at the drive through window.  Even when there are no customers at the pharmacy counter inside; they seem to take a break between cars; making everyone wait for no reason whatsoever.  Recently; I went to pick up a prescription I have been taking for years.  After I paid; but before she handed me my medicine; the woman told me I had to wait and talk to the pharmacist.  I explained that I had the flu and that I had been taking that medication at that dosage for years and I really didn't want to wait for the pharmacist.  I just wanted to get home before I threw up again.  She told me it would be illegal for her to give me the medicine without talking to the pharmacist.  That is a bold faced lie.  It may violate Walgreens's policy; but it is not illegal.  Ask an attorney or any non-Walgreens pharmacy.  Finally; I was prescribed two medicines that cannot be taken together.  This Walgreens filled both prescriptions; repeatedly.  When I found out about the potentially deadly interaction between the two medicines; I pointed it out to the pharmacist very politely.  First; he had no idea those medicines were contraindicated.  Second; he acted like it was no big deal at all.  He never said sorry or we'll look into it or anything.  He just said something like; ""So you want me to take X medication off automatic refill?""  I was shocked.  I left a message for Walgreens to complain about that issue; but I never got a return call.  Time to find another pharmacy. [REVIEW_11] What a fun little find. Busy first thing in the morning! Our server was spunky and fun; just the right amount of perfect service.   My husband was starving and grumpy after our red eye flight in from Cali; this was the perfect meal to perk him right up!   I ordered plain crepes with powdered sugar; they were thick unlike an ordinary crepe which was a little weird but; none the less delicious. I topped them off with some cinnamon-cream syrup. My husband enjoyed a meaty man omelet with a side of cinnamon and sugar pancakes.   The portions are just right. Totally worth the extra 10 min drive from the airport. [REVIEW_12] Small; crowded and hectic but boy the food was good and plentiful. Wait staff was right on top of the chaos. Great breakfast place. [REVIEW_13] Would it be weird if I wanted to move in and permanently live here!? The style of this salon is impeccable. The color palette and decor they chose makes it feel like you're in a Restoration Hardware magazine...in France...surrounded by heirloom antiques. I didn't know what to expect when arriving but I was pleasantly surprised with their upscale polish options like Chanel and many others I actually didn't know I needed in my life until I arrived.  Service was prompt and I especially enjoyed the extended massage. Most importantly the tools she used were brand new/ had been sterilized. I watched her open the fresh package up; that made me feel good about cleanliness and safety. I don't know if all nail salons have cute gold tips on their nail trimmer tools but now I want them for my own collection.   I picked a gray color for my toes and did OPI Funny Bunny gel on my nails. So far I'm loving both!  So nice to see a high end nail salon finally making its way to Nashville. I've gone to others in Nashville that seem to be high end; but it just ends up like a VIP club on the Vegas strip with loud music and sparkles just waiting for a Justin Bieber song to come on.  CURED was not only high end; but it was classic. Like The Hamptons type of classic but with a comfortable low key brunch with girlfriends mimosa type of vibe. I think it would be amazing for a bridal party with so many photo opportunities. I felt comfortable with their prices; competitive to anywhere else I've gone in Nashville worth mentioning.   I didn't know where to park so I parked on the side in a random parking lot. Looks like there's a lot of up and coming businesses beside them under construction. So I'm assuming once those are complete; parking will be pretty straight forward?   When my Mom & Sister come into town next I'm going to take them here & go to Local Honey for lunch since it's so close.   Can't wait to go back. Welcome to the neighborhood! [REVIEW_14] Village Whiskey's burgers are PHENOMENAL!  Always cooked to perfection (medium rare for me!).  It's like a religious expeirence eating these things.  Went with my boyfriend there on our first date last summer and he's been addicted ever since...as are my sister; all of my friends; and coworkers!  I haven't met one person who doesn't love them.  I'm a former vegetarian who cannot believe I was missing out on these burgers for 4 years.  I am now MORE than making up for that time lost! :) [REVIEW_15] Great staff they will drop everything to help a customer. Good prices. You can always find a pick up game going on in the back. FMN ALWAYS happens and mid week booster drafts if you cant make it on friday. Check out their twitter and face book for updates. They have also donated cards to the Palo Verde High School mtg club on several occasions. They feel more like a community hub; than just a store. They also purchase cards and you might be able to find someone in the back looking to trade. I should also add that While I don't mind playing against kids I really like that I have a place to play with other adults. [REVIEW_16] It was crowded and a small place but they had AMAZING burgers! The food was wonderful! Best burger I had by far! The drinks were good too! [REVIEW_17] Tower Grove South is one of my favorite neighborhoods and Annie Moons Bakery adds to its charm: tasty muffins; good coffee and a relaxing environment. Just go there and see what I mean. Cheers. [REVIEW_18] I absolutely love coming here. Great outdoor place with a wine selection you can't find anywhere else (not your typical wines you find in the grocery). The live music today was fabulous - and on a Thursday afternoon! Come here; get a few cheeses and wine and you will be satisfied. Oh; and the regular menu is crafty and artistic. It's a beautiful place with ambiance and on the palate. [REVIEW_19] This neighborhood place is a hidden gem! I had the Mexican enchilada platter and I was delicious. The neighboring table had the fajitas and the aroma from that sizzling platter was amazing. Since I live close I will definitely be making this a regular spot. [REVIEW_20] Great sushi and reasonably priced! Friendly staff is a plus! They recently expanded their menu which has been a lot of fun too!! The VIP card is great for frequent visitors and if someone in your party isn't up for sushi they can order from the Chinese place next door.",16
50,"[REVIEW_1] why did you burn the building down that was my favorite pizza place. I know you guys wanted to vacation but you don't have to burn it down. whatever now I have to eat pasta Mista [REVIEW_2] Open 24/7 plenty of equipment never too crowded classes also available the staff is always friendly and willing to help the district manager stops in as well every week to Make sure everything is on the up and up and my membership is good everything! [REVIEW_3] It's been a long while since a took a vacation;so i planned a 2 days get away to santa barbara to surprise my wife on the weekend .we drove there with my  09 camry & had a fun day;the next morning which was sunday we went down to start the car;but it didn't ;it was saying key not detected like i know what that is.so i called the toyota dealer after talking to a couple of people i was transfered to the manager who told me that he thinks its the remote control battery is dead but the parts department is closed;i told him i was out of town having a nice weekend with my wife so he told me to come down so i took a cab which cost me $50 by the way;i was so surprised with what happened next.since the parts department was closed the manager took a battery out from another remote put it in mine then called the courtesy shuttle to drive back & didn't charge me a dime.         It's nice to know that humanity & shivery still exist [REVIEW_4] There is no better Thai food in the Tampa Bay area.  This is authentic Thai food. Not your typical ""not too spicy please"" bland Thai food made for Americans. Although you can decide how spicy or not you want your dish. Fresh delicious food at reasonable prices. The Yum Nua beef salad is one of my favorites; tender slices of grilled beef; cucumbers; scallions; purple onion over greens with a light lime dressing. Other favorites include Panang chicken; beef or shrimp; papaya salad; chicken satay; fried rolls; thai sausage. pork larb. If I ever won the lottery I would hire the cook. She's is the best! [REVIEW_5] I just read through all of these reviews and giggled over everyone's unique opinion on what exactly the Goleta K-Mart smells like. My own instincts whisper to me ""cat pee."" And yes! a little sulphur (read that in someone else's review; thanks!) Having lived with cats all my life; it smells like home. This isn't a good thing.  It's almost impressive how bad the check-out is. You can find the shortest line; where there is one or no people in front of you; and it will STILL take you like 20 minutes to get through the line. The last time I went; my nail polish rang up as $82 for some weird fucking reason (probably because their computer system is from like 1983) and then the girl had to do the whole thing over again. The penultimate time I was here; I managed to get in a very short line only to have the lady in front of me decide to sign up for a Sears credit card (REALLY WHO DOES THIS SHIT) at the check-out. Which took an impressively long amount of time. Will I still come here to buy my hair dye? Sadly; yes; because it's like half the price of the grocery store. And lord help me if my natural hair color starts growing in.  Also; I seriously almost run someone over every time I try to park. Not in anger; but just because it seems like the elderly like to hide behind cars and then jump into my view at the last second. It's almost like a conspiracy. hmmm....  well; here's hoping someone finally finds the courage to blow the motherfucker up one day. [REVIEW_6] Both my husband and I have been working with EF for over a year to handle our book keeping. It is truly a pleasure working with everyone over at EF. In the short time; I've been woking with EF; I've learned so much. They are incredibly detail orientated; patient; attentive and  great partners for our growing business. [REVIEW_7] After two years in California I still dream of Yats.  Every time I come into town; this is one of my must-stop restaurants.  If you like cajun / creole served up in big portions for not a lot of money; Yats is where it's at. [REVIEW_8] When in the middle of nowhere with just a few hours before a flight home; I bought too much stuff for my New Years trip to St. Louis and figured I'd check to see if I could get a used suitcase for a good price.  I found a Samsonite suitcase for $6.   SIX DOLLARS.  I know if I went to Ross or TJ Maxx it would have been $130 easy.   So thanks again Goodwill.  You always seem to do me right in the heat of the moment which is why I always donate to you guys before anyone else with my old unused clothing items.  Happy New Year. [REVIEW_9] Fabulous Sunday brunch! Very kid friendly; vanilla lemonade delicious and everything fresh. Friendly service. We will be back! [REVIEW_10] This place is a gem.  My favorite spot in the funk zone to hang out; especially on a Sunday afternoon. Sip on a glass of wine or try a beer sampler- whatever you are in the mood for! They have both; unlike most wine tasting spots around there. If it's a chilly day; warm up by the cozy fireplace and relax by the lounge area... or if it's a warm day you can people watch on the wrap-around porch in the front.  Corks and Crowns is a classy; friendly place for locals and visitors alike.  And they are dog friendly. Did I mention they also have cupcake pairings for your sweet tooth? So decadent and tasty... I think I'll head over there now... [REVIEW_11] A hidden treasure.  Presentation is awesome; very clean; and food is out of this world.  Deserves five stars.  Staff is super friendly and I have left there every time with a smile on my face and a full belly.  Everyone must give this place a try.  I guarantee you will go back time and time again. [REVIEW_12] Tony's is the real deal. My wife picked up a rock in Tucson a few weeks back and it made about a 20"" crack from the edge of the front windshield to the middle on the driver's side. Being a frugal person; I was hoping to get it repaired...but; after doing some Internet research it became obvious this was not going to be possible or cost effective. I read reviews of places around the area and contacted about 4 of them. Tony's had the fastest response and was the most honest in answering my questions. I dealt with Hector and I was impressed. No BS...he answered all my questions in a straight-forward honest manner. I was under the mistaken impression that there was an Antenna in the front windshield which Hector correctly told me there wasn't. After educating myself on issues with Windshields; I asked Hector who was the manufacturer of the glass they used. He told me who they used; why they used them; and why they were top quality. Other companies in town did not respond to this question...seriously; the top rated guy on Yelp; quit answering my emails when I asked him who manufactured the glass he used...REALLY? Now; the kicker is Tony's price was the lowest of all 4 I contacted. And; not just a few dollars...he charged $125 including taxes...I had no idea you could get a front windshield replaced for that. The others were anywhere from $37 to $100+ more. Hector; keep up the good work...I will refer anyone I know to your place for any glass work. [REVIEW_13] Food was fantastic; view perfect; atmosphere is quaint. It was a gorgeous day to sit in the patio we had the corned beef eggs and hash; and the banana foster French toast as well as a burger; it was all delicious! The waitress was super sweet also. [REVIEW_14] Simply the best.  Better than all the rest.  If you're lucky enough to have your car break during the St. Patrick's Day season; you can check out their amazing decorations.  Otherwise; they have several groovy fish tanks and an eclectic clientele to keep you entertained.  And of course; the quality of the work and the pricing are top notch. [REVIEW_15] Absolutely one of the best shops in the country. Incredibly patient and helpful in both rebuilding and choosing a bike. [REVIEW_16] Recently ordered cigars from Holt's and was very happy!  Selection and prices are comparable to other online vendors like JR Cigars.  What I loved about Holt's is they offer various samplers.  Some of the higher end samplers will have humidified delivery!    Ordered the 'King's Ransom' Super Sampler (includes 15 cigars: 3 Ashton VSG Robusto; 3 Padron 1964 Anniversary Exclusivo; 3 Flor de las Antillas Toro; 3 Arturo Fuente Hemingway Signature; and 3 La Aroma de Cuba Mi Amor Reserva Romantico).    Also order the Pepin Garcia 'Field of Dreams' Sampler (includes 18 cigars: 3 Tatuaje Reserva Regios; 3 LADC Mi Amor Reserva Divino; 3 Flor de las Antillas Toro; 3 San Cristobal Clasico; 3 My Father Le Bijou 1922 Torpedo Box Press; 3 Tatuaje Havana VI Verocu #9)  Will definetely be ordering more in the future! [REVIEW_17] I LOVE Katies.   This is a neighborhood locals place with a serious chef and a great menu.  I've been there at least 6 times.    Definitely have the grilled oysters.   The veal with a marsala cream sauce over pasta is one of my faves.  You can create your own pasta ingredients and there have to be 15 or 20 choices.   The po boys are great too.   The same goes for the pizza.  I'm from Chicago and I'm a snob on pizza.  This is the best pizza in NOLA.  The ingredients are super fresh in everything that they make.  It's a great sauce; quality cheese; etc.   They were the only place where I had a pizza that was perfect.   I had sausage; shrimp; and red peppers on my pizzas.   Pizza in the south generally has a doughy crust.  In Chicago; the only pizza you'll get like that is a $5 pizza pizza or pizza hut.    Katie's was the only place where I got a great pizza with a crispy thin crust.   It was the only pizza that stood up to my faves at home.   If it's nice; sit at the 10 or so tables outside.  After a few visits; they welcomed me and my dog as family.   Say hi to Murphy; he took great care of me. [REVIEW_18] This place is awesome! Had to come here on the first day of our honeymoon because I got bronchitis. The doctor told me he would fix this and he did! Everyone here is so nice; I definitely recommend this place. [REVIEW_19] Red Hook is my jam!  This place focuses on their drinks and their extensive food options. I appreciate this a lot. They aren't pretentious; at all; and have a chill funky homey vibe about then. The people there are pretty friendly and welcoming. I had solid drinks from Red Hook. But if you are looking for a coffee shop that can serve good drinks and good food; then Red Hook blows away the competition.  I've been to cafes that serve good drinks; but not good food. This place serves both! [REVIEW_20] Awesome! Great place. The staff are friendly and met all our needs. Very great energy. Each shake is handmade to perfection like a work of art. If you are diabetic this is a no no for you. It was soooo good! The owner even came out and spoke with customers. She has such a beautiful spirit! So happy we stopped by! We couldn't even eat it all. My recommendation is to share.",19
51,"[REVIEW_1] We are choice rewards members and this by far is the worst property that we have ever stayed at and we travel a lot.  I wasted my reward points staying there because their pictures of the property were so deceiving. There was mold all over the bathroom light and ceiling.  Chunks of drywall missing from the walls.  The bathroom smelled like urine.  Their were people smoking;  screaming and running down the halls way after 10 pm and then back at it at 7am. We were told that we were lucky to get the room we got because they were booked up but the parking lot was half empty. Very disappointed and a waste of points. [REVIEW_2] The friendly staff really make this hotel a pleasure to stay in! [REVIEW_3] Food was terrible!!! I ordered through Postmates and my order was WRONG. The food was so bland and such a let down. I will NEVER set foot in this place again. I asked for aioli on the side of my to go wings. NOPE. Swimming in aioli. I asked for the wings crispy. NOPE. Skin fell off immediately so soft. I asked for extra peanuts for my vermicelli;. NOPE! Got ZERO peanuts. Asked for sauce. Wish I hadn't. The sauce for he vermicelli was TERRIBLE. Omg never never never ever again. Funny thing is; when I got my receipt; all of the modifications were there. I was expecting to pay extra but I didn't Bc they didn't do any of them. [REVIEW_4] Great place for lunch or dinner. Service is a little slow but didn't matter.  Food was great. [REVIEW_5] Horrible customer service.  Customers should be allowed to try on another size.  The sales associate actually refused to get me another size; which is not what I have experienced at other stores.  I wasn't asking for anything out of the ordinary; I only took in 2 bras and wanted ONE of them in a different size.  The store wasn't busy so I don't understand her reluctance. You can give me advice on how it should fit; but don't make me stand there peeking out of the fitting room doorway; half dressed; trying to justify why I just want to *try* the next size up.  I know how I want my lingerie to fit and will go elsewhere where I won't be put in such a humiliating situation. [REVIEW_6] I love Mint! I've only ever had good meals here. Fairly priced; delicious food; good vegetarian options. [REVIEW_7] expensive; bad food and service. I have been to other corner bakery cafes; and I usually like them; but I tend to get terrible service at this one. These problems manifests as long waits for meals even during slow times; and getting orders wrong. The last time (never again) I went in it was a slow morning; and it took them 45 minutes to get me my eggs; and when they came they were cold. I informed the cashier that my eggs were cold and I asked him if they could make me new eggs.  He said yes; and took my eggs.  He came back out with my same plate; and it was evident that he microwaved the plate with the toast and fruit on it; the toast was soggy; and fruit warm. I returned my food; and have vowed to never return. [REVIEW_8] If you want a hole in the wall pizza place this is where you should go. I don't know why more people don't know about this place. The pizza is amazing! Maybe even best pizza in STL. I love it. I wouldn't classify it as Chicago style though because it doesn't have chunky tomato sauce. [REVIEW_9] Was not impressed with the store. The employee could care less I walked in and needed some questions answered and it was like I was bothering him that I was there. There are other stores so I will try to utilize the Brandon or valrico one although this one is so close to where I live. It's a shame. [REVIEW_10] From the very beginning the hostess was also working as the cashier so we weren't even welcomed when we came in. We had to ask the hostess for a table and we're made to wait for no good reason. The server was pretty much non existent and was very unfriendly she didn't even introduce herself or stop by the table (let alone ask us how our food was). I order the biscuits and gravy and a side of eggs. My food was cold when it came out and wasn't even that good. And on top of it all the food is way overpriced ($30 for French toast; biscuits and gravy; and 2 sides? NO THANKS). Don't even bother wasting your time or money here. Overall terrible; definitely never coming back. [REVIEW_11] Great place to come relax and drink some great coffee. The donuts are soooo good. I greatly appreciate their service. They are always very friendly. [REVIEW_12] I would give this place zero stars if I could. The bouncer told me I couldn't leave until I gave him a ""little somethin somethin"" and took away my friend's legal ID. When we asked for it back; he said he wouldn't give it back until the cops came. What a fucking joke. Save your self esteems and your personal property and go somewhere else. [REVIEW_13] Best tacos in SB!  Front counter guy always pleasant and friendly too. Love this place. [REVIEW_14] Can't say enough good things about this place!! The vibe is awesome and the food is even better!! GO NOW! DONT WAIT!! [REVIEW_15] Found Akoi based on high reviews online. I went with a friend and her daughter; we all had a good time. The ladies who serviced us were polite and friendly; and they did an excellent job. The atmosphere of the nail salon was sophisticated and trendy compared to most salons I've seen. [REVIEW_16] WAWA is the go-to-guy of convenience stores. Whether you're looking for a quick meal; or a late-night snack(presumably while intoxicated); the store contains everything imaginable. Had it not been for their lack of lottery tickets; SLURPEE products and booze; I would consider WAWA to eliminate all other convenience stores; and monopolize the entire industry. Try the stuffed jalapeño pretzel. [REVIEW_17] Finally! Great pizza & knots at the beach!!! Excellent location with a cool street presence. These guys know what they're doing. [REVIEW_18] Seriously one of the go to restaurants for a date night with my husband. I have eaten here too many times to remember. The food is delicious! The meat eater as well as vegetarian will be equally pleased. The key to dining at Khmer is timing.  I am from this neighborhood so I know the pain of finding parking around here. Buffer in time to find a parking spot and get to Khmer early for a great experience. [REVIEW_19] Alright; so this place is getting a bit of a bad rap and I'm not sure why.   I lived in LA for four years and so far this is the closest I can get to legit street tacos.  If you want a great lunch; get the stuffed avocafo for an app and street tacos for lunch. Cannot go wrong.   The service was absolutely fantastic and it's so cheap that I'm not sure what you can really complain about.   So glad this place exists downtown ! [REVIEW_20] Recently had my car tinted by Orange Tint and Tune and had fantastic service.  They offer a car pick up service if you live within 4 miles of their shop which is extremely convenient.  Carlos was my technician and went over all the tint options with me and even adjusted the grade of the tint after I expressed the look that I was trying to achieve.  That's the kind of customer care that deserves 5 stars.  In addition; the receptionist was very pleasant and the owner Dustin even followed up to see how my service was.",13
52,"[REVIEW_1] We had the salmon; burger; and beer-brined chicken. Every item was excellent and cooked to perfection; a great improvement since I was here last; years ago. The herbed butter and sauces are amazing. They also have mastered pickled vegetables as well; something that enhances dishes that feature them; even in an ancillary role.   Once again; I'm tempted by the poutine. But it's 107 degrees today; and although the AC is great; it seems off to order it. One day.  By the way; if it's hot; have the drink called ""The Cooler"". It is worth it.  Our tall server gentleman with the green eyes was great. [REVIEW_2] Have eaten here twice now on two separate trips to Nashville and each meal has been fantastic. The first trip I got the sweet potato pancakes which are so fluffy it is like they are made with clouds Delicious. The second go round I got some eggs and sausage which of course comes with a side of pancakes. Not only are the pancakes great but everything else was cooked perfectly and served with whipped butter that was probably made in heaven. My son got the wild blueberry pancakes which were equally fantastic. Get there before 8 AM and you shouldn't have to wait in the lines out the door. Make sure you get a free parking pass to put on the dash of your car as well. Great experience and worth getting up early for. Probably worth the wait too but I'm not into waiting in the snow like most folks on our first trip there! [REVIEW_3] Outstanding! They have great gluten-free and vegan options too. The salad; pizza; and root beer were just perfect. [REVIEW_4] This place has a great clean modern feel. Kim is the lady in charge and wants you to be nothing but very happy when you are leaving. I usually go to her but she recommended I try someone new. I did and Lane did a wonderful job. Great pedicure; new massage chairs; perfect gel manicures (not thick or thin in areas). Mcalisters is right next door so fun to grab a tea and get your nails done. [REVIEW_5] Went here for the first time yesterday. Staff was pleasant and food was really good. My husband especially liked the Vietnamese coffee! Too strong for me; but he loved it. [REVIEW_6] We were looking forward to trying out this newly redone restaurant. The atmosphere is fresh and well done . We were there for breakfast. They now have table service. Things were great until the food came out. My pancakes tasted like stale bread.  My wife's eggs were cold. The potatoes were not cooked. They brought the wrong side dishes. For silverware; we were given  forks but no knives. It took a while to find a waiter to get the silverware we needed. We did speak to the manager. She offered a discount of $2.50  not that we were looking one; but why bother?). However; she did not remove the extra charge for the incorrect side dish we didn't order ($4.00).  She did apologize for the food verbally but somehow we were made to feel like she couldn't care less. I don't write many reviews unless I really love something or dislike something. This restaurant fits into the latter category. Sorry. A nice decor is not enough. [REVIEW_7] Very friendly clean a must for all your nail needs.  Open 6 days comfortable chairs warm towels. Don't pass this Salon up man are welcome too [REVIEW_8] Best; freshest Mexican in Franklin. Good Margaritas too. Owners and wait staff are friendly. Great family run business. [REVIEW_9] I've been here a few times now (once just recently during devour) and have thoroughly enjoyed my experience. The guac is fantastic; reminds me a bit of festiva's though less heat. Get the tamal corn cakes - love the hint of sweet you get in addition to the savory meat. I also absolutely love their green rice. They have good drink options though I've only had the sangria and the house marg. And finally; the price point is appropriate. I will keep coming back here - I hear brunch is excellent! [REVIEW_10] I have been in the industry a long time and this is one of the best places I have ever been to.  The menu is great (and super reasonably priced); the wine list is phenomenal; and the service was superb.  Moreover; the atmosphere was beautiful. I would recommend this place to anyone. Specifically on Wednesdays; they have half off all bottles of wine including their reserve list! Insane deal! Happy dining! [REVIEW_11] The staff is very good at providing misinformation with; what I can only guess is; the objective of stretching out simple things into multiple; billable appointments. Be sure to show up on time so you can have the honor of waiting for netley d'souza to stroll by; in an unapologetic fashion; 45 minutes after your scheduled appointment. A word of caution; though. Do not suggest that his staff treat you with decency or that anyone other than yourself be punctual. Doctor d'souza will respond by having a staff member call you to tell you to find another doctor. If you're looking for integrity; punctuality; consideration for your time; a competent staff; a doctor who is on top of his game; or anyone to do anything other than give you a hard time or do more than the bare minimum; well; I guess you had better keep looking. [REVIEW_12] I can't recall the day I went but it was a memorial resturant experience.  I was greeted by an incredibly nice cashier. After a hard decision I ordered a Devils delight and the girl giggled ( of course I was confused) She explained it was Dev's Delight and named after her because it was her idea for a burger and me calling it Devils delight was a bit funny because her friends call her Devil Dev ( hard to believe such a nice girl could aquire such a nickname but cute). After she took my thorough of a medium burger; and truffle fires i didn't have to wait very long. Even before I ate the burger the smell it self had my mouth watering.  The burger was cooked to perfection and what was on the burger was amazing!  This burger was a standard beef foundation with mozzarella cheese tomato basil and a portobello mushroom; what great idea for a burger! For a mushroom lover this with a side of the delicious truffle fries is perfect. Excellent quality and service;  a bit expensive but worth every penny. No question about it I will be a return customer! [REVIEW_13] Sally is great! She really takes her time and I can tell she genuinely cares to give a quality cut. Been to countless barbershops that charge a ridiculous amount for a ""supercuts"" haircut but at players you'll walk out with a quality cut for a reasonable price. [REVIEW_14] I've been a customer here for a very long time now; and i love it. The sushi is very fresh. I went here after a while of not visiting; and it seemed as though they must have gotten new people to work. Sorry for the lengthy post; but i think this should clear some things up.   For one; they definitely got a new sushi chef. He's so much more friendly with the customers; and is fast! They also had a new server. Who was very sweet. Whenever she made a mistake she smiled and kindly explained that it was her first time serving. I think her name was Melissa or Michelle. I went back after a while and it seemed that she got the hang of everything.  I also read a comment down there where it said that there was an empty parking lot on friday night at 6pm. Well every time i go; its usually very busy around 7pm. Also; they switched locations. They used to be on West End and they moved to Brentwood. Not many people knew of the big switcharoo so that could be the misunderstanding.  I came here a few weeks ago; and ordered a soup and salad like i always do. Their miso soup is just pretty basic but there salad dressing is SO DELICIOUS. I dont know what they put in there but its creamy and amazing. I love their deep fried rolls (crazy is my favorite) but their special roll called the Spider roll is magnificent also.  This place is really amazing. And i suggest you give it a go. You'll be hooked. [REVIEW_15] came here for good reviews. sorry but was not happy with my cut. not faded.i always say if they don't do a good fade; haircut is a shame. 2 minute massage. didn't last long enough.  never coming back [REVIEW_16] Truly one of the places where your eyes are bigger than your stomach. And even so you wish your stomach could double its capacity.   The donuts here are imaginative and original. I had to come here as soon as it opened to grab some coffee and sample their daily selection of donuts before my seminar started in the morning.   New Orleans is known for the buttermilk drop and while I didn't get a chance to try the one at Wink's in the French Quarter; I imagine the ones at District are a good representation. It's a cakey donut hole with sweet icing draped over it. Generally; I'm more a yeast donut fan but those buttermilk drops were delightful. I could have eaten a half dozen; no sweat. But there were other items to try.   District has ""croquenuts"" available which is their version of a griddled donut sandwich. I chose the ""Monte Cristo"" for it's sweet and savory combination. Gooey cheese and salty ham between a donut covered in powdered sugar with a hefty dollop of raspbery preserves nestled in the center of the donut. This was a magical creation. Get it if you have the chance.  Finally; to top of my donut extravaganza; I chose the Miso Olive Oil Praline Bacon donut. It's a mouthful to say but wasn't to consume. Such a fascination combination of flavors from this donut. I chose it mostly for the bacon but the miso; olive oil; and praline each hit their notes with every bite. Simply wonderful.   Not to forget was the the Vietnamese Iced Coffee to wash it all down. It was the jolt I needed to wake me up for this early morning call for donuts.   You bet I'll make another (or several) stops next time I'm in New Orleans. [REVIEW_17] Only tried the hip city ranch chicken sandwich and fries but WOW were they delicious. Sandwich was on point (could've been a tiny bit crispier in my opinion) but the taste and portion was excellent. Will definitely be visiting again. Only downside is that the space is tiny and you most likely will not find a seat if you go on the weekend between 12 & 5 pm. [REVIEW_18] We tried this place while we were in town and really liked all the food. We ordered the burger and wings. You can't go wrong eating here! The staff was very nice and helpful with the menu! [REVIEW_19] So glad to have this addition to our local restaurant scene. They always have fresh fish; never frozen. Nice and courteous staff; and a clean place. Keep it up Joe. [REVIEW_20] Did not like this hotel at all. Me and my husband stayed there one night after getting off our honeymoon cruise out of New Orleans. While still on the boat I called the hotel to let them know that we would only be staying one of the two nights we reserved due to some issues with our home in Houston. We had to leave early to address them in person. I communicated that with the manager who stated that he would call me back because he was dealing with another customer. Never received a callback. We checked in Saturday March 5 at 1600. We left the next day Sunday March 6 at 1130. As we checked out I told the manager it was an early checkout and he said that I would have to talk to the third party vendor (booking.com) to not be charged. I was okay with that.  Fast forward to today. Called booking.com and the customer associate stated that the manager charged me for the second night that I never used as a penalty for not warning them of our ealy check out. He lied. I spoke to him at least twice about us leaving. DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU ARE OUT OF TOWN. VERY UNCLEAN AND DISGUSTING and the management is sketchy. Take your money and go somewhere nicer.",16
53,"[REVIEW_1] I believe the gentlemen at the front desk name was Kris? He was great; the rain was coming down so hard and he went above and beyond and walked me as well as Leo with an umbrella to the car!  I have taken Leonidas there for about two years now; unfortunately he is a nervous Nelly; but we started seeing Dr. Deutsch and he has been the best with Leo! He is thorough and takes his time to ensure Leo is comfy. [REVIEW_2] This is a really interesting restaurant. It's not our typical kind of place but we are so glad we went. They have burgers/sandwiches and sushi. I got a couple of sushi rolls that were divine. My husband got the hot fish sandwich and fries which he also enjoyed. They also have spiked shakes! So much yum. Plus the service was great. We will be back. [REVIEW_3] Best Steakhouse on the beach and one of only 2 worth eating in all of Pinellas. Great food & great staff.   The ribeye is perfect.  If you like charred;  ask for Pittsburgh.  They know how to do it right.  Truffle fries;  bacon scallops and the chophouse potatoes must go with your meal.   We're weekly regulars.  Highly recommend. [REVIEW_4] This is the most poorly designed mall I have ever seen.  You have to cut across parking lots to get from place to place...in either the hot blazing sun or the freezing wind.  Reno officials were completely ripped off by the designers of this ""strip"" mall. For a beautiful example of a great outdoor mall check out The Grove in So Cal.  All parking is on the outside with the stores clustered on the inside. Would not have cost any more for this more efficient design. This mall is ridiculous. [REVIEW_5] Food is good.  Decor is nice.   Service was terrible.  Our drink orders were not what we ordered.  Rather than tell us they don't carry certain items;  they made up their own drinks.  It was terribly disappointing. [REVIEW_6] Always get the egg rolls and wonton soup on my way home from work. The generals chicken and fried rice are my favorite entrees. [REVIEW_7] Service today was soooooo slow. 1.5 hours today to get simple lunch. Food was also awful which was really the worst. Oyster Po boy was disgusting and couldn't eat half of it. My colleague couldn't finish his chicken blt either because it was so bad. One of worst meals I've had in a long time. Zero stars are more appropriate. Do no go here. [REVIEW_8] Disappointing experience beginning with confusion with order and computer software. Had to place my order 3x; chicken wrap was okay but not spectacular; served with fries that were frozen  in the middle and soggy. Not what I expected for 10.00. [REVIEW_9] I ran over a nail near some of the new construction near Allisonville Road and got a tow to this Firestone location. I had gone to another firestone location in the past; and was pleasantly surprised that they were able to pull up all of my history as I wasn't sure when the last time I got tires and also if I had purchased any warranties on it. The woman at the front desk was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. I assumed that they would make me get all 4 tires changed (as that is typically what happens when one tire goes out at least for me) but the woman walked me through why I only need to change two of my four tires. I was very grateful because that would have added another $400 if I got all four tires changed. Bottom line; I felt very confident that the employees here were looking out for my best interests; and not for their wallets! [REVIEW_10] If I could post -1 stars I would! I mistakenly brought my 13 year old son and his friend here and didn't look around enough before paying .. I kid you not the bumper car area is as big as a 1 car garage.. They basically only had room to spin in circles. :-( the blow up slide reminds me of the smaller version of what you can rent for your back yard. They only have 10 arcade games.. Everyone including the parent has to pay to play.. The food is not even up to par with Chuck E Cheese. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand the staff is rude. My best advice is keep your coins in your pocket. [REVIEW_11] Worst restaurant experience ever. First; this place is super cramped! The noise level was atrocious. I don't know why they haven't done anything about this. We could not engage in an enjoyable conversation.  Second; my plate had dried up food on it from the previous guest. I understand that can happen. But nevertheless; yuck! The service was mediocre. Third; the food was loaded with salt. My husband has high blood pressure so this was a major concern to me. I took a few bites but didn't finish and definitely didn't bother to take home. You cannot enjoy the flavor of the food because everything was drowning in salt. Gross. Fourth; our bill was extremely high. This food was definitely over priced for the quality.  The dessert was decent. But the thing that put the final nail in their restaurant coffin; was the Roach that grazed over my high heel on my way out. I wanted to die. Never again!!!!! Don't waste your time or your money and they seriously need to hire an exterminator now!!!!!! [REVIEW_12] Last night I paid cover and bought two overpriced drinks and then went out dancing. It was so hot and stuffy that I got really thirsty. They refused to give me water! They said I had to buy a bottle for $2. I tried to reason with them; but they were pretty rude. I have never heard of a bar not giving someone water when requested. Bartender said that 7-11 did not have to give me water either ????? So weird; and such a bad policy considering how much I had already spent there and how hot it was. I will never go back. I refuse to spend another dollar there on principle. I ended up leaving; getting a cup of water from my car and walking back in with it.  After that I was mad at them; but trying to have fun for my friends' sake. Still I told the Rue 13 photographer that I did not want to be in their promotional photos; but they took pictures of me anyway.  Finally; my tights ripped because they snagged on splinters when I walked by their stage area.  Cheap quality; overpriced; bad service. Do not recommend! [REVIEW_13] I was thrilled when my favorite eyebrow threading place opened this location in Wesley Chapel. I see Ina every 2 or 3 weeks; and I am very pleased with her work. She is not as speedy as some of the others; but that is because she takes time to make sure she has done a thorough job. [REVIEW_14] I have used Steve twice now to do jobs at my house. Today I had him come by and replace some of the ""criss-cross"" redwood trellis that was used as a ""skirt"" around my deck. My puppy had chewed on it. Steve showed up with the right materials and tools and was done before no time. He is very handy; courteous; and does excellent work. I plan on using him again for my next ""fix-it"" job that I don't have the time; skills; or tools to do. [REVIEW_15] We were in St Pete on the weekend and decide to eat sushi. The worst sushi ever! Never go there again. All 3 or 4 king of sushi we ordered was terrible. [REVIEW_16] This is a horrible and unethical company that only has interest in profiting. They refused to fill an override prescription with my retail pharmacy because they sent a letter in advance. The prescription was needed TODAY since it was out.(they take 8 days to deliver meds) I was unaware to begin with that it was now going through them and not my regular pharmacy. They LIED about a few things pertaining to why and how it got to them as well. They tried to pass the buck onto BCBS in getting a one time approval for me to get my MUCH required meds today since I was out. Fortunately; BCBS was still on the other line when this happened. They kept saying they sent a letter; which we never received. That's why they refused to fill the prescription by the way.....because they sent a letter!   So; if you are sick or dying or both and need your meds in order to live; they DON'T CARE. They not only provided the worst service EVER; and LIED; they also HUNG THE PHONE UP on us and the BCBS rep.  A consumer complaint was filed with the BBB as well as through the California Dept. of Health. They have NUMEROUS complaints on here and the BBB!   We also notified our employer as well.    We have been on the phone trying to deal with this for ALMOST FOUR HOURS NOW.   If you're a company that has a choice to use this service; STAY AWAY.   If you're an individual that has the option to opt. out. OPT. OUT!   If your health; and life are worth anything to you or the people around you; STAY AWAY! [REVIEW_17] Went in with a friend for a bite to eat before doing some bar hopping. For some reason the menu to me seemed somewhat limited but I might be alone on that. It's not pricey but for the type of food they serve I feel like it's slightly over priced and in my opinion that food wasn't out of this world. It was average at best. We tipped our waitress 15% and she was slightly rude to us on the way out. Overall not a fan...there's much better places out there to spend your money. [REVIEW_18] They served me a frozen pizza and skunked beer.  'Nuff said. [REVIEW_19] I've had some great Ethiopian food but this place was the worst ever; very disappointing and overpriced!  The service was very slow and the waitress spent most of the time chatting with her fellow employees and essentially ignoring us.    The menu was misleading - it lists a combo of ""all vegetables"" for $15; but really you just get 8 items of their choosing - the ""Queen's Eight"" platter.  Our waitress didn't even know this; until I questioned after she only brought us 6 items; and she had to ask someone else.  It seems unfair to charge the exact same price for a vegetarian platter as for one with meat dishes.    Every other place I've visited served the combo platter on a big piece of injera spread out on a large plate but here they serve a few (very small) portions of items on a couple of strips of injera.  Their injera was a disgrace!  As some other reviewers have noted; it was slightly dried out and the edges were crusty!  To top it off; the veggie items were maybe lukewarm; at best; and pretty bland for Ethiopian cuisine.    As we finished up our meal; I chose to eat a salvageable portion of the injera that had all the juices soaked into it.  Unfortunately hiding underneath it was a long black hair!  Needless to say; we won't be back!!! [REVIEW_20] Pros:  - Convenient for when you're looking to feed an overworked sleep-deprived film crew at 6AM on a Sunday on a tight budget  Cons: - Food is so bad that even overworked sleep-deprived film crew would rather starve  - Eggs tasted like paper; toast tasted like cardboard; potatoes felt like decomposing fruits (not that I would know)  I cannot understand how they can mess up the most basic sides.. but hey; I guess they're not exactly known for their eggs; toast; and potatoes  Paying a bit more for Dunkin' Donuts sandwiches/croissants is much more worth it.",7
54,"[REVIEW_1] I've been to Nordstrom before but this was my first time at this store inside the mall. Very clean inside; lots of varieties to choose from. The men's jeans are very costly so you should take advantage of whatever sales that they have. They got some good cologne for men and women. [REVIEW_2] The price was as advertised. The service was top notch and the room was better than expected. Located right next to Bourbon Street and the Absinthe house. I will definitely stay here again. [REVIEW_3] Being from Cincinnati we know ipas and urban south has the best ones we've found in Nola. Brewery is casual and low key. [REVIEW_4] Meet by a great hostess at the door; Jenna. Her smile was amazing! Drinks at the bar were rather good.  They actually have a loco moco! BOOM! [REVIEW_5] My favorite Italian restaurant in Tucson. Family owned since the 1930's or 40's. Excellent lasagna and chicken parmesean. Why people flock to the Olive Garden over this place is beyond me.... [REVIEW_6] Great flavored food and good service! The spring rolls were awesome! I had seen reviews stating the food was greasy; but ours was all cooked perfectly and fresh tasting! [REVIEW_7] Highly recommend this tour. We had a great experience and didn't have to spend a boat load of money to have a good time. The tour guides were informational and we really enjoyed the beer samples along the way (probably a little too much). If you're just arriving in St. Louis and are looking for fun and inexpensive experiences; this is the place to go. [REVIEW_8] Since I work in University City; I decided today after work to treat myself to a manicure; since I hadn't gotten one in at least 2 years.  Mind you; since I play guitar and do makeup/paint faces; I have to keep my nails short; but every once in a while; or in this case; once every few years; I like to indulge in that simple pleasure that is a manicure.  Since I am contemplating getting my cosmetology license in the next few years and had never taken advantage of a student clinic before; I decided to give it a shot with a manicure on the first visit rather than a haircut or color so I wouldn't take any risk leaving with a hairstyle I was not expecting to walk out with; had that been the case.  Milan was the student who did my nails; and even though she seemed a bit shy at first; she was very friendly; made conversation with me; and more importantly; she probably did a better job than many professional licensed manicurists have done on my nails.  Even though it is a cosmetology school; it has the vibe of a real salon with cool decor and friendly reception staff to boot; and since it is an Aveda school; it smells great too!  First time clients also get some free samples as well as a comment card which doubles as a 10% off coupon for your next visit!  I will definitely keep the Aveda Institute in mind for future services! [REVIEW_9] Me and my family went yesterday. We ordered 12 donuts. All different. We didn't know that you couldn't order with two toppings bc they only can ""hold one topping"" ... the donuts where made fresh and topped to order. They were amazing. They did take a little longer because they are fresh but we made it just before a rush. They were warm and GREAT! Would highly recommend... a little bit more expensive than dunkin but worth it. I'm not normally a cake donut (no yeast here) fan but these are a treat! [REVIEW_10] Authentic Margherita wood - fired pizza...tender leathery crust...crushed Italian tomatoes...and this lactose intolerant customer appreciates that they weren't too snooty to put dairy - free cheese on their masterpiece pie! [REVIEW_11] One of my all time favorite breakfast spots anywhere! The vegetarian sausage and egg biscuits are so freakin good and like lots else on them menu- nap inducing. Great homemade food and desserts. Diner style with fast service and a long wait that's worth it. Get there as soon as they open for shorter wait. Lunch options are also good. [REVIEW_12] I am obsessed with this place! They have great and quick service. Great place for a affordable; good quality and quick bite (carryout service available ). I always get the fish of the day and it never disappoints.  Today the perch was great but my favorite is Mahi mahi. Love this new addition to Callowhill businesses! [REVIEW_13] So so in love with this place & it is gorgeous. A very spacious & modern design & most of all CLEAN!!!! Love Will; Amanda & Sal! I have made several purchases to include some mods and atty's and being a newbie I have issues from time to time with the devices. Not because the devices aren't working but I may take something apart and can't figure out how to put it back together (newbie ish) lol They always help me and get me back to vaping!!! They have a wide variety of juices; mods; atty's and i'm always in there tasting something. You've got to try it! You will not be sorry! In love with this spot! [REVIEW_14] So I was traveling in Santa Barbara on business when I looked in the mirror and realized that my eyebrows were *a mess.*  So; after a quick search on Yelp; I was led to Salon 19.  Yelpers did not disappointment!  The folks at Salon 19 were able to get me in quick; did an amazing job; it didn't cost an arm and a leg (a regular wax is $20) and now I can spend the rest of my business trip looking fly.  Thank you Salon 19! [REVIEW_15] Once again as of Friday it seems as though Wholefoods is moving away from organic and non gmo labeled products!  This transition is moving Sooo slow! Wholefoods market share will no doubt decline!  Also they always out of stock of store brand organic chicken breast [REVIEW_16] Thanks to Erin M I am addicted to their burritos! At $5 it's hard to find a better deal around (ahem Chipotle; ahem) and their burritos are flavorful and filling. I can make one last for 2 meals if I'm not starving. I usually order the tofu verde since I enjoy the level of spice in the sauce. [REVIEW_17] Cindy is the best! Great food and service. Food is authentic and so is the staff. Everything is made fresh and you can taste the difference from other Mexican restaurants at first bite. I would recommend to anyone that enjoys Mexican cuisine. [REVIEW_18] My favorite sushi restaurant in West County. Amazing sushi; beautiful dining space. Great for dates or family you want to impress. [REVIEW_19] Very nice lady working here.  Very helpful to two out-of-towners looking for special mementos. [REVIEW_20] Restaurants don't have to have $50 entrees to be great.  This hole in the wall is ran by a nice family and offers 7 different types of BBQ Sauces made in house!  The Maque Choux Mac is one of the best things I've ever had.  For under $15 you can enjoy that with their many times of sandwiches and/or meat selections.",19
55,"[REVIEW_1] Salad was full of brown wilted iceberg lettuce. The pizza was cold by the time I arrived home (picked it up.) Way too expensive for this awful product. [REVIEW_2] Pleasant little laundromat right next to the Peppermill. 25 cent pinball and video games to while away the time. Many post-BurningMan cleanings while I was there. [REVIEW_3] I have been to The Blind Tiger on multiple occasions for everything from business meetings to pleasure like this morning. It has a great atmosphere inside and is in a convenient location. And after this mornings experience; along with multiple subpar visits; I had to write a review. The staff's attitude is always hit or miss on whether or not they are having a good day. I walked in this morning about 30 minutes after opening. It was quiet inside because it is an early Sunday morning. I said good morning to the girl who looked like she was mad at the world. Okay; we all have bad days and this wasn't the first time experiencing this there so I blew it off. I stated that I wanted my order to go and order two drinks. I asked about a pastry which was told it was a guava and cheese (one of my favorites) so I ordered one of those too. I sitting outside and walked back in after a few minutes to check on my order. I saw that the pastry was boxed up (which I appreciate the personal touch of their logo on the box) and then was told my first drink was ready. It wasn't in a to go cup so it had to be fixed. Instead of the barista handing it to me at the counter where I grabbed the pastry and was waiting; maybe three feet from the barista; she made me walk down to her to grab the cup instead of her walking to me. I walked back outside to wait on my second order; came back in a few minutes later to my next drink just being finished. I told the barista that the drink looked beautiful from the design she made on top and got zero response. And no have a good day; thank you; nothing. Instead the ladies were talking about what food they wanted to eat. Again; I was the only one who they were waiting on because it was a Sunday morning. I left and began drinking my coffee and it wasn't hot and my boyfriend's wasn't either; but it wasn't worth going back after all of that. And to top it all off; when I got home to eat the pastry; it didn't have any cheese in it and barely any guava and I threw part of it away. What blows my mind even more is that they hold training classes for those who want to learn more about coffee. They should focus more on making sure their staff is performing up to expectations as today they failed in almost every way possible. [REVIEW_4] VEGGIE CHILI. Never in my life have I ever craved vegetarian chili until I found this place. It's absolutely amazing. There really isn't anything on menu that's bad. They make everything to order so if you're a picky eater and one of the wraps has a few things you don't like they'll take them out for you. The staff here is also great. I've been going here for lunch fairly consistently for the past two years and it's been the same staff since my fist visit. Overall great lunch spot! [REVIEW_5] I am not sure they deserve one star..but they do not deserve two. Went this afternoon shortly after lunchtime. Walked in and was seated with my girl near the buffet. We discussed eating from it...but decided against it. I haven't been to a CM since the one left the Foothills mall many years ago....I never had any issue with anything at that location. The one on Campbell was not good. Server was polite; but when she came and gave us silverware...it was as if she was playing tiddlywinks...I was a bit perplexed when my three pieces were laid down knife....spoon over knife at a 45 degree angle; then the fork over top the same way...about 6 inches from my napkin. I hadn't thought about it until now...but I feel she was trying in code to tell me not to eat there. Yeah....that has to be it. I looked at the fork...and it looked as if it was taken from the table behind us....as they were using it....it was replaced with a clean one....I am hoping it was anyways...at least there was nothing on it that I could see...and that is 90% of the battle. On to the food. I ordered a chorizo burro. $9.00. This was the driest chorizo I have ever eaten....as my girth with attest.....I have had much chorizo in my life. About three hours after.....I feel yucky. Anyways.....I will not be returning here. [REVIEW_6] Excellent selection!  Gilley's has both an antique section (and barn!) and a newer craft section. I can only speak for the antique section. There are loads of booths with something for everyone. Be sure to check it out if you like antiquing. [REVIEW_7] We went here; on advice from a newspaper review.  What a disappointment!  The bread was like Wonder Bread; with a dipping ""marinara"" that was red just like sauce straight from a can; no simmering! The food all lacked flavor; and that is being very kind & considerate! [REVIEW_8] I will literally never eat here because the owner/parking lot bouncer was very rude when we went to dinner on Saint Patrick's day ar Tir a Nog.. We tried to park in open parking that was sectioned off by SHORT HILLS RESTAURANT AND DELI OF CHERRY HILL NJ;  orange cones and signs (which by the way are completely illegal) and they were not respectful nice or friendly about us accidentally parking there.. They were simply jealous of the prosperous Irish pub... The man/parking lot bouncer (not sure of his name) was completely rude... Even though they closed at 9 he would not let us park there as of 8:15... We are new residents to this area and looking for new local places to enjoy BUT we will NOT EVER be enjoying this place (SHORT HILLS RESTAURANT AND DELI) since the owner(or parking lot bouncer was so rude) we will NEVER fraternize a business who stands for being rude to their neighbors and especially to their fellow business owners who pay for the parking spots just as much as they do.... Short Hills Restaurant and Deli  I'm extremely disappointed in you're neighborhood hospitality and how you treat you're neighbors!! [REVIEW_9] This is the best Thai food I've found in the Nashville area. This is a very authentic Thai restaurant and I would highly recommend it. [REVIEW_10] This used to be my go-to spot for mani and pedis; mostly because it was very close to my home. I moved to port Richmond about 6 years ago and about a year ago this place was taken Over by ""new management"" and completely changed and at all for the better.   When they first switched over the new owner would offer you champagne or wine and made promises of what else was to come. For example They offered your own tools to you if you were a frequent client ; and punch cards for rewards. However ; I watched the quality of this place go right down the drain. The service became slow and less accommodating. There's no way I could get out of there in under an hour mostly due to the inexpirienced techs who I felt were winging it. I started getting the worst work and have since moved on. Stay out of there locals ; there's way better shops out there! [REVIEW_11] Omgoodness!!! This place is a gem!!! Delish! We had the duck tacos; jalapeño hush puppies; collard greens (done right) and the smoked chicken wings!!! Everything was amazing!! The duck tacos were simple with fresh mixed greens; the smoked chicken wings really were succulent with the best tangy sweet sauce ever; and they were served with a real house made ranch dressing; The collar greens; don't even get me started they were delicious cooked with a reduced Maple syrup and bacon yumminess! The hush puppies were house made as well served with a honey butter that was to die for.   We sat at the bar; because the place was jamming! Wonderful food and great service! [REVIEW_12] I was very disappointed with my recent stay here. I've been quite happy with SPG/Aloft hotels normally but this Aloft was just awful. The entire facility was poorly kept and generally dirty. The occupants of the neighboring room were up until the early morning (3am) smoking & drinking inside/outside their room. The staff conveyed overall apathy and did little to nothing as a result. Save yourself a headache and look for a better option if staying around here. [REVIEW_13] The manager of this McDonalds needs to teach the help the Big Mac jingle....It starts with Two all beef patties.....TWO....TWO...not one freakin patty you idiots! How can you forget to make a big mac and forget one of the burgers? It's not rocket science! Also the slowest and dimmest counter help to take orders. They take one order at a time and then b.s. with the help next to them while the lines get longer.   So the advice is to make sure you ask for EVERYTHING you want them to put on a bun for you or it will be missing. [REVIEW_14] Loved; Loved; Loved Annlyn!  My wife and I recently were looking for a place and Annlyn was GREAT. She made us feel at home before we ever saw an apartment. The building is loaded with amenities ( a massage room; fitness room; rooftop; way more than I can even describe- truly fabulous)  I highly recommend Fusion1560 and I  recommend you deal with Annlyn. [REVIEW_15] Sad!  Last time eating here.  Over priced; over cooked; under staffed!  Salad ok butt charged $2 for extra anchovies (4 total).  No background music in seating area so we could hear everything the cooks and staff did all weekend but they never ask if we needed anything.  The management has now called me a ""sad little man"" in her response.  I'm not sad just disappointed in a chain restaurant that use to be good.  You should be the one apologizing for the bad food.  And yes that young man was nice butt by then my lunch was already ruined by that horrible excuse of a roast pork sandwich. [REVIEW_16] So yummy! Best hotdogs in Santa Barbara hands down! Guy is super friendly and helpful. I love how they change it up every week with a different special. Definitely recommend this place you gotta try it. [REVIEW_17] My sister had been wanting to do archery for a while so I grabbed a random Groupon to try this out. Turned out to be a ton of fun and it wasn't super busy on a Tuesday evening so we both got to simultaneously shoot. The owner (I am assuming) has an absolutely insane sense of humor. It seemed the people who were already there are regulars and extremely helpful in keeping me from breaking the rules and killing myself. Truly a fun place to be and a great experience. Not a bad way to spend an evening. 11/10 will recommend! [REVIEW_18] An AMAZING place to eat! Love it!!!!! You could go 100 times and never eat the same thing twice! Fresh bakery; deli; pasta; cheese & wine room; butcher; coffee bar; amazing sandwiches!!!! [REVIEW_19] This is the place for authentic Indian street food. I've been here multiple times ordering different things ranging from bhel puri; pav bhaji; vada pav; deconstructed samosa and aloo tikki; dabeli; kulfi and more. Everything was made exceptionally well.  I regret not having found this place sooner. [REVIEW_20] This is possibly my favorite sushi place in Philly. The ambiance isn't awesome; but the service is attentive; and the food is great. They have a bunch of interesting/creative rolls; and the fish is fresh and tasty. Plus the rolls are pretty large.",11
56,"[REVIEW_1] Great experience this morning at Sierra Car Care. Needed headlight and taillight replaced and Andrew was fast and the price was fair. I'm new to the area but I'll be returning here. [REVIEW_2] Amazing food and fantastic service. Get hungry; order; and repeat! Highly recommend this place if you need a Chinese fix! [REVIEW_3] when my boyfriend casually suggested we go out and rent some videos; i had to stop for a second and ask ""wait; video stores still exist? don't you have netflix?"" of course; i forgot that boyfriend is a cranky old man in training and hates technology. so; i begrudgingly agreed to go to the so-called ""video store"" -- and was pleasantly surprised!  Casa Video is awesome :) they have just about any movie you could ask for -- in DVD and VHS format (i know; who still uses VHS? oh well). They also run different promotions; such as 2 for 1 rentals on certain days; and a ""film festival"" where they list off staff picks (while i was there it was black and white movies -- very cool to see the staff members choices!)  We rented ALOT of movies while i was there -- mostly zombie movies; our favorite genre. They had ALL the obscure movies I was looking for -- including Fulchi's ""Zombi""; which i didn't see on my first lap through the shelves and was very upset that i couldn't rent it. but i was thrilled when I found it (finally!)  Staff is really nice and helpful too; they directed us to the sections where we could find weird subtitled films and exploitation films (certain horror films are considered exploitation; i guess); and even gave us free popcorn! yaay!  The only bad/weird thing is that what you see on the shelves is what they have. If it's not there; it means its rented. So; there are basically no backup copies of any movies (with the exception of new releases); so it's every movie hound for themselves.  As a bonus (for me) they had just about every B-horror movie i could dream of -- including many I had never heard of! I might have to ditch netflix for Casa Video when I move out there................maybe. [REVIEW_4] This place is absolutely delightful. I am seldom able to sneak to this part of the city; but when I do and the hour is right; I rush here. The macrons are always to die for; each melting in your mouth (even after sitting in the quaint box for a few days). The Darkness Croissant is my favorite but so rich it takes multiple sittings to consume.   The Harry Potter themed desserts brought me in yesterday where I purchased a few specialties. The Tonk's Chouquette was beautiful and light with a fun cherry center. The pumpkin pasties went great with a cup of tea. I have the Molly's Meat Pie ready to go for my lunch today. Honestly; I could have gotten one of each of the new treats if my budget allowed it.  Overall; this place makes my day each time I visit. Staff is friendly and the atmosphere is elegant. Spot on. [REVIEW_5] I've walked past here several times and loved what I saw in the window. Finally we had some time to stop today. I popped in and within 3 minutes I found two nice summer dresses! As I approached an attendant; she told me that they had a ""no backpack rule."" And that I would have to give her my purse so she could leave it on the counter. By the door. Unattended. When I told her I was not comfortable with that; she shrugged. Whelp; I'm not about to spend money on a place that treats me like a criminal for no reason. So I put the dresses that I was going to try on down and walked out. Time to hit up etsy.  Tldr; rude staff; don't bother with this place. [REVIEW_6] I went here for the first time the other day after a yelp search and wad pleasantly surprised. As others have said the fact that it's on a strip mall near the dollar store is deceiving. This place was great! I think; Joe; was the one that did my nails and I was very happy with my nails. This establishment is quite large and I sat right down as a walk in. Everyone was very friendly. I don't have anything bad to say about this place. For a mid price nail salon it was fantastic. [REVIEW_7] Food frozen with taste of freezer burn. Over priced for what you get. Nothing interesting everything is average food that can be purchased anyplace else for less money.  Love the interior everything else under average. [REVIEW_8] ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!!! I've been sitting in their drive thru a total of 20 minutes. Why have I never learned my lesson about this DD.. I do not know. But after today I will never be back again. People have to go to work... don't have time to be sitting in a drive thru for 15/20 mins [REVIEW_9] This place gets one star they need to replace the whole staff me and my friends have labeled this place as super ghetto; some servers are nice I guess but there's no structure; management doesn't know how to compensate for horrible service; I've been to other applebees and it was not like this; I would suggest new management. And If you're looking for even a little bit of class don't come here. [REVIEW_10] This place is a dirty hole.  Avoid it. They have unfriendly service; crappy beer selection and they have no problems over serving the already inebriated customers.   There is such a seedy element to this place.   In the span of 4 days; 2 men were attacked on the sidewalk after closing time.   I have nothing against guys smoking weed; but the gauntlet of smokers that you have to wade through to get in or out of the bar is just gross.  Ever notice how it's impossible to get a taxi to come to this bar? [REVIEW_11] Bought my beautiful new bike from this shop a few weeks ago then promptly crashed it (curse you; trolley tracks!). I brought it back to the shop this afternoon to see if there was any way they could try to fix the front basket; which was pretty mangled; and to give the bike a once-over to make sure it was safe to ride. I was expecting to have to leave the bike with them for a few days; but the whole process took less than a half hour. Not only did they fix the basket (not perfect; but pretty damn close); but they also fixed the gear shifter that was a little out of whack... FOR FREE.  I couldn't believe it.   I also want to note that everyone in the shop- from the owners; to the sales people on the floor; to the mechanics; to the dog that greets you at the door- is so friendly and welcoming. I am so happy I found them. [REVIEW_12] We have visited here several times.The froyo is tasty and very low calorie!  The decor is very cute; very welcoming for adults and kiddos.  We like getting our froyo and playing checkers at one of the tables sitting in the big rocking chairs.  The prices are very reasonable.  This has definitely become our go-to local place when we're craving dessert! [REVIEW_13] They offer lunch and dinner combos. Great prices. Food was ok. They play uncensored rap music through out the restaurant. No biggie I like that. Service was a D+.   Ethics...  I rated 1 star because I bought a restaurant.com gift card and was not able to use on the lunch combos. They call them ""specials"" (restaurant.com certificate not good towards specials) thus not able to get the ""everyday combos"". After factoring that I had to pay full price vs their combo price; it was pointless to use the gift card. I saved $3 vs the $15 value on the card. (Lost the $3 considering gas cost driving from Brandon in search for a good sushi joint)  Dear Sake House; you lost me forever over this combined with poor service. Maybe I'm being too critical but I for sure will never; ever be back. Specials should be specials not every day values on your standard menu. Especially if you are selling restaurant.com gift cards!!!!!!! [REVIEW_14] I had the worst duck that I have ever had.  It was so tough that I could hardly cut into it.  The cherry sauce was uninspiring at best.  My wife had a curried sole; in which the turmeric was overwhelming.  The only creditable thing was that they agreed to take the duck off my bill. [REVIEW_15] I can grant them that this is the busiest time of the year. Not my choice to move at this time; work directed. - but their consumer service takes piss poor to a new level. Instead of providing name of driver and #; all I get is he will arrive between 8-10 in the morning. Awesome! Quite possibly one of the hottest days of the year here (StL) and they may or may not start loading the truck until 10? Okey dokie.   And the delivery window is five to eleven days. All of their paper work states I asked for early delivery. I did NOT! Then the kid on the phone says easy enough to drive 2200 miles by Monday. Truck may or may not leave on Wednesday or Thursday. How dare you tell me how far I can or will drive. [REVIEW_16] I have to say you get MORE for what you pay! This hotel is clean and organized. The staff are very respectful and responsive! ALSO breakfast was excellent!! OMG eggs; sausage; waffles; OJ; you name it! [REVIEW_17] Quality of this store has gone downhill over the past few years. In the past;  I was able to easily choose from a wide selection of food at reasonable prices any time of day. I have noticed recently that the produce is not as fresh; but more expensive;  and the prices of the organic foods are more expensive than Whole Foods. This morning I debated on going to Wegmans or going to this store. I only had to get a few items so I decided on this Giant since it was closer. Big mistake. I have seen on average at least 3 or 4 people shopping around 5 a.m. In the past but today just me. They had all of the store roped off where it was impossible to get to certain aisles and very difficult to get to the register. In my frustration I went under a rope to get soup.  I was then berated by a number of people who were supposed to be cleaning the floors but some were just standing around doing nothing. I couldn't even walk out of the closest door because that was blocked off. If they needed to clean the floor they should have closed the store for a few hours. It would have taken less time at Wegmans which is where I will shop for now on. [REVIEW_18] Place is going downhill. They raised the prices but not on the menu.   Served cheese whiz instead of Swiss.  Had to get out money back. Staff was rude when questioned.  Just about threw our money back at us. [REVIEW_19] I ordered general tso chicken. Nothing but breaking. My niece ordered $78 in food to be delivered. They forgot 4 egg rolls. She called to complain. They yelled at her and would not bring her the egg rolls or refun her money. Big rip off  I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN [REVIEW_20] The place is an insult to the Asian cuisine. I love all Asian; but I never had anything like this; It was a  horrible tasteless mess;  loaded with grease and sodium .",8
57,"[REVIEW_1] Please do not go to this place. The food is just horrible. I thought of giving this place a second chance; and I was disappointed again. Not that Sitar and New Delhi are great; but they are much much better than Tandoor. Please do not torture your taste buds by going to this place. [REVIEW_2] Love the brewery! Great atmosphere. Fantastic beer! A little on the pricey side but worth it. Really wish they had more options when filling the growlers. But I still give 4 Hands 5 stars because their beer deserves it! Cheers! [REVIEW_3] I haz mad love for this place which is absolutely the GO TO place if you fancy yourself a mixologist. Or an alcoholic. And even if you aren't an alcoholic; they have so many lovely choices that you could soon be on pace to be one after talking to the super helpful staff. I had been here a few years ago and it was nowhere near the empire it is today. They have great selections of wines and liquor in a store with a relatively small footprint. I had fallen into a bad rut with my red wine habit which I was standing in front of sighing; knowing that the spark in our relationship had fizzled; but not quite being ready to break up with my go to wine. A clerk took mercy on me and suggested that if I like something that was full body but not ultra high tannins; I should try Charles Martini Cab and a Francis Ford Coppola blend. Both were amazing and sooo much better than what I had been drinking at about the same price point. I had come in with an out of state friend who was looking to get awesome whiskeys and found a better selection than Frugal McDougal's. I also picked up some new bitters for my growing bar and; don't you judge me people; some giant sippy bags of margaritas. I don't know why. They were on sale and it was pregame time of year. As I stood in the check out line looking at the oversized sippy boxes that were the equivalent of a giant glass of margarita; the checkout guy seemed to sense my doubt. He said; ""you know what these are good for?"" and I shook my head to indicate 'not really'. He then held one up to his mouth in a mock chug and said - Red lights with no cops around. It was all the wrong. So; you know. They are clearly my people. [REVIEW_4] Went here for father's day with bf's family; also for his bday!  The steak was incredible and huge. The staff was wonderful and informative about all menu items.   Must eat!!! [REVIEW_5] This place is a true gem. I had a carrot and ginger soup with the turkey and cranberry sandwich. Both were delicious (my husband won't stop talking about it)! Plus we got to meet Sabrina herself who made us feel like old friends. Highly recommend. [REVIEW_6] Really nice  hair salon with caring and professional staffs. My husband and my son all come here for their hair cuts and color.   Best hair salon in the area. [REVIEW_7] My favorite hang out for food and ambiance; speak some French; outdoors. It does not get better than that! [REVIEW_8] Several people recommended this place to us so we have it a try with a takeout pizza. It was delicious! A little thicker than traditional NY style but not ""doughy"". A few weeks later we discovered we were in the delivery area and again got a pizza and also tried the Stromboli. Everything arrived hot within the promised time frame. Stromboli was loaded with cheese and toppings. Definitely our go to pizza place! [REVIEW_9] Everything about this place is awesome.  We decided to go for Sunday brunch; and could not have been more pleased. We were initially concerned with the 25 minute wait outside; but were pleased when they called us after just 10 minutes.   I had the French toast which was outstanding; and my sister ordered the grilled cheese; which was ""one of the best she's ever had.""   The place was hopping; the staff was friendly; and they're very fast and efficient. Overall; AMAZING place to have breakfast in Tucson. [REVIEW_10] What an amazing dinner!  The wonderful ambiance of this restaurant was enough for me; but when they brought out our food; I was mesmorized by the flavors!  The owner/chef came out to greet us and he shared a nice glass of limoncello with us.  You will not be disappointed in any way if you come here for dinner.  Everything we ate tasted like the chef prepared each dish with a little bit of ""love"" in every bite. [REVIEW_11] These guys do good work; on time; and warranty their work.  I would highly recommend them! [REVIEW_12] I was just there last night. Awesome Italian restaurant. You are welcomed by the owner when you walk in who is very friendly and wants to ensure you are enjoying the meal and service. I can tell that the customer is extremely important to her and it shows as there is a decent wait; but it is worth it. This is my go to place for Italian food. Prices are reasonable and the plates plentiful. I typically get penne vodka with chicken. Their penne vodka sauce is second to none. What separates them from others is the apps are great; filling and just as much detail goes in the creation as their main dishes. Combine all this with BYOB and you can't go wrong. I never have room for dessert; maybe one day. If you want a consistent; reliable Italian restaurant this is it. [REVIEW_13] Was there today morning. Awesome place! Cosy atmosphere; tasty food; huge portions and affordable pricing! Also the coffee there is pretty good. Got very tasty cappuccino for $3.5. [REVIEW_14] Ivy is the best! I'm a male and Ivy is always up-to-date with the latest trends and hair for men. She's very talented; and if you show her a picture of the hairstyle you want; she will replicate it. Super friendly and nice; if you are a guy in the Uptown area looking for an awesome and trendy haircut/style; go to John Jay and ask for Ivy! [REVIEW_15] I loved loved loved the pizza here. I returned and got their gnocchi and it was amazing as well. Really fresh ingredients nice variety on the menu. Really felt like a small family restaurant in Europe. Best pizza in middle Tennessee. [REVIEW_16] Visited New Orleans for the end of Mardi Gras and stumbled upon this little cafe for breakfast. Ended up coming back the next two days because the food is absolutely incredible. They serve breakfast and lunch and between everyone we tried a decent portion of their menu. The boudin omelette is amazing along with the Bourbon Street Breakfast which comes with a shot of bourbon! The entire staff is great; especially our server Joe. The whole place just makes you feel like you're eating a great meal at a friend's house. I would recommend this place to ANYONE visiting NOLA who's looking for a delicious and affordable meal. I will for sure make this place a required stop on all future visits. [REVIEW_17] Really good food and great service! They have their own fish market right next door so I bought Jambalaya and Gumbo to take back to Miami! [REVIEW_18] Yesterday; our breakfast experience was the low point of our stay in Montecito. The dismissive wait staff and the manager overseeing a nearly empty room who couldn't be bothered to refill a coffee cup so eclipsed the food that we will never return. The food was decent; but the ""service"" earned our server a $2 tip. [REVIEW_19] what a wonderful place!!!!!!ive been regular customer of holt's for years;and would never go any where else!!!!this is the first;and best cigar retailer in the east coast;;;and they are the best!!!!!!!amily run;and you feel it with sincere;;caring service;;and their online store is incredible!!!!best sales and offers on a regular basis;;;;;;;;their selection and quality  is exceptional!!!!!!!!10 stars!!!!!-eric [REVIEW_20] Animo juice is the best find in Haddonfield (after the Hadrosaurus; of course!)  I stop at Animo every time I go to Jersey to visit my family; or do I visit my family every time I stop at Animo?  Debatable.  Animo started with juice.  Not frozen juices with sorbet & yogurt added.  Real juice.    Their menu has expanded & they now call themselves ""Animo Juice & Burrito Bar!""  The burrito menu features 10 burritos; all under $10; f my favorite the ""Haight & Ashbury"" is stuffed with rice; beans; meat/roasted veggies; cheese; lettuce; tomato; guacamole & sour cream.  Not that hungry; have a 'petito'; a small version of the burrito; averaging $5.  Porky & Petunia - the name is as cute as the petito is yummy:  shredded lettuce; pulled pork & pineapple salsa.    A breakfast petito & Animo MD juice destroy any hangover.  The MD is juiced greens; carrot; orange; apple; kiwi; banana & spirolina.   My BF loves the Chilly Palmer:  Acai; apple; banana; yogurt & flax seed.    For a happy belly add or substitute the perfectly cooked quinoa to any dish.  The Border Salad is a perfect example: lettuce; guac; pico de gallo; cheese; tortilla chips; cilantro lime vin; & sub quinoa for meat.     Fiber-full signature juices; frozen whipped bananas; sliced fresh wheat grass (cheaper than Jameson!) & yogurt/granola bowls!    The city's juice bars have something to learn from Animo.",18
58,"[REVIEW_1] Was contacted by this company from an inquiry I did for a moving quote for North American Moving Company.  The representative came to my house on Monday and it took 4 days for actually to receive the moving quote estimate.  When received the quote saw many charges on it for services that I didn t asked for and things in it that never seen before on an estimate.  When called the representative about this had no clue about any of the charges.    To me seems that they are a rip off company and trying to make the most money possible the easiest way !    I advice anyone to stay away from this company and do your research well before deciding to hire any moving company.    Oh; I also forgot that the moving quote I received was outrageous and ridiculous ! [REVIEW_2] This is my favorite restaurant in the world. Hands down.  Here's why:  1- Old and nothing has changed 2- The cheeseburger. It's a fish place; I know -  trust me; get the cheeseburger 3- The smoked fish spread appetizer 4- Root beer /draft beer in ice-cold mugs 5- Touring the fish house 6- Oh; and the german potato salad  For real; this place will change your life. [REVIEW_3] I work at Supercuts next to Jeannines and last week a worker from here delivered a box of bundtinis as a promotion and they were absolutely to die for. They were so moist and delicious! Love love loved it [REVIEW_4] Just got home from my LONG drive to Philadelphia PA. I had a house full of guests  and the general consensus for dinner was island cuisine. Unfortunately; I forgot that this is the Penn Relay weekend (huge mistake). After driving 1.5 hour and taking 30 minutes to find a $15 parking space; I finally arrived. The place was not too packed but half the patrons were gathered around the ordering counter. It took me a few minutes to realize that this increadibly roudy; vulgar bunch had aready placed their orders but were just hanging out at the counter; thus preventing newly arrived customers from placing their orders. I tried my best to get noticed and to get to the counter but had no luck. Ultimately; I and a few other customers (or should I say ""potential customers"" eventually gave up and left. The cincher for me was that the staff were clearly aware of what was occurring but made no attempt to control the crowd. I may have waited if the staff showed some business savvy and kept the counter area clear but unfortunately; they appeared overwhelmed and confused. i've eaten at the Jerk Hut several times (food is OK-good) but this visit left a bad taste in my mouth so I may have to reconsider future trips across the bridge for authentic JA CUISINE!! PS: Memo from prior visits; their wait staff can be a bit rude. [REVIEW_5] The only good thing about this place is they kept my water glass full. Definitely don't get the Caesar salad because it's not a Caesar salad.  However they were nice enough to take it off the bill. [REVIEW_6] First of all i wasn't greeted . Then we was serve on dirty trays that was wiped with dirty rags . Also the restroom was disgusting as well as table and chairs we sat on. Sorry but will not be coming back and definitely spreading the word of this place. [REVIEW_7] I've been to five other juice bars in the Tampa Bay Area. This is the only one that has my business! Great quality. Ironically the prices at other juice bars are higher. This place is legit. [REVIEW_8] I am so angry with myself for having foolishly fallen for their sign-up offer. They made it seem so simple and it was tied to my American Airlines account so I was even offered bonus airline miles as a sign-up incentive. They've been charging me over 19cents kWh for well over two years now. I wasn't even aware that other companies charge between 9 - 10 cents. I'm angry at myself for not canceling much sooner. I just got off the phone with them now to cancel and was told that it ""will take one to two billing cycles for the cancelation to officially go through"" so I will be paying a fortune for some time more. I recall it was instantaneous to START an account with them. Why the difference?   Great. Right in the middle of the summer. Stay far away from this company; people. [REVIEW_9] This restaurant has definitely seen better days.  Pricey; attitude; garish recent redecoration; terrible food.  Too bad; because for years it was a quality; friendly; well-managed place--best in Harahan.  Bring Rodney back! [REVIEW_10] BEWARE before you are the next victim! Firestone burned out a cylinder  in a brand new starter on a 2004 Mercedes Benz C230; by the mechanics that dont know what they are doing costing me an extra $500.00 plus; $460.00; with an alternator from AUTO ZONE which is no good and don't last long. I had the starter replaced at Kaufman about a year ago. I have contacted 8 ON MY SIDE and BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU for an investigation on  these dishonest and untruthful employee at Firestone. The car started 3 times at Firestone location with no issues with my starter; after being towed.. The next day I had received a call from an employee about my car's starter was smoking after they repaired an alternator and battery. I wonder what Firestone did to my car.  I had reported that an alternator that was done at Firestone was giving lot of problem 6 months ago; with no help and resolution. I will NEVER return to any Firestone or Firestone on Bruce B. Downs and I am disappointed and filing a complaint for justice. [REVIEW_11] We are in the middle of a coast to coast road trip; and spent a long day in St. Louis with 3 small kids; so I was grateful to find this place on Yelp.  It was near our hotel; and was a perfect mix of tasty food and kid-friendly in a grown-up environment. Saw lots of couples on dates as well.   The full-sized power salad was huge and tasty; kids' chicken strips were made from real white meat chicken (and were delicious); and the burgers were amazing. Fries and sides were creative. Service was prompt; friendly; and very welcome after a hot; exhausting day. Ice cream was home-made and creamy.   Perfect! [REVIEW_12] Best mac n cheese I've had in a long time! It's called ""The Wedge"". The top was nice and crispy; the cheese to noodle ratio was on point and the flavor was just amazing. They didn't use the regular elbow macaroni though; but whatever they used was great.   The red beans and rice were good too; they came with chicken sausage.   Everyone else got hamburgers and liked them. They also had a $5 drink special. [REVIEW_13] this place is worth the wait on weekends. the biggest problem with this place is trying to figure out what yummy food to try this time [REVIEW_14] I have been here twice. They just opened about 3 weeks ago. Our food and service was good and I hope they stick around! BYOB The soups are delicious especially the #1 soup w the seafood.  Very friendly staff.  They need to have their sign out up out front!  They are tucked away on the side of the shopping complex and easy to miss. [REVIEW_15] Worst sushi experience EVER. Disgusting.  Spicy tuna was processed not fresh. Sashimi tasted frozen.  Rolls that were supposed to be hot came cold; pre-made; almost buffet style. If you are a sushi enthusiast DON'T waste your time & money. Service terrible; waitress has never even heard of a quail egg. [REVIEW_16] I am a newbie to Philly from a foodie town boasting a few Iron Chef winners. This is my favorite places to go to. There are options for everyone; and the food is prepared with such quality my mouth waters just waiting for it. The servers and staff are wonderful and very cheerful. The meals here are always enjoyed. [REVIEW_17] The BEST hotdogs around! No lie! I used to say down town LA or pinks Hotdogs were the best! But nope!  Daves dogs are BOMB! Plus he has something different on his (secret menu) every week!  Staff is really nice! I go at least once a week! [REVIEW_18] I was there tonight and had the bruschetta and eggplant rollatini as appetizers and the the vodka gnocchi with out pancetta (by special request). The food was amazing; the service was great and we were definitely treated like family. Will be going back for sure :) [REVIEW_19] I absolutely love Jimmy Johns. I will never come back to this one.  They screwed up my ordered and their first response was ""Sorry; we can't take the sandwich back after its served. That's a health code violation.""   Too many places that care about my business for that crap. [REVIEW_20] This is the worst. My first time at an Econo anything. Playing nice for group purposes. We get here. They check us in like the rooms are clean. The rooms are dirty. The lady comes to clean the room because apparently they dont have any others clean or available. Go figure. So the manager comes outside to look as if we are lying about dirty rooms. It's hot as hell outside; wasps everywhere and we're standing here. I asked about other clean rooms and he (a-hole manager) (neil Patel) sarcastically states check in is at 2. It's 1:45 though. If you're going to check guest in at least make sure the rooms are clean or let them know it will be a few. So I'm standing outside in the heat as they apparently clean the room.  They took no cleaner in to clean counters; bathroom; etc. Just nasty. Then they just looked in the microwave & fridge to see if it was clean. They didn't wipe nothing. I would never stay at this filthy mofo or any Econo Lodge. Just nasty. Go w/ a big brand like Marriot; Starwood or Hilton where customer satisfaction is part of their branding scope. This -ish is for the birds and folks who need a place for a quickie.... Not even that.",10
59,"[REVIEW_1] I could make a jacks pizza taste better than their pizza with little effort.  We ordered two pizzas both horrible. Taste like cheap ingredients. Shouldn't be around long. [REVIEW_2] ""Feather free"" in my profile.  ""Feather free"" in my reservation.  ""Feather free"" by special request when I called four hours before arrival.  ""Feather free"" confirmed upon check in.  In the room?  Feathers.  Will Hyatt ever understand how important this is?  Will it take another trip to the emergency room?   And $29/night to park also absurd for St. Louis.  ""Sorry about that sir"" gets old. [REVIEW_3] So we walk in and the receptionist Vann was   absolutely incompetent at his job;  we simply asked if there was any vacancy to which he replied with out any computer or paperwork check ""NO""  so we walk out and do a online search and booked a room to that same hotel!  We Came back confronted him about it to which he replied ""he didn't know anything about it""   Well Van if you don't know the only thing you are being paid to do; I suggest a you find a new profession. [REVIEW_4] LYING SCAMMERS. BAIT AND SWITCH. Will try and take advantage of you! Online coupon says 15$ for unlimited tanning any bed for a week for first time customers. Went to Chippewa location; The lady behind the desk acted like she had no idea what I was talking about. Then I pulled up the coupon and she said it's only for students and that I needed a student ID. However the coupon said nothing about this. Then she switched to saying the coupon is expired; yet it's still on YELP and they're website. She also said they won't honor the $75 for 45$ coupon you can literally purchase on yelp either. Just bullshit line after bullshit line. I then left And called creve coeur location and the lady there says; ""yes you can still use that coupon; but you must go to the same location each time for that week once you choose a location."" I knew this as my girlfriend used it last week. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!! [REVIEW_5] When I first walked in; it seemed an ok place but by the time I realized it was a mistake to get mani and pedi done here; it was too late. I got shellac done and they applied 10-12 coats of paint and gel.  It started peeling off in 3-4 days.  My nails look all rough after the nail paint has peeled off. Also; the people working there were talking to each other in Mandarin.  I felt really awkward there. They used some neon green colored massage lotion or something.  Ewww.  I am never going back! [REVIEW_6] Terrible service. My friends and I waited at least a half hour for a drink. We were at the FRONT of the bar and were ignored time after time after time!!! We kept waving for the bar tender; however he seemed to be high on his horse and served everyone else but us. We were about to walk over to another bar when he finally asked what we wanted. I told him how long we had been waiting and that we kept waving him down. He disregarded our comment. We just walked away because I did not want to be served by this rude man. There is no place to sit unless you have a VIP table; which is terrible. I've been there twice since they have opened and have not had a good time there. Hire new staff that actually know what guest service is. [REVIEW_7] Awful food! Don't go to this place. Jambalaya was cold; looked like a fast food!!!! We ordered a non spicy fish. It came like hell hot overloaded with hot sauce. The server simply said it was not her fault; but the chef...I thought everyone working in the same place were supposed to be one team and not one blaming the other....bad bad bad behavior.... [REVIEW_8] Hands down favorite sub place around. The atmosphere is fun with the fire fighter theme- they totally roll with It from the table decor to the names of the subs. Who doesn't love a hot sub!? They are by far more unique than subway or jimmy johns or any other sub place. They don't have many bread options but the toppings and wide selection of hot sauces makes up for that- talk about flavor! I love the sub machine with the over 120 drink options but with only one machine it takes forever to get your drink.... But at least you can make it special! Every time I go here it's packed! The customer service is great; I love that they walk your meal to you; it's better than standing around or having a pager. They also do boxed lunches or catering which is always a great addition to any party. [REVIEW_9] The worst body shop ever. They will blame you for their mistake. Don't go here if you have a Mercedes or BMW.  Honestly they did a good job on the paint but they are careless. They scratched up my leather seats; drain my battery; and my panels is not installed right. [REVIEW_10] Suzie is great! Professional; efficient; personable. Everything you'd want in an aesthetician. I've been going to her for years and I will for years to come. [REVIEW_11] Oh my word; this place was awful. It takes a lot to be a one star review; but this joint deserves it.  I'm not even sure where to start. The menu was really strange; with one dish for each type of protein and one very random Thai dish. They were out of the fish; and since steak and chicken didn't sound good; I went with two appetizers as my main dish. Very odd; but the menu was SO small and SO overpriced it's all that appealed.  The meals that arrived were almost worthy of a joke; if we weren't so pissed we were paying for it. My shrimp cocktail consisted of 4 butterflied shrimp that were rather warm. My hubby's ""roasted half chicken"" was actually two grilled chicken breasts--which does not equal by any stretch of imagination; a roasted 1/2 chicken. The drink menu was limited as was the wine list. Dessert was just dumb--the only choice was cupcakes--expensive and only came in portions for two. I'm all for friendly service; but our server was waaaay to open and honest with us. It was rather odd. We learned all about her former employment at Starbucks. What? We spent more on our lame meal than we have in long time. I believe it was around$115. We were shocked. What takes the cake though; is the bathroom gender identifiers--each has a wall decal of a dog; one is sitting and labeled ""Setters"" and one is standing and labeled ""Pointers."" Classy. I'm not sure how this place will stay open much longer; we were the only diners in the main dining room on a Saturday night. Not a good sign. [REVIEW_12] My husband and I stopped here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon around 2-ish.  The restaurant was completely empty.  We inquired if they were even open and a nice lady said they were and proceeded to seat us.   Their menu did not offer as many options of meat types or dishes as most Mexican restaurants do here in Indianapolis.  My husband ordered a margarita and the special of the day; Chilaquilles con salsa verde y pollo at $6.99 and I ordered a carne asada burrito at $7.99 and water to drink. Chips and salsa were brought to the table.  Chips were  fried there; and while I like that style of chip (thin; often bubbles into thin layers) but were cold and very greasy.  Salsa was sweet but had some heat in the finish.  It was easy to eat a lot of those! When our meals came to the table; frankly; they were underwhelming.  My burrito tortilla looked/felt like it was not heated at all and cutting into my burrito was disappointing.  There was lots of lettuce and tomato; a scoop of a white rice (not spanish rice) and there was supposed to be mozzarella cheese in it but couldn't taste or see it.  The carne asada was thinner than a strip of bacon.  Unfortunately; I would be generous in saying there was maybe 2 ounces of beef.  In all honesty; there was no more meat in it than two strips of bacon; diced.  My husband mentioned it to the person (owner) with a quick ""sorry"" muttered and no offer to do anything.   While the combination of ingredients was not improperly prepared; there are 100 other Mexican restaurants in town I can spend $8.00 on a burrito and it would be generously filled with meat. As for my husband's chilaquilles; I order this all the time from Biscuits in Broad Ripple and this was another disappointment.  This was chips; salsa verde; one fried egg and a very thin boneless piece of grilled chicken.  My husband felt as I did.  Not poorly prepared but completely lacking any substance.  During the time we spent in this restaurant; there was not one other customer coming or going.  With the lack of substance to the food; I suspect most people will feel as I did and would not waste their time coming back here.  There is no way this restaurant can survive when prices are the same as other Mexican restaurants but quality is far less.  Sadly; I was even mad that we spent $25.00 at this place and left just to drive to a fast food restaurant so we could get some quick; cheap protein.   I will chalk this up to a learning experience.  Folks; save your money and go to Rosita's or Margaritas U.S. 31; Leonardo's or even El Meson. [REVIEW_13] Just left there...horrible service and miserable employees.  WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN. Miss Baja fresh. [REVIEW_14] How this place gets so many stars I just don't know.  Devil's food cake with cheap icing and chocolate shavings does not make a great cake.  If you are in a pinch for a good cake go to the Whole Foods at 20th & Callowhill and they can generally letter up a birthday cake for you with a quickness. [REVIEW_15] I brought my cousin here on Christmas night. The food/beers were great; and the waitress was friendly.   Several hours after I left; I realized that I had left my phone on the table. I drove back and asked the security guard who was standing outside Brew Brothers if they had found a phone; ""I haven't heard about any phone; I would check down stairs with security.""   The security office also denied having found a phone. I went home and used ""find my iPhone"". It was still in the casino. I put it on ""lost mode"" - setting my best friend's number as the call back.    My friend; Alex; went back the next morning to try and find it. (I was at work; but kept a close eye for any changes on the map via laptop).   He went up to the brew brothers; and spoke to the manager (bald with a beard).   ""I was the manager that was on last night; and I assure you there was no phone found last night."" My friend then walked down to security; they hadn't found it.  Meanwhile I was incessantly using the ""play sound"" function via my laptop. At some point Alex was called. Someone said ""hello""... then hung up.   Alex went back to brew brothers and was like ""I know it's in there.""   ""Ummmm... alright let me check"". He came out with it in hand; and was acting sketchy. ""It was making noise and scaring the employees so we turned it off."" [REVIEW_16] DO NOT GO THERE . The male waiter was only looking at my 7 year old daughter and I tried to get his attention  away but couldn't; a real creeper. The cook in the back looked in our direction and laughed. Will never go back  . Horrible place. please help to rip those guys a new one. [REVIEW_17] Have eaten here twice now on two separate trips to Nashville and each meal has been fantastic. The first trip I got the sweet potato pancakes which are so fluffy it is like they are made with clouds Delicious. The second go round I got some eggs and sausage which of course comes with a side of pancakes. Not only are the pancakes great but everything else was cooked perfectly and served with whipped butter that was probably made in heaven. My son got the wild blueberry pancakes which were equally fantastic. Get there before 8 AM and you shouldn't have to wait in the lines out the door. Make sure you get a free parking pass to put on the dash of your car as well. Great experience and worth getting up early for. Probably worth the wait too but I'm not into waiting in the snow like most folks on our first trip there! [REVIEW_18] I went to the drive thru hopefully I can get served so was at the speaker for half hour and lady had a attitude cause we asked if we could get service to say they had to change till and several cars left in the process I had to go home hungry that was totally sad luckily I not a diabetic [REVIEW_19] I ordered the Pulled Pork Nachos.  They were delicious!  Instead of tortilla chips they are served with potato chips...perfect to share with a Beer or Bloody Mary [REVIEW_20] I've been here a few times with no issues... this time was horrible! I guess because they were working on my teen they assumed they could cut corners and do a horrible;  sloppy job.  Word to the wise drive up a few blocks to LA nails at Bustleton/Bowler for real service.",4
60,[REVIEW_1] I been to a lot of places but this place was gross. I am sorry to say but there was hair in my good and the waitress was rude. [REVIEW_2] Awful noise and constant interruptions by staff to ask how things are going.  Ridiculous dancing. Etc. never again...goy a headache in about 10 minutes! [REVIEW_3] Came in at 9:59 am when they open at 10 am; door was unlocked and everything but they lady was very rude and told us they weren't open. Walked out a couple steps turned around and she had flicked the open sign on. Decided not to walk back because of the poor customer service. [REVIEW_4] Ok had Sunday lunch with my mother and grandmother here and it was just terrible. Our server didn't even tell us his name and took forever for him to take our drink order. We asked for sweet and low with one of our unsweet teas and didn't receive it. Had to ask for it again to then receive the sweet and low. We ordered the bloomin onion and the chesse fries. The bloomin onion was not the onion the restaurant usually uses because it was on the spicy side. The chesse fires when on the ok side since they did not put much chesse or bacon on the appetizer. So in all reality we ordered a plate of fires with a little chesse and bacon. My grandmother ordered the 6oz steak and it was also on the spicy side. I however ordered the same thing but I ordered mine medium rare but when I got my steak it was rare instead of medium rare and also was really spicy.  We then had to ask for a bottle of steak sauce because if you ask for steak sauce for a party of three you will only get one tiny cup full of steak sauce for the whole table. Had to order a to go order for my father couldn't make it to lunch and our waiter said he would put it in after we had finished our meal. When we finished our food and the waiter gave us our check we still haven't received our to go order. Had to sit and extra five to ten minutes to get that said order. Lets just say we gave a bad tip. Be caution to this place not worth a hundred dollar bill for a spicy mouth and bad experience! [REVIEW_5] This is the best Caribbean food in town; hands down. Everything was so fresh; not too heavy; cooked to perfection. My fiancé had stewed chicken and I had the curried chicken- both were excellent. I also had an order of plantains that were the best I've ever had. The owner came out to chat and made sure we'd gotten enough food and liked everything.   The prices are incredible; and evidently there are some things not on the menu; such as oxtails; that are available.   Also- it's a BYOB!  Will definitely return and tell everyone I know to try this place out. Worth every 5-star review- they're real; folks. [REVIEW_6] Incredibly unfriendly staff. The place a filthy disaster. Dirty dishes all over the place. Trash bags sitting out like someone attempted to change the trash. They were out of many things at the drink area (lids; napkins). Used the lack of a cook as an excuse for all their issues but positioned it as an inconvenience to them and not apologetic to customers at all. [REVIEW_7] Bad service!  We decided to eat in to take advantage of their byob option and have dinner without cleanup.  The three of us walked in and a fee of the staff members lifted their heads to look but otherwise didn't acknowledge our presence. No hi; how are doing-just a look. We seated ourselves; waited a few minutes then grabbed our own menus.  We waited a few minutes longer and still no acknowledgment; no wine glasses-nothing!  We walked out!  It's a shame because I really like their pizza... [REVIEW_8] The is the biggest SCAM!!!! Do not order from this company! I paid $134.00 for merchandise I NEVER received. There is NO one that answers the phone and you cannot leave a message. [REVIEW_9] I'm not going to be returning to Santa Fe for a while. I just didn't like it; flat out. I've been before for chips and salsa and margaritas; and that was just ok; but I went recently for a full meal and I just cannot get past the fact that the tuna on my yellowtail tostada was cooked hopefully that morning or maybe even the day before; but it was not fresh. It had a congealed coat on the outside of it and it was cold; so I know it came from the fridge. The salad it sat on; iceberg; was so ordinary; it completely downgraded the dish. Haven't they discovered the beauty of baby mixed greens; they are pretty and make every salad seem a lot classier. The best part of the meal were the chips and salsa. Kind of sad really. In my opinion; fresh is always better and when it comes to fish; fresh should be the only option!!! [REVIEW_10] This place has good food. However; the customer service is terrible. I arrived at around 7:30 pm on a Thursday and I wanted to order a take out appetizer or meal. First; I asked them what was the meal of the day. A waitress told me that they don't have any left. Ok that was understandable. Then I asked the same waitress if I can order meat pies (arayes). She said that this will take 40 minutes to make it ready. She pointed to a group of people sitting of about 25 persons and implied that they were busy making food for them. Afterwards; I asked her what about just a regular appetizer like hummus and baba gannoush. She again said that they need 40 minutes to prepare it! Also she pointed at the same group of people with her finger.  At that point I just left the restaurant.  It is horrendous that they needed 40 minutes to prepare hummus!! It is very obvious that they were overwhelmed and didn't want to waste their time on a small order. Very unprofessional and very unwelcoming! Very bad service! [REVIEW_11] Just had lunch with family here today. Awful service. First; steaks were not cooked as we had asked. Second; they ran out of our sides and instead of asking us before they brought the food out if we would like to substitute or wait for it to come out with our meal. They just brought out our meal and said it'd be 15 minutes for the rest. Asked for manager; manager trivialized our concern. Tried to explain their communication process as if it wasn't their fault. When I told her that this should have been communicated to us first; she gave up and stated flatly what we wanted her to do. I don't know? Why don't you tell me what you're going to do. Don't expect your customer to handle your problem. As a manager; take initiative and fix the problem. After that; we had a free appetizer on our phone. Waitress took phone instead of writing it down. (Seriously people; this is a liability on your end if the phone breaks or there is privacy issues.) And failed to use it. So charged another person the appetizer in an attempt to hide the fact. Seriously; stay away from this one. Usually have a good time at other Texas Roadhouses. Never going back to this one. [REVIEW_12] So disappointed; I'm so embarrassed! This is a $50 mixed bouquet! Trader Joe's makes better arrangement! Mostly green filler with a couple mum; iris and Gerber daisy. [REVIEW_13] I visited Just Cookies to get some chocolate chip cookies for a friend and I before a concert at the (awesome) Murat.  Specialty bakeries are the best; unfortunately; this place was the worst.  For cookies at this price; they should be better than the discount day-old cookies at the supermarket..  much better; even!  But these were; somehow; worse.  Not just dry; but bland.  I couldn't believe that a bakery specializing on just one item could do them so poorly.  And while the woman was not explicitly rude; she certainly wasn't friendly either (not even a smile.)  To Just Cookies; I'll Just say No! [REVIEW_14] Amber tried to give us old fries and weren't having it. Cold and burnt; we are not the ones. Get it together. [REVIEW_15] No military discount for my son headed to Kuwait to serve our county! Shame on you all! All other places were happy to give the standard discount. Unacceptable! [REVIEW_16] They served me a frozen pizza and skunked beer.  'Nuff said. [REVIEW_17] I've been doing DIP powder for years. Every time it lasts 3-6 weeks without chipping. I did my nails here for the second time and within a week I had two broken nails. I went back and they fixed it but within two days more nails were chipping off. The pedicures are nice with the stones but after spending almost $70 in everything and my nails looking this bad after only a week I will not be going back here again. [REVIEW_18] Service was pretty slow. Actually; it was painfully slow. I would recommend going anyplace else. McDonald's would be better. [REVIEW_19] I have not been to PF Changs in about five years. But last time I was there it was great. This experience the other day was not so good. Food has gone downhill and the service was terrible. We had pad Thai and beef Szechuan and both were subpar. There are a lot better restaurants out there than this. I will not be going back. [REVIEW_20] Wait staff was pleasant but food took forever even though it wasn't remotely busy. Burger bun too soggy .....fries have a funky dust on them. Everything was super salty or greasy.   What is all the hype about?   Not cheap either.  Terrible.  Stay away.  Seriously.   BTW.  Two hours later and my husband and I are both feeling queasy. Thank goodness for Alka Seltzer,1
61,"[REVIEW_1] Would give zero stars if possible. Carries literally zero lefty golf clubs for juniors. Does this corrupt corporation think that it's okay to discriminate against 10% of the world population? I will; most definitely; never be returning to this store again. Also; Jared; the man who helped me; was an absolute asshole. Would not recommend at all. Didn't even have bike parking. [REVIEW_2] 1  only because you can't give NO stars!  I do not think I have ever had a worse breakfast in my life!  I ordered a ham & cheese omelette with home fries and white toast. The menu says the omelette is made with 3 extra large eggs but it was clearly made with liquid egg product. The omelette was swimming in grill oil and absolutely tasteless!  The home fries had absolutely no seasoning and were equally as tasteless as the omelette. The only thing worse than the food was the conversation going on with the employees about someone's ""bloody bowel movement""!  Do yourself a favor and keep on moving to the next breakfast place! [REVIEW_3] Very disappointed. Store hours online need to be updated; showed up at 8pm thinking they were open until 9pm and the doors were locked. There is a sign on the door that says ""Fall hours"" are only until 8pm... [REVIEW_4] I lived in Philadelphia about 10 years ago and loved Dmitris.  It was always a long wait but the food was great and service good.  I was back in town for a 15th year college reunion and decided to reminisce by coming here again on a MONDAY night for a good friend's birthday celebration.  When I arrived at 6:30pm - the restaurant had many empty seats.  We were a party of 5 but only 3 of us arrived early.  We were seated immediately.  The rest of the party came about 20 minutes later.  After 5 minutes - our waitress came over with an irritated ""Is the rest of your party coming soon?""  After another 5 minutes - they basically said very rudely ""Where are they?""  Meanwhile - there were still MANY empty tables (another table of 5 open) - I looked and there was nobody waiting.    When the rest of the party arrived; the waitress came over immediately to announce the specials of the day before my brother's butt touch his seat!  They're undercurrent was still hostile at best.  The restaurant did not fill up until 30 minutes after our entire party arrived and no more than 2 people were waiting at a time to be seated the entire time we were there.  I felt that the waitresses were rude and acted like it was some kind of sacred privilege to eat at Dmitris.  To add insult to injury - the food was NOT the way I remembered it.  The grilled octopus was dry and did not taste fresh.  The rest of the dishes were okay-good but not spectacular.  I feel that Dmitris is resting on its previous laurels.  I read a few yelp reviews and many complained about the rude waitstaff.  I will not patronized this establishment again and informed my Philly friends and family of the same.  This is America and who wants to pay to eat at a snooty mediocre place? [REVIEW_5] I would've given it no stars at all if this were an option. My wife ordered cheesecake and coffee. The cheesecake was ridiculously tiny and the coffee tasted like dirt. I ordered a chicken pesto sandwich which was simply about-to-go-bad chicken on stale bread. The only Ok thing about this restaurant was the veggies; they did look and taste fresh. But that's about it. I do not recommend at all. [REVIEW_6] I made reservations and they had trouble seating us when we arrived. With a hungry 1 year old toddler this did not go over well. The staff did try to accommodate us while we waited. They offered a cup of ice...which was weird or crayons for our little one. Finally; we were seated and the waitress was great. She took our drink and dinner order immediately. Then it went down hill from there. My husbands steak was awful. We found a long hair (not mine) in our daughters food. Over priced and Wendy's food would have tasted better. Save your time and money. [REVIEW_7] We are choice rewards members and this by far is the worst property that we have ever stayed at and we travel a lot.  I wasted my reward points staying there because their pictures of the property were so deceiving. There was mold all over the bathroom light and ceiling.  Chunks of drywall missing from the walls.  The bathroom smelled like urine.  Their were people smoking;  screaming and running down the halls way after 10 pm and then back at it at 7am. We were told that we were lucky to get the room we got because they were booked up but the parking lot was half empty. Very disappointed and a waste of points. [REVIEW_8] Best pho in Tampa...by far!!  Fresh squeezed orange juice and coconut juice with fresh coconut! [REVIEW_9] I have had Pizza hut before at a different location and I don't remember the service ever being this horrible. We ordered delivery. They were late; we called them multiple times and the manager would not come to the phone except on the last try. When he finally spoke to us; he blamed us and said we didn't pick up the phone and that he left a voicemail. I immediately knew he was lying since   1. if he called us the multiple times he said we would have received the call 2. if he left a voicemail message THERE WOULD BE A VOICEMAIL MESSAGE  DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS LOCATION. THE MANAGER TRIES TO PLACE BLAME ON CUSTOMERS; LIES AND DOES NOT KNOW WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS!! [REVIEW_10] What a disappointment. Not what most expect with jazz bar/dining establishment. Not dark or comfy seating. I got a mojito and I do not think they could spare the mint. They had a sign about a cover charge at 8. They came over and said if we were still there at 8 eating we would be charged. The food was nothing special. It was about equal with Zattarans box foods. The shrimp they served in the jambalaya and gumbo could not be smaller. Service was lacking. They may want to look at improving the food and entertainment to fill their very empty establishment before they focus on a cover charge. To add the music was not worth the five and was not really jazz bar type. The bar was also cheaply done. If they do not change they will be gone in six months.  Hmmm trying to find a positive kids menu was decently priced. [REVIEW_11] Went because a friend ask me to meet her there. It lived up to all the bad reviews given. It was 7pm 3 people at the bar; bartender playing on her phone & talking to her friend at the end of the bar. No hello; can I get you something? After standing at the bar for a while she finally came over. I ordered a beer which she handed me unopened. I paid and walk to the table my friend and 3 others were sitting. At about 8pm 15 very young people walked in and had an even longer wait for her to even acknowledge there presence. I was guessing for Karaoke which doesn't start till 9pm. I left at 8:30pm. I have no idea how they stay in business and certainly don't know how she makes any money. Clearly the owner is not interested in making this a place to go. I went to the Old Double D many many years ago and I bet the original owner is glad he's gone-he should have never let them keep the name. [REVIEW_12] I was very disappointed with my recent stay here. I've been quite happy with SPG/Aloft hotels normally but this Aloft was just awful. The entire facility was poorly kept and generally dirty. The occupants of the neighboring room were up until the early morning (3am) smoking & drinking inside/outside their room. The staff conveyed overall apathy and did little to nothing as a result. Save yourself a headache and look for a better option if staying around here. [REVIEW_13] I thought this was a great addition to downtown St. Pete and was thrilled to have a local place with an extensive selection of spices being that I am a cook. However; the owners are gay hating bigots! This isn't a review on the shop or the product; but a review to let the LGBT community to stay away! I have shopped a few times and each time have been treated differently than the straight people shopping in the shop. The only reason I returned was to make sure my feeling was right. The male owner each time refuses to come from behind the counter to assist me. Its as if he fears he'll catch some disease by talking to a homosexual. Furthermore; I have been there with straight friends and each time have been ignored even though I am the one who need assistance in locating a certain spice. The one time his wife was around she intentionally (and randomly I might add) brought up a conversation about Chick-fil-a and MItt Romney. Again; this isn't a negative review on the shop and its contents but on the owners who cannot refrain from hiding their hatred towards a large part of the Tampa Bay community.  For those wanting to support an anti-hateful local business there are plenty on central and if you need gourmet spices visit The Fresh Market; Rollin' Oats or Earth Organics. [REVIEW_14] For the time and effort I put into ordering online 30 minutes before my pickup; I was pretty disappointed to skip the long line only to be told they 'didn't have anything' in their system. Thanks for nothing. [REVIEW_15] this place should really get a -1 star for inconsistent service. I've been here for a couple occasions but this time was the absolute worst. So bad I had to create a Yelp account to write a review. That's how piss I was leaving the restaurant.   Long story short; we ordered the enormous nachos which they now down sized to a smaller portion than what it use to be. Not to mention guacamole use to be included but now it's an additional dollar. We also ordered 20 piece wings but when it came out; there was only 19 pieces. (Not that we intentionally counted but there was 5 of us And we agreed everyone was going to get 4 each; equaling 20) We brought it to our servers attention who disappeared for long periods of a time. It seemed like we always had to look around to try to find him and flag him down. It was very annoying; the server to the table next to us was more attentive to his table than ours was to ours. 15 mins gone by after we told him; still nothing. Finally he came back and by this time we just wanted our check. When we recieved our check we were still charged full price for the wings. Whatever; it's just 1 wing but the more we thought about it the more we got upset because it seemed as tho they didn't care about customer service much. We seemed like a joke to them complaining about a missing wing. My bf flagged down the manager and when we brought it to his attention; he basically blew us off and said ""I'll take off a dollar for you."" Now that was insulting. Then out of nowhere our server came over with a plate with just 1 wing on it since he seen us looking for the manager. We don't give a daym about the wing. This is poor customer service. If we would have went anywhere else; they would have apologized for the mistake which we all would have understood; it happens. Then asked us if we needed anything and immediately replaced what was missing and on top of that added some more. Now that's customer service. For what they did; we will not becoming back ever again. It was a daym joke.   So you have been warned; do not go here and expect good service because they really don't give a daym about you. It was a rip off. [REVIEW_16] If I could give this subway 0 stars; I would. The only reason I'm not overcome with guilt of misleading people with the extra star is because once in a while; once you suffer through the ordering experience; the food is somewhat tasty. Sometimes.   I am surprised to see more reviewers didn't comment specifically on the chain smoking; smug; openly mocking rude sandwich maker that seems to always be the only employee. A few did; but not all.   This man COMPLETELY ruins the subway experience. He laughs at you the whole time you order; moves so slow; doesn't respond when spoken to; and gives the most disturbing looks. I do not understand how he keeps his job; unless he's also the owner; and in that case I don't understand how he runs the business.  Go to the wawa up the street if you need a fresh hoagie. [REVIEW_17] Waited 3 hours between buying the tickets and enter to the haunted asylum; it was not scary at all and it just lasts 13 minutes. Not worth it.  While waiting in line; someone started to throw balls and it hit a few people. [REVIEW_18] Eggplant Grinder and Greek salad are off the chain! The pizza is excellent! [REVIEW_19] I really had a wonderful experience at the Nashville location; and we found out that New Orleans had one now and should go to it. Last night we got there kinda late around 10pm. Sat there for 10min and not one person greeted us. Went to the bar to see about service and she informed that the kitchen was behind on completing orders.  I had to apologize to my friends that we may not get any food after driving three hours down to enjoy the weekend. We did end up leaving the restaurant after 25 min wait for no service or an apology.   I have to say this not what I expected from a big known place for adults to have fun along with kids also. Please do something about this. I hope this is not a reflection of how others could become. [REVIEW_20] Came for all-you-can-eat; and ended up waiting for over half an hour to get our order in. The servers completely ignored us; while taking orders from the tables around us. And on top of that; all of the rolls contain ""extras"" not listed on the menu. One roll surprised us by having sweet mustard sauce on it; which did NOT taste very good.... On the bright side; once we actually got our orders in they didn't take all that long to make them.",2
62,"[REVIEW_1] I would let you punch me in the kidneys if you brought me some gelato.  The flavors are seasonal; but everything here is delicious.  None of the flavors taste awkward or forced.  Even the kiwi gelato was delicious.  Have you ever tried adding kiwi to a milkshake?  Don't.  Let the flavor craftsmen at Frost handle it for you.  They won't disappoint.  The creamy gelatos and refreshing sorbettos are all great.  I have literally sampled every single flavor they have to offer (except the diabetic flavors; I want sugar in my dessert).  The fruity flavors taste light and vibrant while the ones that you would want to be dense are so velvety and rich (cheesecake; tiramisu; etc.).    The service is always friendly and eager to help.  The bathroom is spotless and even the outdoor seating is regularly checked on for cleaning.  The inside is sleek and modern.  My only gripes would be the price and the seeds in the blackberry cabernet flavor (it's still delicious; the seeds are distracting though).  It's not as cheap as DQ; but it is much better.  It is also much cheaper than Cold Stone but more satisfying.  It's impossible to leave this place without a smile.  Easily one of my favorite places in Tucson for any occasion. [REVIEW_2] Walked in for eyebrow threading and this was my first time experience... Samira was awesome. She had very good customer service and made me feel comfortable since I didn't know what to expect. I love my eyebrows now! They are super clean and it was a quick process. Thank you; Samira! [REVIEW_3] Thanks to the guys at Aladdin Graphics!!! I'm in California; I had an idea for a t-shirt; contacted them and they ran with it!!! Love the shirt; love the graphics; love the price; love the turn-around time!!! Everyone needs to use these guys for all their graphics!! They are officially my go-to guys from now on!!! [REVIEW_4] Growing up I lived right by Donut Drive-in.  We'd go every week after church and my sister and I would fight over the sprinkle donuts or the blueberry iced donuts.  Having moved back to St. Louis recently I forgot all about this place until one day my husband said ""Wow; that place looks old"" and I said ""We'll go there some weekend"" ---it took a few weeks but finally we were in the area so I got a dozen donuts for breakfast--HEAVEN!  I went in and picked out the donuts and it was like my entire youth flooding back--they haven't changed a bit which is comforting and also it makes sense--if it ain't broke; don't fix it!  My personal favorite is the french cruller with chocolate icing.  Tastes just like I remember although the custard with powdered sugar is a close second.    It was packed when I went inside but it took no time at all to get my box o' donuts.  Donut drive-in; don't ever change! [REVIEW_5] Thank god there is finally a decent coffee shop in Brandon and I don't have to settle for Starbucks any longer! I got a cold brew and my boyfriend got a frozen latte and it was under $10 after tip! I am so happy right now! [REVIEW_6] I have been here twice now; once in the sushi side and once in the hibachi side and both times the service and food were both amazing. The restaurant is plot in two so if you want a communal dinner there isn't a problem but if you want a more intimate one on one that can be done as well. The hibachi chef was well trained and knew all of the table show displays that are sometimes ignored. This has quickly become one of our favorite restaurants. [REVIEW_7] I don't often eat ice cream. But; when I do; I go here. The first time I went there last year a neighbor told me about the pumpkin. I tried it and it was the best ice cream/custard I had ever had. The staff are pleasant; courteous; and energetic.   On my trip there yesterday they were giving 10% of proceeds toward a dog rescue I'm involved with. I was impressed how comfortable the seating area is despite being on a busy road. Cute find here in tarpon springs. Check out the way the cone lights up at night with cute sprinkles. [REVIEW_8] This is def on my list of things I miss from Philly.  Cosi was my daily lunch spot for almost two years.  The signiture salad is amazing and their homemade bread is like nothing I've ever had.  I have tried almost everything on the menu and I have no complaints.  Sometimes they skimp on portions.  My first experience here was way back when it was named XOXO...anybody remember that?? The smores are perfect to share with a date or friends.  I always make sure to visit this comforting spot when back in Philly. [REVIEW_9] This is probably one of my favorite burgers I've had in a while. I'm not a terribly into burgers; so that's saying something. I got the 4 Cheese Garlic burger with a side of Mac and cheese; both delicious. The buns are definitely one of the best parts of the burger. My boyfriend got the 96 with a side of fries and loved it. The only thing I would say is that the patties are very thick. So; if you're a thin burger lover; this isn't for you. To finish; I got the ABC milkshake-- AMAZING. You can see my reaction in the photo. Overall; delicious and will be back again. [REVIEW_10] I was really hoping they would do something nice with this location; since it was my beloved old favorite spot to go to by myself. This is the old Filo's; I spent many nights there having a few drinks;  listening and dancing to great music by the Worship crew; then walking home.   We decided to check this place out one Friday night when a friend from out of town was visiting. It was the perfect atmosphere and food in the downstairs lounge area. The music the dj was playing was great and funky; yet not too loud; so that we could still hold a conversation. The food was spectacular; we had the Ceviche de Callos con Sandia (watermelon and scallop ceviche); I wasn't sure what to expect; it was not like the typical ceviche I have had before; but it was delicious. We also had the Queso Fundido; one with chorizo and the other with mushrooms. They were both devine!  They also have a reverse happy hour special in the lounge: Thursday - Saturday; 10pm-12am. We had some tasty margaritas (although not the best I have had; but good enough for the price); and we were feeling really nice by the time we left there; not too full; it was the perfect amount of food; and we still had some $ in our pocket!  I am definitely looking forward to going back to Xochitl. [REVIEW_11] Great bang for your buck; sushi was fresh and tasty; service was fast and kind. Definitely recommend [REVIEW_12] For almost $6 I got a combo platter which included: fried rice; sweet plantains; bourbon chicken and honey glazed chicken. You get to pick 2 sides and 2 meats for this price. They pile it up so you'll be sure to have left overs. They move very fast and try to pull people in to try samples when they aren't already serving customers.   This place is towards the back of the food court at the King Of Prussia mall. Not to be confused with Canton which is on the side. I usually take my food to go so that I could get back to work but you could also sit at the food court while you eat. [REVIEW_13] In my mind; a line out the door and sometimes filling out into the parking lot can never be a bad thing. This line situation has ALWAYS been the case; and I've been coming here since I was little girl when trips home from grandmas on I-70 meant taking a detour off the interstate to Gray Brothers Cafeteria. The lines may be long; but the place is huge; there are at least 3 very large rooms for dining; so don't worry about not being able to get a seat. The wait staff is friendly and will help carry your trays; bring you drink refills; etc.   Gray's certainly has the best tasting cafeteria food I've ever had. If I didn't go through the line looking at all the options myself; I would have thought someone's grandma or mom was back there serving up all of these home cooking favorites.   Obviously; the strawberry pie is iconic. It is good; a little sweet and syrupy for me. I like the sugar cream pie better personally.   And again; obviously; the fried chicken is also iconic. But that is finger licking good. Sometimes I opt for the chicken strips because I find them easier to eat - but all of their chicken is tasty. As are all of their meat and fish entrees I've tried.   Now for the sides. THE SIDES. I am a mac n cheese expert; let me tell you; and this is the BEST I'VE EVER HAD. Perfection. I wish I could get that for my entree.   The mashed potatoes and gravy are great; the green beans are great; the corn is great; heck; even the broccoli is great.  If I haven't convinced you to come here by now; I'm not sure if it will ever happen. But if your mouth is watering even a little bit after reading this review; I highly suggest making your way down to Mooresville; Indiana and heading to Gray's. It is worth the drive. Promise. [REVIEW_14] I don't know how I lucked out with having this taqueria in our neighborhood; but this is the best Mexican food you'll get in New Orleans.  We discovered Taqueria Guerrero after finding that burrito joint down the street was packed; had a line wrapping around the buidling (you know which one!).  After finding street parking near the mattress store; we plopped down and ordered the 3-taco plate (al pastor; mmmm) with beans and rice on the side and a burrito (barbocoa). I am a creature of habit and order the same tacos; but the bf has ventured out to get other dishes such as the fajita plate or the really spicy shrimp (camarones del diablo?). All very tasty.  The rest is history. It's embarrassing how often I suggest this place when we want to go out/get take out. [REVIEW_15] Anyone upset about this Company should know that the Owner tragically passed a few weeks ago. So - no; your calls will not be answered or returned. No - no one is controlling the emails; notices; etc. So if you continue to get notifications.... please; give the poor woman & her mourning family a break! She. Is. Dead! So save your crappy Yelp reviews for a business owner that can actually reply to you; fight back; make it up to you or just straight up has a Goddam heartbeat!  No need to tarnish anyone's reputation. [REVIEW_16] We've been coming here since I was a kid. The staff has watched me and now my kids grow up. They're personable and so nice. They're also very prompt with service. Yoli and frank are the absolute best! The food is amazing! I absolutely love their shredded beef burro and cheese crisp. I feel they have true authentic Mexican food. [REVIEW_17] Whisk is my favorite bakery in St. Louis. Their brownie in particular is fantastic; and I also dig their scones. Besides the great eats; the shop itself is also very charming and inviting. [REVIEW_18] I love this place and it's a shame that it's never beer busy when I come here. Their food is amazing and the owners and staff are so friendly and attentive! This is my go to bbq place in the area and will always be! The owners live above it and really care about the place. She chatted with us about their catering orders; so that's something you may want to consider if you're looking to cater something. They also do carry out and you can call in a carry out order. The daily specials are separate for dining in and carrying out however :) [REVIEW_19] Echoing other reviews; Birchtree was professional; responsive; delicious; and willing and happy to work with and contribute to our very particular vision for a localgreenDIY backyard wedding; which went off without a hitch.  I have zero misgivings about our experience with them; in fact they went well above and beyond; rescuing us from a bit of our own chaos; and I am happy to enthusiastically and glowingly recommend them! [REVIEW_20] Super Sunday Brunch   Such a great place for Sunday brunch. Split the cinnamon roll to start. So light and airy.   The Biscuits and Debris is a great Cajun twist on Eggs Benedict. The corn bread biscuits are deliciously addictive. The corn beef hash is unexpected light. Served with the perfect balance of sweet potato; braised cabbage and pickled green beans; it is the perfect breakfast bite.   Make a reservation. You won't be disappointed.",20
63,"[REVIEW_1] Becca is an awesome bartender. They have awesome happy hour specials including land shark. The food menu is somewhat limited but the service at the bar is great. We hope they can keep up the business and attract more locals. [REVIEW_2] Absolutely the worst meal I've had. The pizza was cold; the gyro meat looked like it was yesterday's offering; red potatoes were cold. $35 with two soft drinks. Upscale setting for awful food. Neighboring restaurants were full. Pita Jungle was empty on a Sunday night. [REVIEW_3] I love this place - their food is just cafe style but I always enjoy what I order. Lots of GF options which I don't necessarily need but my sister has Celiac's so it's awesome to have the choice! I love the coconut chai with coconut milk! This place also has a fun vibe to hang out or study. I would definitely recommend it and come here often! [REVIEW_4] AWESOME experience at this funky joint.   Server was super friendly and had the bartender make us off-menu drinks.  Mixologist was on point.  Food? HELL YES. Black bean burger (hold the bun) with chips and salsa-- divine! [REVIEW_5] Went back with my mom because I couldn't think of better competition at the time. She's much more keen to detail; specifically cleanliness. We took our food to go as she was jaw dropped at how unkept this place is. Also worth mentioning is that over my MANY drop ins for a quick coffee; the coffee counter has never once been fully stocked. Too many one star visits. Was great in comparison to the one up Easton road that closed. Now is just gross. [REVIEW_6] Burger Up is one of my favorite restaurants in Nashville.  While in college; I visited the one in 12th South pretty often.  Now that I live in Franklin; I go to the one in Cool Springs.  Same great food as 12 south but with more seating and less of a wait; yes please! The burgers are definitely one of my top favorite burgers. I get the one topped with pimento cheese; but I have tried a good bit of them.  All are amazing. The truffle fries are out of this world and their garlic aioli is absolutely delicious. Definitely one of my favorite meals in Nashville.  I even recommended it on my wedding website to guests from out of town to try. [REVIEW_7] 1. Bad service - all the waitresses were congregating by the cash register. not minding the place - food came out but we weren't asked what condiments we wanted nor were we provided any eating utensils. I guess it's a self service kinda place.  2. Bad food - old cold fries - unseasoned and overcooked burger. buns weren't even  toasted.  Don't go there for food. [REVIEW_8] First time here did the pastrami with extra me and the special sauce I'm a construction worker worker downtown Indianapolis it was simply a succulent I will definitely come back and bring some friends hey it's what we do check 1-2 [REVIEW_9] It was a Saturday night and market st in Philly was swarming with people. My friends and I checked 2 restaurants but they both had over an hour long waits. The wait at Anjou? Non existant. That should have been a red flag right there but we were starving and they had couscous on the menu; April's fave.  The menu wasn't cheap but the food sounded good. Marco and Karina ordered the ""Chilean Sea Bass w/ Tarot puree; heart of palm salad; atop a miso glaze [26]"". April ordered the ""Pan Seared Red Chile Norwegian Salmon; Sweet peas & couscous in a sun dried tomato; red pepper sauce [22]"" because again; she was seriously craving couscous. A fourth companion; Megan; ordered the ""Bi Bim Bap- A medley of vegetable & egg julienne; served with two traditional Korean sauces and a bowl of miso soup (available without beef) [16]."" I opted for the ""French Cut Chicken Breast; Wasabi gnocchi; wild mushrooms; & asparagus in a sweet garlic ginger sauce [22].""  All sounds delicious doesn't it? Yeah; we thought so too.  First problem. A chip in my glass that was sharp enough to cut a lip. I didn't get cut but I could have! Did I mention the plastic shard at Cheesecake?? The waitress apologized and gave me a fresh glass. Fine; no biggie.   Second problem. They ran out of gnocchi for my chicken and tried to push the mashed potatoes. Hey; I can make that at home for a dollar. No thanks. So they said they can do risotto. Fine; no biggie.  Third problem. A very; VERY long wait. For a restaurant that wasn't very busy; they sure like to take their time. Maybe they were trying to lure other unsuspecting people from the outside by pretending that they have a full happening place like the rest of them but my friends and I had no interest in being part of their marketing gimmick. We just wanted to be fed! The food had better be worth the wait....  Fourth problem. We finally received our entrees and I immediately recognized a problem. April; the poor innocent patron who had ordered the salmon because of the couscous received; before her; a plate looking very barren with a piece of salmon the size and shape of a sleeve of laffy taffys; 6 or 7 halves of asparagus; and NO COUSCOUS. BIG BIGGIE.  ""Where's her couscous?!"" I blurted out. That's when we noticed that nearly all our dishes were missing crucial elements from the menu.   The chilean sea bass was NOT served with mashed taro and hearts of palm salad. just a ring of MASHED POTATOES. Maybe I should have asked what ""french cut"" meant because now I know that it means ""slice a chicken breast as thin and flat as possible to try to cover the plate and keep down costs."" My wild mushrooms must've gone loco because they were nowhere on my plate. Maybe they were partying it up with my asparagus because they were also m.i.a. My risotto? Oh it was there all right; resting on my plate like a pale; sticky dome of something that resembled MASHED POTATOES! Since when is it okay to be able to scoop risotto with an ice cream scooper??   We were not happy campers. We went on a hunger strike. The host went back to the kitchen to find out what happened. He came back and informed us that ""they ran out of the couscous; and the mashed taro"" AND the gnocchi??? And the wild mushrooms??? What do you have back there; a 50 lb bag of instant MASHED POTATOES???   The rest is blur. I remember telling the host/waiter/customer service you can't just change an order without asking the patron if it's fine with them. He agreed and took care of the drinks that we had ordered. That much they did right. We still left a tip for the waitress because we felt horrible that she has to tell family and friends that she works there.   We left. Still hungry and livid. The waitress was outside crying and smoking a cigarette. Poor girl; I hope she moves on to a decent establishment like Hooters or Fudruckkers. I wish her well.  The 5 of us went down the street to Soho Pizza and scarfed scrumptious slices for 2.50 a piece. And when I ordered the mushroom and broccoli pizza; both mushrooms AND broccoli appeared on my slice. See; other people can do it; why can't Anjou?   Unless you want mashed potatoes; don't go here.   EDIT 1/19/10-  It has come to my attention that this dreadful place is now CLOSED. VICTORY!!!! [REVIEW_10] This is the worst bar experience I've ever had. I'll try to be brief. The three beers I tried to order last night were Sierra Nevada; Sweetwater 420; and Sam Adams Boston Lager. I drink these beers regularly draft and bottle and I am very familiar with them.   I ordered a Sierra Nevada and it came out flat and warm. My friend ordered a Yazoo Pale Ale and received a cloudy; orange colored; spicy smelling blue moon.   We sent them back and ordered Sweetwater 420 instead. They where also flat and warm.  The manager said their must be a problem with the draft system and offered us bottled beer instead. I ordered my standard choice of Sam Adams figuring it was a safe bet.  He returned  with a brown bottle with NO LABEL and quickly put it on the table without saying anything or apologizing and walked away. When I took a sip it was one of the same flat warm beers that came out of the draft; I couldn't quite identify it; but it wasn't Sam Adams. I realized that they had filled an empty bottle with Sam Adams. When I realized this bottle probably came out of the recycling I stood up an left. I'm still deciding if I'm going to call the Nashville Health Department on Monday.    I understand mistakes happen; and so I was polite and patient with them. In return; I've never been more disrespected by any restaurant or bar. Any other place would have thanked me for pointing out the issue and taken care of it. [REVIEW_11] I could make a jacks pizza taste better than their pizza with little effort.  We ordered two pizzas both horrible. Taste like cheap ingredients. Shouldn't be around long. [REVIEW_12] While they do have the hottest wings I've ever tried (i like everything hott hott hott); there's just too much grease for this stomach to handle..and just me..my stomach is made of iron.  My inlaws really enjoy the teri wings and eat it weekly.  Wish there was a way they could clear their arteries. [REVIEW_13] We were in St Pete on the weekend and decide to eat sushi. The worst sushi ever! Never go there again. All 3 or 4 king of sushi we ordered was terrible. [REVIEW_14] This is a great place to stay. I picked it because of the full kitchen; it was very helpful. We didn't spend as much money on food. Its very clean and cute! [REVIEW_15] Had the worst service here. I also work in the service industry and if I treated my customers like that I would feel ashamed! I went there my second time to get my hair colored with no hair cut. The girl who did my hair worked nice and fast which I like but when I was sitting under the heat (or whatever they call it; dryer?) she already took her next customer!?? I thought that she probably would work on her new customer a bit and then come back to me. But she never did!! She had someone else rinse and shampoo my hair; plus I had to ask if he could please at least dry it a bit so I won't leave the salon with soggy hair!!! Because you should know that they charge $34 for a blow dry style!! What? Unbelievable! Also; the two times I called to make an appointment and asked about their hair color prices I got a different quote each time and it was always a cheaper price than what they ended up charging me. Very unprofessional! [REVIEW_16] So I'm walking around looking for a place to eat and stop in here because it's not a chain type place; looks local. So I sit by the fish tank in the middle of a bunch of dirty tables; order some food from a menu the I had to get myself and has to many items on it for everything be good so I play it safe and order a beer and some fried food. I'm sitting at the table for 10mins Questioning why I'm not drinking my beer the bar was not busy and the bartender was not busy so I just walked out. [REVIEW_17] This place just could not be better. I love how they have a fully stocked new release section. You never have to worry if whether they have a new release or not. Great! I even have to admit that I don't mind when I have to pay late fees; because I love supporting this place. [REVIEW_18] Unless you have gray hair ; are over 45 and appear wealthy ; don't expect to get good service . My girlfriend and I sat there and witnessed our waitress cut up with many older couples in suits ; then would check on us every half hour to 40 minutes ; and didn't even check on our steaks and how they were prepared. The management never asked how our meal was ;(we witnessed them going table to table). VERY disappointed for spending $80; to get this poor of service . [REVIEW_19] So disappointing.....after living in the area for many years and ate there on many occasions I decided to stop for lunch. What I discovered that it is now fast food Mexican with no regaurd to your choice of toppings! Disgusting and not worth my money or time any longer..... So many better ""quick"" eats on the westside that probably would have been better - no more visits for me!  p.s. would've asked for a refund. But in this day and age didn't want to start any drama - [REVIEW_20] The only bad thing is that they don't have a good A/C system. The place is very cool; the food is excellent; and the beer is cheap too. I love coming here. Also; if you want a focused; buttoned up server who can answer your every question; don't go here. However; if you want to be served by an authentic; fun a bit spacey hipster; this is the spot!",8
64,"[REVIEW_1] Took my bigger dog there for grooming.  She came home with cuts in her ear and uneven fur in the front.  Who knows what else was done wrong.  Be warned... if something happens; you won't be told.  Totally unacceptable!!  Our poor dog has been tramatized of groomers since.  Def don't recommend. [REVIEW_2] This place is a joke. Always had been. Nickel and Dime you. I worked here for 10 years and was let go after the flood for no reason other than we don't need you anymore. Employees are nothing more than a number. [REVIEW_3] I expected to be bored. In fact me and the bf said good thing it's free or else we wouldn't go and probably will only stay an hour or so. But no; it was entertaining. A museum that is not boring! I liked the way it's set up for you to wander around. And ok the religious stuff was pretty boring but other than that it was good. Modern art was of course the most entertaining (and sometimes stupid; easy to see why it gets made fun of with some of the installations...just lol) There were so many things. The lights on the sides of the escalators; big entire wall murals. This room that you look in and it's all dark and foggy and there is a big grey square on the wall. You walk closer and then when you are right in front of it realize it's nothing; a cut out of the wall. That was probably a bad description. Go see for yourself then and write me a new one. And it was freezing out so I didn't even see any of the gardens which I've heard are marvelous. [REVIEW_4] I have had several bad experiences with the Montgomery county SPCA. I never thought to look up reviews until now.  The woman who I believe may have been previously employed there pretty much nailed it. A few years ago I went to one of the branches trying to rescue a severely underweight Neapolitan mastiff. They told me verbatim that they wouldnt cat or dog test her and they go by the typical behavior of the breed.  They said it was a liability if one of the dogs or cats in the meet got injured.  That being said; the dog wouldn't be adopted out to a home with cats.  They also told me under no circumstances would they adopt out a pit bull mix to a home with other animals  That left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. They weren't even willing to work with me to save this dog.  This weekend we stopped into a different branch and fell in love with one of the pit bull mixes they had there.  Her kennel card said she was good with kids and dogs as she previously lived with both. She had been turned in about 48 hour prior to our visit due to the fact that her family was moving and couldn't bring her.  We Inquired about her at the reception area where they were MORE than friendly and eager to give us as much information as possible.  They had said she actually hadnt  had a behavior evaluation by a manager yet and that they expected that to happen within the next few days.  They also made a comment that since she was an am staff mix she would require an application. I found that to be a bit weird and wondered to myself if either of the 2 small dogs that tried to rip my head off would require the same. So; unable to control my excitement; I called today to see if she had her behavior test and to set up a meet with my resident dog. The woman said she had failed her evaluation and was no longer up for adoption.  She wasn't allowed to give me any additional information. We were heart broken. I feel like maybe if we were informed of her issues we could decide if it was something we were able to rehabilitate. I didn't understand why she had a kennel card with her information if she hadnt even been evaluated. Again; the staff there were more than willing to help and very pleasant. Even the woman on the phone thanked me for calling in.  I love the SPCA and all they stand for; but I feel like the Montgomery county SPCA is less tolerant of any kind of behavior issues and are more willing to euthanize for space rather than work with a dog whos issues may be minor. [REVIEW_5] Love this place! I can't really speak for the food; as I am a vegetarian; but my husband loves it. They usually have 1 or 2 vegetarian friendly dishes and they are always great! The Mac n cheese is the best! And the drinks are amazing! I love a restaurant that sources it's good locally too :) [REVIEW_6] Had booked rooms a month in advance for a bachelor party. Waited for 2 hours and rooms were still not ready for check-in as the clock passed 5pm. Representative Leslie at the front desk was extremely rude; and was not willing to let us store our baggage while we waited for our room. Will never stay here again. [REVIEW_7] Warning: This location does not accept walk-ins. Signs are posted all over their front door saying ""absolutely no walk-ins"". My brother had a bad experience here getting fingerprints; employees were rude and bothered by having to do this service. [REVIEW_8] The food at this Qdoba was standard; but the service was horrible!  There were three people behind the counter and none of them wanted to help customers.  There was no one in line; and two of the three just kept standing at the sink talking to each other even after the third employee tried to call over the person working the first station.  We waited and waited; and a line of 3 other couples built up before the gentleman at the first station finally sighed loudly and walked to his station. [REVIEW_9] My husband and I eat at Molldeli about once a week; marking it one of our favorite lunch spots. We're kind of food snobs; and we find it to be a great experience all around. The restaurant was purchased by its current owner maybe 6 months ago; and it has certainly changed for the better. The menu is now chef inspired; with the specials truly highlighting the talented kitchen. But quite honestly; both my husband and I have our favorites on the regular menu; so we rarely even make it to the special board.   We all know the foundation of a great sandwich is delicious bread; and Molldelli has certainly figured that out... both the regular hoagie roll and the wheat roll are fantastic. My husband's favorite sandwich is the hot salami (but do be warned... it is super spicy); and I adore the chicken club. But lately we've both been fixated on the buffalo chicken salad. It's so good! You know when you order a salad and the ratio of lettuce to toppings is off? That's very much not the case with this salad - you have plenty of toppings from start to finish. The only change we make to it is having the chicken served hot (on the menu; it's cold). It's just a personal preference; but for us; it makes it just slightly better.   No matter what you order at Molldeli; you will have a great food experience. They appeal to all customers; having both the traditional and more daring menu items available. I agree with the sign - best sandwiches; off The Hill! [REVIEW_10] Awful. Awful. Awful.  The receptionist barely looks up when you enter.  The ""massage therapist"" (quotes because I doubt she even went to school) Lina  had long nails and scratched my neck; both painful and still present the day after. She wasn't fluid in her motions whatsoever. She barely listened to a word of request. I said ""I don't want to do anything else; I'd like to just work on my neck and my left shoulder."" Next thing I know she's at my feet and I had to redirect her several times. Even then; her skill was completely lacking and I left feeling worse than I did going in. She said ""okay you feel good"" and walked out. No! I felt terrible and my scratches hurt. She's abrupt; doesn't listen; and actually causes injury.   Melissa the person who did the facial was WONDERFUL and I was really thinking that the place was looking up after seeing her. Excellent; excellent.   The woman who did my nails. I don't remember her name; but she was also harsh and abrupt. She asked where my friend and I worked and when we told her she proceeded for the ENTIRE duration of our pedicures to tell us how much she despises our place of employment and the job that we do. Despite our frequent attempts to redirect the conversation and apologize and explain to her why her small cut on her finger was not seen in the Emergency Department before a major trauma; she continued to bash our work. It was miserable.   Miserable place; miserable people.   Don't waste your time; there are so many better places with better people and better quality service for half the price!!! [REVIEW_11] When I ordered my pizza for me and my friends ; he pizza was so small and this delivery girl took forever and she was rude and didn't want to give me my change back and she said she thought I gave her a tip no ! And she didn't even give me the right change and it was all coins ! This place sucks ! DONT EAT HERE !!!!!! [REVIEW_12] This store is TERRIBLE.  I will only run in for one or two things if I absolutely have to.  I love WalMart but this one - no matter when you go (I've even been at 5am) you will wait FOREVER and 9 out of 10 times the clerk won't talk to you... at all.  I've gotten a significant amount of items that were out dated; however they do have good prices overall and there is good parking. Oh -the ATM NEVER works too. [REVIEW_13] Waked in and ordered a meal. Simple; 1 egg; regular hashbrowns; order of bacon. 30 minutes later I get just my bacon. And now I'm still waiting. The worst staff. [REVIEW_14] DO NOT shop there! Driver decided to drive off with out fridge- after 4 hours on the phone resolution was a 10% coupon and delivery... In 4 days!! Worst experience ever! Unprofessional and rude! Would never shop there again. Beware!! [REVIEW_15] Absolutely terrible customer service. I am for sure ranting here... Asked for a happy hour menu on one of my visits. The lady bartender said it was happy hour and she would get me a menu. Ordered fried pickles and a beer from the menu. Went to pay my bill an hour later and the dude with the long beard behind the bar rung me up. My bill was for normal price (and overpriced). He said the order was put it at 3:59 it looked like. He was a total jerk about it with no forgiveness after I told him I was led to believe it was happy hour. Needless to say there was no tip!  I went back; a few days later; shockingly. Ordered a cocktail. A simple old fashioned with brandy. I asked for soco and they didn't have it. So i asked for brandy. Cocktail was good. Get the bill later ... $12 cocktail. For real! It wasn't even an 8oz cocktail. More like a 4oz! And there was a $4 bogus charge on there which i was unaware about when ordering and that long bearded guy again behind the bar told me what it was for after the fact (something to do with adding a higher liquor quantity). I wouldn't have wanted that in the first place!! So again; no forgiveness and forced to pay that bill. Again; zero tip.   otherwise; you can get takeout beer here and the outdoor couches are ok. But customer service really blows!!! they're so slow and unforgiving and confusing ! I hope that long bearded guy is not a manager. Very pathetic [REVIEW_16] Inattentive and confused waiters could have been either inexperienced or under staffed. Bring SPF 45 sunblock in case you seated near the neon sign. Food was par. Bring crayons; tables are covered in paper. Bottom line: tonight was my first and last experience at st. Tropez. [REVIEW_17] Unbelievable freshness; flavor; variety of textures in their bahn mi! They are so ridiculously good that we always order extra for the next day and they taste just as good then. The pho is super good but traditional so be prepared for surprise meats. I think it would be hard to find anything on their menu that is not exceptional. Very very favorite bahn mi place. [REVIEW_18] Awful. We switched years ago to AT&T because of Charter's terrible service; surprise charges; crappy equipment and AWFUL; AWFUL; AWFUL customer service. A salesman showed up at our door the other day saying that things were better and customer service and the company had an overhaul. He promised that the Internet would be faster and better than the one we were using; saying that each device would be connected to 100mb; not every device sharing that 100mb; our cable would be the exact same and we'd have a land line on top of it all for the same price that we were paying with AT&T. Absolute crap! We had the most basic of basic channels and the Internet was MUCH slower than AT&T. We were less than 24 hours in with Charter and attempted to get things corrected. No one would work with us and offered to charge us more to have the same channels we had before. The salesman left his cell number for us to contact him should there be any problem whatsoever and he would correct it immediately. When we attempted to contact the salesman he didn't answer the first time; and anytime after that it went straight to voicemail. Back to AT&T it is. [REVIEW_19] Worst customer service I have encountered here... Was lied to not once but 3 times about a taxi being ""on the way"" 2 hours later after I'm home I get a call saying the taxi is outside. Comical. Never calling again. [REVIEW_20] So delicious; top notch food; service; and it's super cute inside. The owner Brad is really friendly helpful with the menu and just overall welcoming and makes you feel like a longtime friend",5
65,"[REVIEW_1] I had a Groupon for a Shellac manicure; Pedicure and Paraffin hand treatment. I didn't have too much of a problem getting an appointment over the phone though Brenda was very short with me.  Once I got there for my appointment with Brenda (which had been scheduled about 2 weeks in advanced) she was overbooked and asked me to come back later. I was unable to so she told me to come the next day. The next day I came back and was able to redeem my Groupon. It was a nice little shop but I did not see any sterilization of the nail tools. she carried them around in a coffee mug and there was nail dust everywhere;  She made personal calls during my pedicure and was very condescending when she spoke to me about my nails.  She also uses Bath and Body works lotion witch isn't a big deal but then she sprayed my legs with the body spray witch I thought was very strange and did not smell the greatest.  My shellac bubbled and didn't look the greatest and my nails were uneven. I also never got my Paraffin hand treatment because one of her ""usual"" customers came in and she was too busy talking to her to finish mine and I was very rushed at the very end.  She spent more time talking to others in the shop and on the phone than with me and was very condescending when she did speak to me. I will not be going there again and I will not be recommending this establishment to any of my peers. [REVIEW_2] Went to this store to get a passport sent to England A.S.A.P (which weighs next to nothing); they told me it would be $110 for 4 day delivery with no guarantee that it would arrive by then. I went to Fed Ex who told me they could do it for $57 with a 2 day guarantee. Shop around before using UPS!!! [REVIEW_3] Poor service from the door. Stood at the door for 15 mins; walked in when it was not super busy it was Thursday at 12pm. I'm pregnant and there is no more seating area; which I think was a stupid decision when they reopen so they can flip more tables. Was ignored by 2 staff members who seating 3 people before me. Food was cold the times I come in there. The French toast is horrible. They just good making basic eggs that doesn't take much flavor or time. I get the actual egg not the ready made batter. Over fried meats. Burnt has Browns. Save your money & go to a mom & pop local diner to get more for your money. [REVIEW_4] I would shut this location down. Every drive threw order is 5 min or longer. Who manages this place? I'm done trying to eat there. [REVIEW_5] Awesome Peruvian food. I have only been there twice but I really enjoyed their tasteful plates. Bistec a la Chorrillana is a must have. [REVIEW_6] I dropped off a suit that I needed cleaned last week and was told to pick it up on Friday. When I came in I was told it wasn't ready yet and I could pick it up on Saturday. I come back on Saturday to find them closed for 3 days. Now I have to go buy a new suit for a funeral today. This is very unacceptable [REVIEW_7] Been to MOD pizza once and the experience was something to remember. We went around lunch time and the service was great. I love how you can choose what toppings you want and the good guys at MOD pizza bake to order. Defiantly will be returning in the near future to MOD Pizza! [REVIEW_8] I love Vedge and was really looking forward to Wiz Kid for vegan take-out in my neighborhood. Huge disappointment!  Very few healthy options! (Note: see all the reviews about the fries;). It may be tasty but I can't say because; as a healthy vegetarian; there was nothing appealing for me to order. I stopped in on several different occasions in the hope of finding some additional menu options; but no luck at all. Really too bad! [REVIEW_9] Recently went to Make Up For Ever at KOP. Initially had a great experience and bought $75 worth of products. After trying them for 5 days I didn't really like them. I went to return and was told I couldn't because they were opened. Thankfully they let me exchange but I ended up having to shove more money out! Then they stamped a big FINAL SALE on my new receipt. Overall; still not in love with the products and definitely won't be buying from there again.  The Sephora in KOP sells the same Make Up For Ever products and their return policy is unopened or gently used can be returned; so I'll just keep shopping there. [REVIEW_10] I was on the guest list tonight as my friend from high school was DJing; however; when I got to the front of the line I was unfortunately shoved through the front door before I could show my ID and verify my guest list status. After I was shoved through I tried to explain to the bouncer what had happened so I could properly verify that I was actually on the list. This bouncer then accused me of just trying to sneak in for free without paying even though I went back to him once I was inside. He then proceeded to belittle me and completely disregard the fact that I was allowed to be there. This ended in me being denied total entry; despite the fact that I was on the list; and I will never come here due to how I was treated by this bouncer. [REVIEW_11] Spent way too much money to get actually spoiled food delivered to us. Ordered a huge order; over 50% of it was incorrect. Will never return to this location. [REVIEW_12] This service does not deliver. We paid for round trip service in advance from the airport to our hotel and from the hotel back to the airport 4 days later.  The limo did not show up as promised on the return trip.  After waiting 20 minutes; we took a taxi to avoid missing our flight.  After returning home we called to get a refund for the service back to the airport.  We were rudely accused of not waiting for the limo (despite needing to catch a flight).  She said she would have to talk to the manager.  We never heard back form them and have filed a complaint with the credit card company to acquire the refund.  DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE! [REVIEW_13] We stayed at the Opal across the street and thought to give this a try.  I had the coconut shrimp as an appetizer - they were very good.  Wife had a chicken sandwich which she liked.  I ordered shrimp tacos which were TO DIE for.  We ended up getting desert - key lime pie and chocolate strawberry cheesecake.  My wife loved hers.  I enjoyed lunch here so much we came back for dinner and got the same thing; couldn't recommend it more. Everyone else got shrimp which everyone loved.  Good prices; highly recommend this place.  It's new too which is nice. [REVIEW_14] Horrible disgusting not sure how they are even open. Food tasted old and was served cold and had zero taste. [REVIEW_15] My boyfriend and I arrived at Don Pablo's at 5:45 on Saturday night. We were told the wait was 30 minutes- awesome. After 45 minutes passed; we checked in with the hostess again. "" Oh; you had a faulty buzzer"". No apology; no coming to find us; nothing. The manager took us to our table; again no apology- just explained that this happens a lot.  After being seated; our server came 15 minutes later for our drink order. No introduction; just ""What do you want to drink."" After ordering a margarita and beer; we waited another 10 minutes for our drinks to arrive.  I regret our appetizer of flauetas or whatever they are called. Frozen taquitos that were rock hard when they arrived at my table. After the appetizer; it took 35 minutes for our entrees to reach the table. My boyfriends was cold and mine was incorrect. After already being in this restaurant for over 2 hours; we had enough. The waiter saw we were frustrated and took one meal off the bill. Terrible service; terrible food; terrible management. First and last visit for us! [REVIEW_16] Awful.  Ordered online via  From You Flowers.  What I paid for was a premium bouquet which should have had a minimum of 8 lavender roses in it but what they delivered had just four pink ones and a whole bunch of greenery.  The vase was not what I ordered either - they substituted something very different.  This was a birthday bouquet for a friend who just found out about having breast cancer and I really wanted to cheer her up with a nice bouquet. This shop couldn't be more disappointing. [REVIEW_17] Literally the most racist restaurant I have ever been into in my life. The manager was as unprofessional as the teenagers running the register. I literally waited for 5 minutes to be called to a register for my order with no one else on any lines. Not sure if it was my skin tone but wow I had another experience that made my suspicions facts after paying a second order and being passed over by 3 other customers who ordered after me. I only ordered a kids nuggets. Terrible everything [REVIEW_18] An amazingly beautiful place with so much to do! The outdoor art is awesome; the walk around is refreshing; the flowers smell wonderful and are a beautiful sanctuary for the butterflies the flutter about. The swings that are built on the fallen tree are awesome and provide the perfect pitstop while walking along 100 Acres. I was most happy about finding Funky Bones!   When we finally got inside the Museum (and no; we did not finish all of 100 Acres; outside) I was thankful for the cool blast of air conditioning. The walk around the second floor was amazing. I'm not much into art; but there was something about the IMA makes it so interesting. Maybe it's because admission to the Gallery and the outside exhibits is FREE! The only thing you would have to pay for is admission to the special visiting exhibits; that is if you wanted to see them.  I will definitely be going back again; this time i'll be wearing comfortable outside-in-the-summer walking gear; not skinny jeans and flip flops. [REVIEW_19] As 45 put it best...  this place is a ****hole.   To the people in charge of the entire brand Steak and Shake:  take note of how Freddy's operates. Ditch the worthless waiters who understandably are as motivated to return to the table as I am the proctologist..   it's flipping 3.99 meals and half the customers are kids. Of course you won't make crap for tips.   Put up a coke freestyle machine and have people place and order up front. I'll get my own refills and napkins. Faster mind you and with pleasure.   PS.  It's not normal to had a 4 year old a fully loaded plate of food. [REVIEW_20] Locations at both Ina Rd and Oracle Rd have equipment that is out dated and or needs repair.  If in need of repairs the average time to complete the repairs is at least 3-4 weeks.",4
66,"[REVIEW_1] Ewww!!! I used to go to this location all the time; the staff was always friendly and I could count on it being good. There was also usually always an employee cleaning. However; after the experience I had today; I certainly won't be returning. The place was filthy. Food all over the window in front of where you order; food all over the floor; and food on almost every single table. I bit into my taco and thought it tasted weird; then looked and discovered that the chicken was dark meat with skin on it. Wtf happened to this place? I'm really disappointed. Please fix this store; no place where food is eaten should be this disgusting. [REVIEW_2] I had a scheduled appointment no one came to greet me as I pulled up which was fine as I was. 15 minutes early.  I waited a total of 50 minutes still not one service representative met with me.  I had made this appointment a week and half prior.  A service tech came by and asked that I move my car to make room for others this is waiting 1 hour 37 minutes to get waited on .  I said sure and just left as he had no idea when someone would meet with me.  The last thing I get is a voicemail saying I missed my appointment if I wanted to reschedule.  No wonder this dealership has so low ratings.  I will call Honda customer service and voice my concerns next week. [REVIEW_3] We are in the middle of a coast to coast road trip; and spent a long day in St. Louis with 3 small kids; so I was grateful to find this place on Yelp.  It was near our hotel; and was a perfect mix of tasty food and kid-friendly in a grown-up environment. Saw lots of couples on dates as well.   The full-sized power salad was huge and tasty; kids' chicken strips were made from real white meat chicken (and were delicious); and the burgers were amazing. Fries and sides were creative. Service was prompt; friendly; and very welcome after a hot; exhausting day. Ice cream was home-made and creamy.   Perfect! [REVIEW_4] Only giving one star because I'm required to give A star in order to leave a review.   First; rude employees. We were never greeted; never acknowledged; while multiple employees came to the station in front of us and then walked away. No one even looked up at us. As we were about to walk out; someone finally stood there and looked at us. Not sure if she actually said anything; but we gave her our order anyway.   Food quality was BAD! The pinto beans were cold. The brisket was not warm; but I wouldn't call them quite cold. I looked for their health score but didn't see it posted anywhere. Maybe the lack of one should have been a sign.  Yeah; we won't be back. Like ever. With so many other restaurants in this shopping center; there are too many good choice to settle for food and service this bad. Save yourself the trouble and go next door to Panera; or Fulins; or Longhorn. Heck; even go buy you a candy bar from Target before choosing to eat here. You'll be glad you did. [REVIEW_5] The worst service I've had at a restaurant in years. Went on a Sunday for lunch and our waitress took forever at every step in the process; and acted like she was doing us a favor at all times. Never smiled or treated us with basic human dignity. The final straw was when she finally brought our food; I was left to stare at it while it got cold for almost 10 minutes because she didn't bring any silverware. I had to ask three different waitstaff for silverware before I finally got it. And all of this for pretty mediocre; way overpriced food. Nashville has SO MANY good restaurants (particularly burger places) that there's no reason to eat here. [REVIEW_6] This place has gone downhill in a hurry.  When it first opened; the donuts were actually good and had creative toppings.  Now they have creative topping but the actual donuts don't taste fresh.  They have opened up a few locations and now the quality at the original location isn't there. [REVIEW_7] In my mind; a line out the door and sometimes filling out into the parking lot can never be a bad thing. This line situation has ALWAYS been the case; and I've been coming here since I was little girl when trips home from grandmas on I-70 meant taking a detour off the interstate to Gray Brothers Cafeteria. The lines may be long; but the place is huge; there are at least 3 very large rooms for dining; so don't worry about not being able to get a seat. The wait staff is friendly and will help carry your trays; bring you drink refills; etc.   Gray's certainly has the best tasting cafeteria food I've ever had. If I didn't go through the line looking at all the options myself; I would have thought someone's grandma or mom was back there serving up all of these home cooking favorites.   Obviously; the strawberry pie is iconic. It is good; a little sweet and syrupy for me. I like the sugar cream pie better personally.   And again; obviously; the fried chicken is also iconic. But that is finger licking good. Sometimes I opt for the chicken strips because I find them easier to eat - but all of their chicken is tasty. As are all of their meat and fish entrees I've tried.   Now for the sides. THE SIDES. I am a mac n cheese expert; let me tell you; and this is the BEST I'VE EVER HAD. Perfection. I wish I could get that for my entree.   The mashed potatoes and gravy are great; the green beans are great; the corn is great; heck; even the broccoli is great.  If I haven't convinced you to come here by now; I'm not sure if it will ever happen. But if your mouth is watering even a little bit after reading this review; I highly suggest making your way down to Mooresville; Indiana and heading to Gray's. It is worth the drive. Promise. [REVIEW_8] After two years in California I still dream of Yats.  Every time I come into town; this is one of my must-stop restaurants.  If you like cajun / creole served up in big portions for not a lot of money; Yats is where it's at. [REVIEW_9] Truly a trash company..prices rise every year due to gas prices..even though gas was cheaper than previous year. Been using for 8 years and I am ""Done""..believe the reviews...environmental(gas) fee is now over $120/year on top of the $450/ for residential trash pick up...Ripoff!!..i hope we have another option in Oracle Az. [REVIEW_10] I was looking for a new salon and this one was recommended to me by a friend. I made an appointment for just a haircut to start. Amanda was my stylist and she was really great. She was knowledgeable; checked in as she worked to make sure I liked it; and very friendly! Overall; I will definitely be returning and probably booking color services as well because I had such a positive experience. [REVIEW_11] I ordered general tso chicken. Nothing but breaking. My niece ordered $78 in food to be delivered. They forgot 4 egg rolls. She called to complain. They yelled at her and would not bring her the egg rolls or refun her money. Big rip off  I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN [REVIEW_12] Great place if you are a carnivore...and if you're not try the sides!  I've had everything off of this menu and it's all delicious.  Pulled pork; BBQ chicken sandwich..rack of ribs; corn salad; mac and cheese; baked beans...just writing this is making me hungry.  It's so awesome to have something this good and this authentic in the hood.  NOT expensive either.  Informal but cozy. [REVIEW_13] Three out of four times I came for servicing (oil change; tire replacement; and inspection) I had an early morning appointment and was told they probably couldn't get the job done....it got done; but took several hours. Today; I went in for oil change (no appointment) ready to drop my car off for the day and was told (after waiting in line for 25 min) that there were no available appointments for 3 days. This location clearly can't handle basic servicing; so they surly won't  have to worry about my car anymore. [REVIEW_14] WORST location  out there. I eat Chipotle 4+ times a week; and every time I go to this location I have a terrible experience.  Today; my burrito (with almost no meat put in) tortilla fell apart while trying to wrap it. He then tried to rewrap it and failed.  It came apart again on the third try... as well as the fourth.  When the fifth tortilla broke in three different spots; he still wrapped and gave it to me.  Also; have the ingredients were stuck to the previous tortilla tries.  Like I said; I eat Chipotle 4-5 times a week; but I'll be going to Qdoba after this. [REVIEW_15] I'm giving Village Whiskey five stars because you know what?  It's a damn good burger.  And they don't mess around with anything else.  It's my center city roadside diner.  Stop in for a quick lunch at the bar - chew your burger; read the paper; move on. [REVIEW_16] Fun atmosphere;  deep dish pizza was worth the wait.   Our server was very friendly and attentive.  Good family place for a meal. [REVIEW_17] Alden and his two partners; Arolyn and Chuggy; have added a new wonderful ice cream store on the SE corner of Campbell & Speedway here in Tucson. Alden and wife MA are old hands at making and serving ice cream s they have been doing this for 20 some years at heir store in Booth Bay Harbor; Maine. They make their own ice cream; and have created all the flavors. [REVIEW_18] Being from Cincinnati we know ipas and urban south has the best ones we've found in Nola. Brewery is casual and low key. [REVIEW_19] We would have loved to try this restaurant but unfortunately we were told they had stopped serving food when we got there (we got there shortly before 10pm). The Eldorado website clearly stated that they served lunch and dinner until close. I was very unimpressed. We did not even have a chance to try their beer as we had been driving for 5 hours and needed food first. [REVIEW_20] I used to think this place was amazing. During office hours the place is fantastic but grabbing food during a night out? Don't even do it . All the workers assume every patron who comes at night is a drunk. So asking simple questions is automatically a reason to yell and refuse service. Customer Service is absolutely horrible. I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN. there patties have shrunk and price has remained the same. This place has definitely taken a dive from what it used to be.",9
67,"[REVIEW_1] Amazing gluten free Acai bowl. I just got almonds instead of the granola. What an amazing concept for a restaurant. I highly recommend going here - very healthy; very fresh and you can tell they are proud of what they serve. Very unique and worth a trip.  www.glutenfreechickie.com [REVIEW_2] Sorry we cannot rate NO STARS...made reservation 24 hrs in advance with Open Table app...arrived for dinner 15 minutes early only to find restaurant was ""closed for private party""...staff member who was not at all sympathetic told has they tried to call everyone that morning...had no missed calls on phone or message from Open Table app...never again Ole Red...Big Blake really disappointed us. [REVIEW_3] So we've been here a couple times; I decided to review it this time because it really is a wonderful place to come! They have their own version of city wide specials for $5; which is amazing paired with their cheese board; as strange as that may seem. We originally came here for the crawfish mac & cheese which ended up being the side highlight; it didn't really have a savory crawfish taste in every bite; but either way we still love this place!! [REVIEW_4] P-a-R guys did a great job with our event!  All throughout the process; from planning to execution; they were attentive; helpful; flexible and focused on the guests.  Great job! [REVIEW_5] Just had lunch with family here today. Awful service. First; steaks were not cooked as we had asked. Second; they ran out of our sides and instead of asking us before they brought the food out if we would like to substitute or wait for it to come out with our meal. They just brought out our meal and said it'd be 15 minutes for the rest. Asked for manager; manager trivialized our concern. Tried to explain their communication process as if it wasn't their fault. When I told her that this should have been communicated to us first; she gave up and stated flatly what we wanted her to do. I don't know? Why don't you tell me what you're going to do. Don't expect your customer to handle your problem. As a manager; take initiative and fix the problem. After that; we had a free appetizer on our phone. Waitress took phone instead of writing it down. (Seriously people; this is a liability on your end if the phone breaks or there is privacy issues.) And failed to use it. So charged another person the appetizer in an attempt to hide the fact. Seriously; stay away from this one. Usually have a good time at other Texas Roadhouses. Never going back to this one. [REVIEW_6] I enjoyed my lunch at Luke's. The service was superb and the food was delicious. We could taste the love and thought process that the chef created to inspire our palate of the quality of food that Luke's is awarded in New Orleans and in the USA. [REVIEW_7] Never thought I could sit down at a place like this do work and homework and enjoy a coffee. But this place is amazing. Great to do business and school assignments and enjoy it. Service is great; always seems like they are in a great mood. Still haven't tried the salads but have had every sandwich and they are delicious. [REVIEW_8] I don't live in the area; but I found this place while working. It is absolutely incredible! The atmosphere is very relaxing and the worker I had; Ms Z; was pretty new but her hands were like magic! I felt totally refreshed after my session. I would go there every week if I did not live so far away. Everyone should be so lucky to find this place! [REVIEW_9] Went for lunch and the food on the buffet was fantastic! The onion chutney was amazing! [REVIEW_10] I love coming here! All of the Chiropractors are knowledgeable; quick; and very kind! They gave me a key fob to scan in when I come in. I love it because they have an automated system that directs me to the table. The reception staff is very helpful and wonderful! I recommend this place to anybody looking for a great chiropractic family! They have a massage chair that you can sit in while you wait. They always have treats while you visit. They work with you on payment plans if you can't afford a lump sum. [REVIEW_11] Great; beautiful spot to do wine tasting. I loved all the wines I tried; great prices as well as service. I had a good [REVIEW_12] I went here for the first time on Friday with my wife and kids. From start to finish the service was quick and friendly. The food was the best Italian food I have had in a while. They started us out with delicious bread. We ordered the spicy chicken flat bread. The bread was very spicy but definitely good. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan and my wife ordered the monte rosena chicken dish with mashed potatoes instead of pasta. Most definitely the creamiest mashed potatoes I ever tasted. My egg plant parm was perfect. I will definitely go back to this restaurant again. [REVIEW_13] Called service 5:15 pm Wed and they had appt window narrowed to between 9 and 10 am the next day.  Andy Y  arrived punctually; made diagnosis inside of 10 minutes and provided reasonable options for blocked drain pan n valve leading to recurring locked freezer drawer on 7 yo Samsung reefer.  Got the drawer to open; removed ice; stripped unit down front n back; cleaned dual freezer compartment drain tubes showing both to me; filled with very gnarly; moldy scummy stuff.  I paid the $89 minimum diagnostic fee plus another $54 or so as Andy's work came to $143 which the minimum fee was credited toward.  I could have googled more self repair vids; spent thrice the time making a mess and twice the $$$ for Andy or others to fix my inevitable misadventure.  So naturally I was very happy to get my freezer back in less than 24 hours for $143.  Your mileage may vary! [REVIEW_14] Amazing place for good fun. Got engaged last night and brought my now fiance with me to the n crowd. Asked if they could do a little shout out for her. Not only did they do a shout out they did a skit renacting her entire day. Was hilarious and really made the night extra special. Highly recommend the N Crowd to anyone who likes to laugh and have fun. A++++++ [REVIEW_15] I moved from Chicago to Philadelphia over a year ago.  Everybody here raves about the restaurants; but I have yet to find many that deserve five stars; or even four.  This is the best restaurant I have eaten in in Philadelphia.    Tahini and bread  arrived at the table; and I thought; hum; plain but I'm hungry.  They must put crack in that Tahini.  I wanted to lap it out of the bowl like an uncouth dog.  The bread is excellent too.  I love a menu with many organic meat choices.  How often can you order an organic beef shishkabob?  It was superb.  The meat done perfectly; the onions nearly caramelized but not quite so they still had some substantive crunch.  The purslane salad tasted like I was eating a plant in the middle of a garden.  It is not often that I dream about a salad but I do dream about this one  My husband had a chicken dish with black eyed peas and green peas and fantastic rice.  I won't begin to describe the flavoring; it is beyond my culinary vocabulary.  We asked what spices they use; and in addition to traditional zatar; they use their own blend of spices.  I don't even need to know what is in it just so long as we can keep coming back and ordering it again and again.  I was so full but ate dessert none the less; which I usually don't do.  But when a diner is this good; I had a feeling the desserts would be too and I just needed to find out.  Pistachio creme brulee.  It could have come out over the top; but no indeed.  It was pure pistachio heaven in s super light yet rich custard.  Heaven. Heaven.  Our service was superb.  The squeezed us into a last minute Friday night reservation with the caveat that we would need to get through our dinner in an hour and 15 minutes in order to accommodate a reservation made prior to us.  Given the time constraints they never made us feel rushed and timed the meal perfectly.  Then my husband left to go to the restroom; the waiter picked up his napkin and refolded it nicely on the table.  Do I care about the napkin placement in the middle of a meal?  Not really; but it is a sign that the waitstaff is incredibly attentive and extremely well trained.    My eating out plan for Philly might just be to skip eating most everywhere most of the time so I can frequent this expensive; though appropriately priced restaurant.  Kudos to the chef. [REVIEW_16] Great restaurant. Very cool and classy decor; a super nice waitress; and excellently prepared dishes.   Food: The prix fixe menu prices were very reasonable with good choices. I especially liked the shrimp and goat cheese crepes - outrageously good. I also liked the pork chops - big; thick; fatty; and tasty. The bread pudding was delicious too.   Service: super attentive and polite and personable waitress.   Ambiance: very cool place; beautiful decor; historic building.   Would definitely return. [REVIEW_17] Had salmon burger that was delicious. Server Emily was great. Saturday morning early without much of a crowd. Truffle fries really good. [REVIEW_18] This place is phenomenal. The food is ON point!! The chefs are total artists and it's beautiful to watch. Had the ahi poke and spicy chicken ramen. Can't wait to go back!!! [REVIEW_19] Let me be frank and say I am a universal Schlafly fan. I like the Schlafly family; their products; each restaurant; and their presence in the St. Louis community. This review is based on several experiences.   Bottleworks: Great beer and a nice atmosphere. You can bring your entire family; a group to watch the game or have a quiet date night spot. Food is of great quality and nice quantity.   Waitstaff are some of the best in the City. I have never ever been disappointed with a server; manager; buser or host. One time a buser overheard my dad talking about a particular beer that was no longer on tap for the season. My dad was bummed because he had just discovered it and wasn't able to find it anymore. 15 minutes later the young man dropped off a mini-pint at our table and told us he had looked and found a tiny reserve in the back. Super impressive and wayyy beyond the call of duty. [REVIEW_20] We absolutely love Club 21. My husband and I have been coming for dinner for over 40 years. The food is fabulous. We love the wait staff. The owner is the best. This is the best Mexican food in Tucson.",18
68,"[REVIEW_1] This place was terrible.  We had a muffin out of the case that you could have used to play hockey with.  I had the breakfast nachos and they used a microwave to cook a fake egg. How hard is it to cook a real egg?  Do not waste your money.  I have had better food on a flight in China.  Coffee and smoothly were adequate. [REVIEW_2] There's just something different about the seafood here. Located a short cab ride from Downtown Philly; is DiNardo's. A non-descript; red brick building with a wooden sign swaying in the breeze points to the front entrance of this establishment. The huge crab on their sign hints that maybe you should try the crab. The Blue Claw crabs are flown in everyday from the Gulf Coast. Unlike their cousins in the Chesapeake; these Gulf Coast crabs are ""free swimmers""; which means bigger crabs and more meat.  Let's look at their raw bar. Clams on the Half Shell are half dozen freshly shucked ice-cold beauties served atop ice accompanied by cocktail sauce and lemon. These clams are sweet with a scent of the sea.  These are the best clams on the half shell I have ever had. The cocktail sauce is the best cocktail sauce I've ever had; sweet with just the right amount of horseradish. Thumbs up with 5 stars! [REVIEW_3] I've been here many times and I always come back. Great location! The service however is touch and go. It's also noteworthy that I didn't see any African American servers or bartenders. The food is good; but not great; and I haven't seen a mouse the last couple times I've been. Enjoy! [REVIEW_4] I don't get gel nails often; but I can tell when someone takes the time to do a job well and they truly did a wonderful job. Will definitely go back. [REVIEW_5] Always love going to Whirled Peace! They have a nice rotation of 10-12 flavors and all the fixins. I go there about once a week and have been doing so for months (even in the cold). Great place to get some reasonably priced frozen yogurt! [REVIEW_6] Came to visit my daughter and we had dinner tonight.  I had been here before but my husband had not. We were looking at reviews and someone mentioned they loved their Bucatini Ronaldo so I decided to give it a try.  Waiter stated that the pasta for this dish is homemade (like tubed noodles) with shrimp; artichokes and roasted eggplant in a red sauce. While everything was delicious; I thought this dish was fantastic as it was unusual. It had all my favorite ingredients.  Our waiter Kubec was very attentive and service was great.  Overall......5 star worthy!  In fact my daughter is going back next weekend with 6 friends! [REVIEW_7] Probably my least favorite thing I did in New Orleans. It was a boring boat tour with a guide that had the strangest accent. It felt like he was slurring through the entire two hour tour. Not very interesting insights either and it was so freaking hot on the boat I was just trying not to pass out from the heat and humidity. They stuff these boats to the brim and it's a total tourist trap. The water is brown and there is little to see. Much better off doing a swamp tour so you can at least see alligators and birds.  The one positive is they don't charge an arm and a leg for cold drinks which are an absolute must on this tour if you must go. So many other fun things to enjoy; I'd skip this one if I were you. [REVIEW_8] This moving company should never even be in business. Our Apartments had to be renovated their company got the bid. They did such a poor job of packing there was damaged items all over the place they put food and liquids and the electronic items they were not shrink-wrapped!! A ton of my moving boxes were missing  as were a lot of the other tenants  they put things like my personal ladder outside where they left it and the construction company was using it instead of in my house where it should have been becuz it belonged to me... A ton of of my boxes and items were missing and I'm assuming other tenants got them and the same thing happened to other tenants... we were told we had to file a claim and we had to have  proof which whennyou have a bunch of stuff in your in the middle of packing and moving you don't think to take a complete inventory of your items so you're just basically Sol and they probably know that... It's pretty pathetic. It made my move just a wonderful experience!!! extra sarcasm added.. I would say definitely use at your own risk they are not worth it I don't care if they were paid $1000000 or $1 they sucked. The gentleman that came back to help unpack were nice but everything was packed in different boxes like three different rooms were packed in 1/2 box part of 1/4 was packed in one box part of another dark in the same box on and on.. There was no Rhyme or Reason to any of their packing skills... their training was pathetic everything was pathetic.  It was an extremely poor experience frustrating and I would not recommend them to anybody as I said they should not even be in business.  If I would have been able to pack my own stuff I would have had a professional style job done myself... there was no organizational skills with this company... there was no planning nothing. I'm not sure what happened but it was piss poor planning and piss poor execution. Extremely disappointed extremely frustrated and Will NEVER Ever ever recommend this company. I feel our property management company should receive a fulandl refund that wasn't even a job sort of done... I believe they even had an extra apartment that had overflow because all the boxes weren't in the appropriate places as they should have been.  All in all nice is fine..but it dznt cut the mustard. 2 thumbs down definitely !!!!!! It appears they walked but do not talk the talk. This was the first moving company I've ever had to use and it doesn't give me good faith in moving companies. I have an extremely bitter taste in my mouth and it is there for a reason. [REVIEW_9] My hubbie likes to think of himself as a pizza connoisseur they serve pizza; he's probably eaten there. We go to Mellow Mushroom about 3x/month and this place has the best pizza in the bay...hands down!  We enjoy the Maui Wowie...pesto; chicken; bacon; pineapple; and banana peppers. The crust is always cooked to the perfect crunchy texture and there's a great beer selection here.   Staff is always very friendly and have never had to wait for a table. [REVIEW_10] This was a great place to stay. We were in town for a water polo tournament. Jesse was amazing at accommodating our group and went above and beyond. He made our stay wonderful! [REVIEW_11] We try to eat somewhere special on our last night of a trip. This was our first visit to New Orleans. We started by looking for a Landry's restaurant since we are club members. When this place popped up we made reservations.   We were seated at a table in the bar area. We requested a low top instead of a high top table on the reservation. Don't make this mistake. The high top tables are the ones beside the window that overlooks the river. Our server's name was Erica and she was an absolute delight. She made our dining experience very enjoyable.   I started with the Captain's punch which contained rum; banana; peach; and tropical juices. It was very good. The blackened redfish etouffee with creole green beans and dirty rice sounded amazing so that's what I ordered. It was delicious.   We had a great last night in NOLA with our special dinner. This will be a must on return trips. [REVIEW_12] You think Value City; you think cheap value; right? Wrong!   Think Rothman prices with Ashley Furniture pieces. Not a Broyhill in sight.   Negatives: - Entertainment centers and TV stand selection is small; and over priced selection. -Their ""Clearance"" section is laughable and not much of a sale. No one is going to pay $299 for a nicked up coffee table that was originally $350. Go lower.  - Sectionals by themselves average around $1;000 by brands I've never heard of.  - The staff hangs out like a clique chatting in the middle of the store rather than helping customers.  -Dining sets are nothing special and overpriced as well. I've seen the same selection everywhere else at a lower price.  -5% military discount? Ooooh you're going to knock $20 off my sofa!   Only Positive: -They have a few modern pieces.   Overall:  I think they're high for low quality-mediocre furniture. Shop around town. Or if you do find something you must have here; wait for a holiday sale. [REVIEW_13] My husband and are new to Dtown and love Thai food.   We decided to try this place because of the reviews and we were extremely disappointed.   The food was bland and didn't resemble any Thai cuisine favors I've ever had.    For a place with Spice on the name; this was far from that. [REVIEW_14] The nicest people in the world work here.  I've purchased gardening goods and had a gazillion keys cut here and have never been disappointed or had to return a key because it didn't work.  I drive across the city to get keys made now instead of chancing a few trips to Home Depot. The amount of stuff packed into this place is impressive; and yet it doesn't feel cluttered.  Prices are also incredibly reasonable. Good stuff. [REVIEW_15] Really poor seating management. 6:00 on a Sunday and the hostess has seated several parties of 2 at 4 tops leaving all the small tables open and no tables for larger parties. Then suggests I go eat at the bar with my minor children. [REVIEW_16] From the second you walk in the door; you're greeted by the adorable woman at the counter. It seems if you come in here more than once a week; she'll know you're name but I haven't been so lucky since my visits are a bit more sporadic.  My most recent discovery are the vegetarian breakfast sandwiches; which are served all day! I particularly enjoy veg. sausage w/ havarti on an everything bagel. I could actually go for one right about now... I've also had the veggie club sandwich and my other half has enjoyed the chicken cheesesteak hoagie and the chicken salad on a croissant. Everything always taste fresh; they are priced really well  (I think my favorite bagel sandwich I mentioned is $2.09-2.99- cheaper than wawa!). The people at the deli are super helpful; offering menus if you can't read the one on the wall and will make great suggestions and accommodations to your needs and want.  Don't forget to grab a really great snack too while you're there- they have amazing chocolate bars; an incredible drink case; tons of chip varieties and those addictive hi-chew candies in every flavor.  I know i'll be back here; who doesn't like fast / delicious / attentive service? [REVIEW_17] During my trip they went above and beyond. I was staying at a nearby hotel and was just outside of walking distance for dragging my luggage around. One of their staff gave me a ride to the hotel and saved me from having to get a cab. [REVIEW_18] The best donuts ever.  Looking forward to another trip from Wildwood for their donuts.  The grandchildren loved them. [REVIEW_19] Horrible!!! Not only did i wait over and hour and 40 mins for delivery my order was wrong and apparently the use a cell phone as their business phone and every time I called to inform them my order was wrong the kept hitting the button to send the call to voicemail! I will never order from there again and I can't see them staying in business for very long If that's how they run their business. [REVIEW_20] LOVE this place!!! The food & atmosphere are incredible. It's so Philly... if you are a local you have to try it out to see what I mean. Oh & make sure you order the Brussels sprouts as your app & the coconut curry ramen as your dish-- my personal faves! :)",12
69,"[REVIEW_1] Crazy good food. Not the fastest service but totally worth the wait. I had the savory spinach and mushroom bread pudding and it was ridiculously good. Probably the best coffee that I have had while in New Orleans. On top of that the prices are very inexpensive. A definite ""must do"" while in New Orleans. [REVIEW_2] 1st time here. We were headed to Terakawa with the family on a cold Friday night; but they had a line out the door so we went here. Glad we did...  Excellent service & friendly staff. Waitress helped my wife take off her jacket as her hands were full with our baby; as I was tied up with the 3yr old.  I had Chicken Katsu Curry Ramen; Sister had Shrimp Katsu Ramen & Wife had Shoyu Ramen. Everything was excellent; I loved mine. Curry soup was tasty &I the fried chicken was done just right. Same for my sisters shrimp; fried just right with good quality shrimp. My wife lived her Shoyu Ramen.  We also got the pork buns which were excellent; but not your traditional porkbun.   Great; great experience. [REVIEW_3] Service was horrible; most food wasn't very good; spaghetti squash marinara was inedible. It took over an hour and the place was less than half full. As crappy as these awful chains can get. [REVIEW_4] My favorite Italian restaurant in Tucson. Family owned since the 1930's or 40's. Excellent lasagna and chicken parmesean. Why people flock to the Olive Garden over this place is beyond me.... [REVIEW_5] We have been going here for food and beer for a while; but will no longer bring our business to Pasqually's.  The owners allow a loud group of day workers to take over their joint several days a week to the point of fighting and breaking beer bottles.  Since complaining to the owners has brought no change; we will go elsewhere. [REVIEW_6] New to town and tried several in town but no availability on a Sunday. This place was open when I drove by so I stopped and they had a opening after 20 min wait. Pedicure was ok but gel nails horrible. Looked like fat marshmallow nails and so bumpy. Went to another salon few days later. Run down older salon. Needs lots of improvements especially learn how to do nails. Paid extra for opi nail polish instead of old nail polish they had as a selection. Waste of money and time. [REVIEW_7] This place is awesome! Best selection around; super friendly and knowledgeable staff and very reasonable prices. The bar is really nice and with 30 beers on tap (always 2 on nitro!) you can't beat it. Definitely the best craft beer store you will find in philly! [REVIEW_8] Full disclosure- I was a frequent visitor of the Khyber in it's previous life; as a dark & dirty; divey rock venue. I was such a loyal visitor; I refused to go to this ""Khyber Pass Pub"" for a long time out of loyalty to the spirit of the original Khyber. How dare they take it away from me! Well; I confess: I was goddamn stupid. STUPID; I say.  After hearing through word-of-mouth (you know; how people found out about things pre-Yelp); that the KPP had a bangin' menu (their words); we decided to drop in on a Friday. It was a First Friday in old city; so I prepared for a madhouse.  Not so much. It was busy; but we were seated within 10 minutes. The tables are a weeee bit too close together though. Another 6 inches in each direction would be great; but as long as your sister's miscarriage isn't a topic of conversation; everything should be gravy. I mean bacon fat. I mean bacon fat popcorn. What? I'm sorry; I wasn't paying attention. It says ""bacon fat popcorn"" on the menu. (You should try it. It's well worth the vein clog.)  The menu: Do you love BBQ with a southern/Louisiana flavor? This is the place. Pulled pork? Yes; gimme more. They have a BBQ sampler for those who can't choose. The vegan po' boy is great too; and I'm not even vegan. Their mashed potatoes are basically ""we cooked this potato in enchanted salt water and literally smashed it onto your plate."" And surprise! That's vegan too. The mac & cheese is not; of course. I burned my mouth on it from eating it too fast; and you know what? Worth it.  Huge draft list; and reasonably priced.  If you have a mixed group of vegans; veggies; omnivores; carnivores; and beer fanatics; this is the Place To Take Them All. Go during the week to avoid the old city weekend crowds. I've been there several times now and it makes me feel silly for not going for so long. But it's ok; I plan on making up for lost time. [REVIEW_9] I took an 8 year old and a 14 year old for the lunch special pizza.  We have done this on several occasions; and the kids love that they each get their own personal pizza; made the way they like.   They both ordered their pizza with 2 items and wanted BBQ sauce as the base instead of tomato sauce.  (this is the only way they enjoy pizza).   I was told that they could only get tomato sauce; not BBQ sauce.   I explained that we have gotten it this way several times before.   We were told that they don't offer it this way any more.   I see that some of the pizzas offer BBQ sauce and pointed it out; but again was told that it couldn't be made this way for them.   I asked if I could pay additional to have it made with BBQ sauce; but once again told it was not possible.   Sadly; we left the restaurant and chose a different nearby restaurant for lunch.  I'm sorry to say I won't be able to take the kids here anymore. [REVIEW_10] I went to El Camino on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. When I got there we had to wait for a table so me and my date grabbed drinks from the bar. We ordered a pitcher of margarita. The bartender came back to check on us and she couldn't hear me and flipped her head to the side and her hair landed in the pitcher. She said she was going to make another one. She pretended to throw out the liquid in the pitcher and make another one . Instead she walked over to the other bar and just added ice to the pitcher her hair landed in .That was strike one of the afternoon. Then when we were finally seated I ordered the pancho nachos with chicken. They brought it out without the chicken. I tell the waiter. Instead of bring out a fresh nacho they bring out the chicken in a bowl. Service is poor and the quality of goods is not great either. I used to like coming here but know I most likely won't be back again as the standards in customer service and quality of food and drinks has significantly decreased. [REVIEW_11] This place has gone downhill since they opened few months ago. They need to improve cleanliness big time. [REVIEW_12] Everything has been a breeze with Dr. Poblete! We are so happy with the personal contact; she is easily accessible; talk to her and only her about the health of our child by phone anytime pretty much. She has been meticulous with all of her advice and support for our child. We never feel rushed and honestly very refreshing to have access to her whenever we need to talk. We are beyond pleased with her as our child's pediatrician and the wonderful staff make our visits even more effortless. Highly recommend! [REVIEW_13] Summary: great location; great service; incredibly comfortable clean rooms. First rate. We stayed here for two nights when we were in town to work the election. Got a good deal through TripAdvisor using Booking.com . When we arrived; we were told that the hotel upgraded our room. Turns out to be a large room with huge king bed on the 18th floor with a corner view. Spectacular! Everything was clean; modern and lovely; and the sheets and comforters and pillows were incredibly comfortable. Room was very quiet we heard only the slightest noise from the binging of the elevator and the slamming of doors by our neighbors. Parking was easy; if a bit pricey; but worth the convenience. Great service on check-in from valet parking to assistance with luggage to checkin to assistance with luggage to our room. Concierge was extremely helpful arranging for a dinner reservation at short notice.  We did not use the bar which looked great; particularly if you are a Bourbon lover.  Lobby area is stunning; with renovated marble and a safe from its former incarnation as a bank.  Perfect location; a block from Reading Terminal Market and access to all the attractions of center city Philadelphia. [REVIEW_14] Once again I tried this place because my wife liked it. Semi good food but very poor service. Where do they get some of these waitresses? Our waitress with a long braided blonde ponytail could only walk by us flirting with another waiter. She never even asked us anything until we were ready to leave. Very disappointed once again!!! [REVIEW_15] Zero stars for the Chicken Teriyaki Lunch Bento Box.  I have literally never seen a bento box come without rice before.    Disappoint. [REVIEW_16] I'm usually a chilaquiles girl; so the Huevos Rancheros sounded sort of tempting with its eggs; tortillas and salsa combination. Now; huevos rancheros in general has never really appealed to me; but Tavern had me changing my tune. I have a feeling that no other restaurant's version of this dish will impress me as much as this one; but if you are in Nashville and you are at Tavern for brunch and you don't get the Huevos Rancheros.... you're making a HUGE mistake. One of the best brunch meals of my life y'all... [REVIEW_17] It just wasn't fun; or informative; or interesting; and the water portion-which is the thing that makes it different from other tours-is like 7min. and super boring. The guide wasn't great either; but for us at least they gave out the quakers at the end of the tour; being on the boat for 90 seconds with those things made the tour seem hours longer. There must be a better way to spend your money. I've been on duck tours in other cities and this one is the worst. [REVIEW_18] There's a few times in life you come across a gas station that really lives up to its expectations.  Well that would be UGas. Not only was it just as described; but the gas was beyond and over as described.  The store has plenty of snacks and drinks as well as oil and such.  There is also a carwash which I used.  Coming from Tx thru OK; well the old girl had picked up a lot of dust but she is squeaky clean now.  This is not a bad store and conveniently located near the highway.  If you are ever in the neighborhood; give it a try.  You won't be disappointed! [REVIEW_19] From the looks of it; Helzberg really don't care much about the social media comments and their customer's satisfaction. Today my wife and I just came out of Macy's cancel one of the ring I bought her for Valentine's Day due to wrong size. I already knew their services have gone to the gutter in recent years; its worse than going to a car dealership; where you get judged by their superficial eyes. If they don't think you are going to buy; they don't want to waste a second on you. So I told the first lady who greet us straight up; I was looking for a diamond ring around $800; I showed her the picture of the ring we cancelled at Macy's; all I asked is something comparable in price for a gold diamond ring. She showed me one right away but the diamond was a lot smaller than what we were looking for.  But she was able to find another one; not perfect; but at least my wife liked. I asked her what is the best price she can give us; after some negotiation; she said there is a $150 discount; and because we were still unsure (the diamond was still a lot smaller than the one in Macy's for similar price); she said she would throw in resizing service for free. It was already around noon time; both of us were hungry and I didn't want to rush a decision like this; so I told her we will think over lunch and be back if we decides.   So later that evening; I got the chance to go out alone; so I went back to the store to make the purchase. Right away I made the mistake telling the ladies that are working there I was there earlier; talked to a tall older lady; and I'm ready to make the purchase. At the time there were three of them; one was busy with the customer; one was on the phone; then there is a lady completely free. But you can tell right away she does not want to help me since I was already here before; even she get some commission it will not be the whole commission. So she told me go talk to the lady on the phone... Then the lady on the phone doesn't seem to have any interest helping me either; kind of yelling across from the store to the other ""free"" lady something I didn't even pay attention. So I'm standing in the middle of them feeling unwanted by those two. Finally the first free lady ask me whats my name blah blah... after wasted few more minutes she finally asked me which ring. So I pointed to the ring and told her what price was promised me earlier. Again she asked my name (for what reason I don't know); then she asked me if I had the other lady's card (I wasn't very happy with the first lady's service to begin with; she often answered my question in a snobbish way as if we couldn't afford the more expensive ring like ""oh that's $3000...."" in a condescending tone. So even when I told her we will think over lunch she didn't bother to give me her card.    By now; the evening lady was trying to hint to the other lady I had no reference maybe she should just sell to me like a regular sale. The other lady obviously doesn't want her to get the complete commission (also it is breaking the industry rule). While all of them keep having the tone I was just making up the price which I was promised from the morning lady! So I said maybe you should call her up; most sales people who care about their commission wouldn't mind the phone call.  At first the evening lady doesn't seem want to (too much work to make a call you know); finally the other lady also suggest she should call. So she went to the back room for roughly 5 to 10 minutes (don't know why she couldn't just call right front of me; the phone is right there!)  She comes back and told me there are not even a $150 discount (even though there is advertisement for $50 off on $299 purchase; and we always get their catelog in the mail; usually is $50 for every x amount of purchase; the ring originally is $900; which made sense when the morning lady quoted $150 discount). On top of that; there is a free $300 speaker promotion going on for anything over $600; and the morning lady said I can chose $150 discount or the $300 speaker.   Anyway; my point of writing this review isn't even about not getting the originally quoted price; I sincerely hope who ever runs Helzberg Diamonds's marketing; online marketing; social media marketing or even if just the store manager who actually care about his or her store image; can take a look at their staff. The culture they are building has changed so much since we bought our wedding band over 10 years ago. I read few other people's review; they shared the similar feeling. Their staff are just bunch of vulchers.  I worked a commission job throughout my college years; I don't know what happened in recent years. these people on commission doesn't understand how to treat their customers; and just expect the customers pay their paycheck. This mindset became very sickening to the society! And they only pride on Mr Warren Buffeft's name but not his vision! [REVIEW_20] Been here twice now.  Both times I ordered a caesar salad with chicken; and both times it was a bust.  Some of the produce was wilted; browning and bitter; and just doused in dressing beyond anything reasonable.  Counter service was so-so.  First time I went in; there were two staff members taking their time.  I was third in line; and it took almost 20 minutes to walk out with my to-go order.  Second time I was in; there was literally no one behind the counter or anywhere in sight for almost 10 minutes.    No bueno; Fresh Bar.  Thanks anyway.",9
70,"[REVIEW_1] Would never come back to this Quiznos again. We showed up at 10:50am on Sunday and sign says doesn't open till 11am; which i can respect so I waited in my car till 11am and then I go to the door and the lights are still out and it appears that an employee had just arrived and she is giving my wife and I the one minute signal through the window. We stand outside and wait; mind you it's winter and cold. We wait a couple minutes outside and then a second employee arrived and says to us ""it's not open yet""? The  employee inside lets the other one in and proceeds to tell us to wait longer in which it is 11:05 at this time and none of the veggies and sandwich meat had been out so we decided to go somewhere else. They could have at least allowed us to wait inside. Clearly punctuality is not important to the employees of this store. [REVIEW_2] While friendly enough; too many mistakes were made for me to ignore. First; I didn't receive my soda; and had to go get my waiter and ask him for it again. Not too big a deal; but then my daughter's chicken enchilada...had no chicken. We'd already begun eating; and our waiter hadn't come around to see if everything was OK. I asked her if she wanted to send it back but she said no; so; fine. The food itself was OK. We were hungry; we ate it. Her kid's meal was around $6.50; my crispy tacos $7.50; and my soda was $2. I noticed the prices on the menu; but wasn't adding up my bill ahead of time or anything because that's; you know; the restaurant's job. So I didn't blink when a check totaling $22.51 came; and I didn't pay any mind about tipping %20 (despite the faults; I've been a server before; so I can understand). In the end I paid $28. It was after we were long gone that I realized the total Should have been closer to $16; not $22.51. Did I get the wrong check and not notice? Did they add gratuity to a teeny little party of two without even telling me? Either way; that's a big no-no; right?  I wasn't being on my toes I guess; but I still feel a little ripped off. Ultimately they received more money than I personally thought the whole experience was worth; hence my poor star rating. Oh; and my butt was on fire all the next day; so there. [REVIEW_3] We received a coupon for a buy one-get-one; so we decided to try this place. We go to Qdoba all the time; so I thought this would be a similar experience.   Service: All of the staff we interacted with; while placing our food order; were very polite and upbeat. We took our food to go as we live a two minute drive away.   Food: I ordered a chicken burrito bowl and my husband ordered a steak burrito with fajita veggies. I was eating in the home office and bit into quite a few cold chicken pieces. I ate around the chicken as I have an unnatural fear of food poisoning. We live very close to the restaurant; so either the container the chopped chicken in was cold; or the meat was not cooked all the way. I went to go check on my husband in the living room and he stopped eating all together. Half way through his burrito; he found a 4 or so inch long brown hair. Yay for finding hair in your food! I asked him if he wanted me to call the restaurant and he said no. He just tossed his food; as did I.   Four hours later and my stomach is still not agreeing with me. So; go to Chipotle with caution... At least the staff was nice. [REVIEW_4] this place is out of business !! anyone know what happened?  did they move? [REVIEW_5] Terrible service under new ownership.  Old clientele are ignored while customers from owners previous job are given top notch attention.   Food quality has gone down and prep errors up.  Can no longer justify spending money here.  Queso fundido ordered with jalepenos and you get none.  If you order flour tortillas you get corn.  Dirty beer glasses. [REVIEW_6] This place doesn't want your business!! Try to call in a take-out order and they'll ignore the phone; direct you to their app (they've actually refused to take my order over the phone) or require a credit card to place an order. Going there is no picnic either. Your clothes will smell like you worked the kitchen. Bring headphones if you do go because there's no music and the noise is deafening. Constant noise from the fry cutting machine and sirens going off when fries are done. The burgers taste OK but the fries are greasy and undercooked. Expect diarrhea. I tried to give zero stars but Yelp doesn't allow that! [REVIEW_7] Got yelled at to close the door...as I was walking in....I guess they didn't want my business. [REVIEW_8] Went with a friend around 12:30. We walked the entire store upstairs and down. The 3 employees completely ignored us. There was one other customer at the register. Small; locally owned business with nice mdse BUT with NO customer service; what's the point. They loss lots of money in sales from us. Won't go back. [REVIEW_9] Can't believe this pit stays open. Like walking into a Fellini set. Disgusting. Dirty. [REVIEW_10] I have had a complete horrible experience every time I've gone here. No one answers the phone; you are put on hold forever; no one seems to know what is going on with your car; it takes two weeks to get an appointment; they give you an estimated time that your car will be ready and then they never call you to tell you what is going on. You have to end up hunting them down to get any information. The first time I went there I waited for them to call me to tell me what was going on with my car; one day service turned into 4 day service and when I finally called to find out they said it had been ready a couple of days ago. The next time I went; still no one called me to tell me what was going on with the car; I called them; they said it would be ready by the end of the day and then it ended up taking a week. The customer service is awful. They did a diagnostic on my air conditioner and couldn't find out what was wrong; I had to bring it back 3 times because everytime it was still broken. I've been without air conditioning for 1 month now because of all the back and forth. I ended up spending so much money on a car that isn't worth it. I would consider buying a new car but there is no way I will buy a VW now from that dealer. I'm going to Pit Stop on Earhart from now on. [REVIEW_11] I paid well over what I was wanting to and what they told me. and they had me bring my car in 3 times to get the problem fixed. then guess what? I got my car back and it's still doing the EXACT same thing!! no problem fixed and paid for extra shit that didn't make my car better. if anything my car is worse now. [REVIEW_12] Original backribs taste like they were cooked several days ago reheated and came out of a vending machine!Most disappointing for a place that should be known for excellence in Backribs! [REVIEW_13] I absolutely hate giving Smashburger only one star because I have had delicious food and great service in the past. But tonight's experience was bad at best. When I walked in and saw it wasn't crowded I was happy; thinking I'd be in and served quickly. I placed my order with the super friendly cashier and had a smile on my face as I sat down to wait for the deliciousness to ensue. Then I kept waiting. And then waited some more. And then a little while longer. 26 minutes after I ordered; my food finally arrived! The burger seemed to be lacking a little in presentation (the tomatoes and guacamole were not even on the bun); but surely the taste would make up for it. Unfortunately; it tasted like my fries had been ready and waiting for at least 15 minutes. And there's nothing like a bite into a handful of lukewarm fries to start a meal off on the wrong foot. But maybe the burger would be the star of the plate? After a few crunches (yes; crunches) that was clearly not the case. The edges of my burger were literally crunchy and very salty (I guess it took a few extra minutes to go from slightly charred to crunchy; hence the long ticket time). By the time I finished my meal; my fries were cold; and miserably so (and I'm not a slow eater). I would usually consider this to be one of the best ""quick"" burgers around; but for the time and cost of today's visit; I likely could have gone to a full service restaurant and gotten something of much better quality. Really a shame; but if this is the new normal at Smashburger; it can't possibly last much longer here. [REVIEW_14] Although I love pretty much anything that has to do with whiskey; I'm giving this place a thumbs down. Overpriced and underwhelming. The ambiance is super contrived (I typed that even at the risk of sounding like a huge douch-nozzle) and the wait staff are useless. [REVIEW_15] When I received my to-go order; I asked for a couple cups of water and tomato sauce.  The cashier said he needed to first take care of customers waiting to order; and he would call our number later.  Even after we finished our food 40 minutes later; we never heard him calling again.  I think we deserve better when we ordered $35 worth of food. [REVIEW_16] Honestly haven't left a place more disappointed in my life. The service was terrible from the start. The servers were very rude and extremely slow. It almost seemed like they were all extremely hungover or just stupid. After waiting for 15 minutes with absolutely no service we ended up walking out. I hear the beer is good though. [REVIEW_17] Awesome place; if you follow their instructions you will loose weight and get healthier ! [REVIEW_18] Bad experience in every way! Kept me waiting for no apparent reason; wasn't nice at all and did a terrible job on my brows. Aside from feeling scalped I am also uneven. All this for top dollar. Never again. [REVIEW_19] They treated me very badly here. I was a regular customer that developed a relationship with one of the nail techs. She did excellent work that always stood the test of time. One evening I was running 15 minutes late and I texted the woman that did my nails. Apparently; one of the employees was looking at the wrong day and booked my nail tech at the same time. When I arrived; she thought the incident occurred because I was late for my appointment and because I contacted the nail tech directly rather than the business itself. She didn't realize she had been looking at the wrong day. She proceeded to yell at me and tell me it was all my fault in front of the entire salon. I apologized for not calling the business directly and she never acknowledged her error on scheduling on the wrong day.  During another incident; my nail tech was going to come in on her day off to accommodate a special event that I had. When I called the salon to let them know due to the above incident; they talked to me in a horrible manner and that day I told my favorite nail tech (after searching for years) I couldn't visit her salon anymore. 3 months later; we finally reunited and she has since left that salon. [REVIEW_20] I could come here every day.  The ice cream is fresh; creamy; with imaginative flavors that range from traditional to crazy; and I haven't had a clinker yet!  Just today I had lavender honey; my husband toffee butterscotch; and my daughter red velvet cake.  There are places to sit both inside and outside; I bet this place is very busy when it's hot outside!  There are about ten house sundaes you can choose; and if you want your choice of composition there are about twenty different toppings for your delectation!  Nuts; sprinkles; and other toppings are available.  If you'd like a birthday cake; they make them.  If you want to take home a pint or quart; you can do that too!  This is now our go-to ice cream parlor in New Orleans!",2
71,"[REVIEW_1] Great setting. Food & service did not match the hip bar/restaurant. My friends and I (6 people) had a reservation for brunch on Sunday. We were the only table there and the bar was less than full. It took a very long time to get our drinks. Our server was not attentive. We weren't going to get our bottomless mimosas waiting around for her bc she was sitting & rolling silverware chatting it up with her co-worker. So I took our glasses directly to the  bartender for our refills instead. Food was mediocre at best. I ordered the hot chicken tacos which wasn't spicy at all. My friends ordered the lox; it was fishy and it was more like smoked salmon flakes; no actual slices of smoked salmon. Pricey for what it was. The steak my friend ordered was very salty. A very bad representation of Nashville eateries. I do not recommend going here. [REVIEW_2] I live in the neighborhood so I try to frequent Mint as much as I can. No choice is a bad choice! Also the Taro Tapioca Smoothie is the perfect cure for a sweet tooth. [REVIEW_3] A hidden treasure.  Presentation is awesome; very clean; and food is out of this world.  Deserves five stars.  Staff is super friendly and I have left there every time with a smile on my face and a full belly.  Everyone must give this place a try.  I guarantee you will go back time and time again. [REVIEW_4] Sat down over a half hour; only miso and drinks served. Waiting for actual food ordered or someone to cook it ....waiting ... [REVIEW_5] My visit this Saturday was a complete zero from the time we walked in.... The entire place was so very disorganized. The owner Jerry was screaming at his employees in front of customers and was very arrogant to his dining patrons. Our server admitted to me that things were not in place and that all of his fellow employees were confused and unhappy... after almost 10 mins of waiting for a server to acknowledge we were waiting for service he took our beverage order which took 10 more mins.... Server also communicated to us that no one took the time to review the ordering process with him prior to opening... The food did not match up to past experiences at this restaurant.. We always had Paul serve us and he always and still remains an excellent server; but his tables were all booked! We would have had a better meal at McDonalds!! Will never return to this Hell hole....: [REVIEW_6] I have used Steve twice now to do jobs at my house. Today I had him come by and replace some of the ""criss-cross"" redwood trellis that was used as a ""skirt"" around my deck. My puppy had chewed on it. Steve showed up with the right materials and tools and was done before no time. He is very handy; courteous; and does excellent work. I plan on using him again for my next ""fix-it"" job that I don't have the time; skills; or tools to do. [REVIEW_7] This was my first visit to the office after dissatisfaction with my prior dentist. I was scheduled with Dr Patel who was able to provide me a with a clear explanation of my issue along with recommendations moving forward.  The office was able to provide the 1st of 3 steps right then and there. Everyone here is was pleasant and professional. [REVIEW_8] I'd like to update my review from a few years back. My how things can change. This place is now a 1-star joke. The food has gone downhill at all the restaurants. The 10 dollar parking is ridiculous (thankfully I'm an elite player so woohoo free parking) but my biggest gripe now is this ""bounce back"" play is AWFUL!! How can you truly expect someone who goes through $1000  in 2 days time to be happy with a measly $30 in free play. I plan on taking my mom to Fresh Harvest for her birthday and after that; you will NOT see me anymore. I'd rather drive to Immokalee or to the East Coast [REVIEW_9] We tried this place because it was new to the area and we like to give new businesses a chance. When we walked in; the hostess seemed very a bit aloof to what was going on. After being sent to our table by the window; we ordered our food. My son ordered a chocolate chip pancake (with the chips just thrown on top and not even added to the batter) and my wife ordered a fish sandwich that looked like it was straight out of a bag from target. Then my we ordered a kids meal for my toddler and the nuggets were the same ones that you buy from the supermarket. Not only was the food store bought; we all got sick after our meal!! Not even an hour after we left my son and wife were running to the restroom. Extremely disappointed and disgusted with this place. I never enjoy giving negative reviews; but this needed to happen. STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!! [REVIEW_10] Tried ordering online. When I asked for topping suggestions the guy hung up on me. Ridiculous [REVIEW_11] Bus over an hour late before I gave up. Call centers not open to get information until after 6 am even though they have busses running at 4:35 am. Would not give refund and use terms and conditions item 14 as a blanket clause to not give refund [REVIEW_12] Delicious. Very good brand. Very friendly staff. Very quick service!!! There is parking ; although it may not seem so. The food is great; they have photos online with most items (although i wish they would add a few more). Not overpriced. Great location. [REVIEW_13] Awesome place! The atmosphere of this market is great. The outdoor patio area is really modern and pleasing and it overlooks the train tracks. I ordered the hummus sandwich; which was delicious. I really liked how it came with a pickle and chips and the portion was rather large to where I wasn't hungry for dinner...so bring your appetite.   The inside market has a wide selection of bottles of wine at what appeared to be decent prices. They also sell frozen tamales and other delicious looking treats. Next time I'm in Tucson; this place is on the list! [REVIEW_14] Wow what a terrible spa. I can only speak for the manicure/pedicure aspect because I did not get a massage. Typically; you go to a spa to escape and relax - you can not do that here. It is small; dirty; and the staff is terrible.   I walked in and the receptionist was on the phone - he did acknowledge that I was standing there; but several staff walked by and did not offer to assist. Finally; after two other guests came in behind me; someone came up and took me back - just to get me out of the way. Asked what my name was and left. Did not offer me water/refreshments of any kind. I've had better reception at the local nail salon. Then I had to wait for 10-15 minutes for my technician to finish up her current client; which I didn't mind because I leisurely picked out my color. When it was my turn; the nail technician was shaky and rushed. She cut my cuticle and I bled. She was sick and kept blowing her nose into her shirt (gross!!) and took time outs to really blow/dig in her nose with a tissue right in front of me! Lady; you are touching my hands with yours; you are blowing bacteria into the air; if you are that sick don't come to work - *Management; if your employee is that sick do not make them come in! You will lose clients.   She gave me the worst hand/arm massage I have ever had (that is usually everyone's favorite part; and the technician's opportunity to shine!). No pressure was applied; and she just basically rubbed lotion into my skin and made a snarky comment about how my skin was so dry is was just ""drinking up all the lotion."" Yes; I realize it's dry; probably due to the 20 degree weather and wind outside; but thank you for making me feel self-conscious.   When I went to leave the receptionist was on the phone again; but did actually put them on hold to get me out of there. I opted to put everything on my room charge; which resulted in extra fees but I didn't care. There was a blaring sign saying how they preferred cash gratuity and that there would be extra fees associated with putting services on your room. Yes; everyone prefers cash gratuity - but how tacky can you be?!!   Overall; it was an extremely disappointing experience. I have been wanting to stay at the Monteleone for years and made it a priority to experience their salon. My gel nail polish is already chipping and it hasn't even been a week. Spa Aria definitely needs a overhaul and I would recommend you go anywhere else but here. [REVIEW_15] Guy at the counter was rude; the place was filthy; and all around horrible! Would/will not recommend this place at all! [REVIEW_16] I went to this store because they carried the phone that my daughter wanted.  I had researched the price and knew what i needed. The sales Associate; seemed professional; until he told me the price of my bill!  the numbers did not add up. I was shocked to say the least.  He was trying to sell me a shield for my phone; for 40.00- I did not ask for this.  I only wanted the phone and a case. I told him about my employer discount at least 5 times.  He gave me a ""new"" price; which seemed to be more in the ballpark of what I was looking to spend.  I asked for my receipt; and was not provided a detailed break down of what my charges were- first time ever! I was so angry that I had to leave the store. I called Verizon when I got home; they were able to direct me to my detailed receipt on line.  Turns out he charged me for insurance that I was not offered nor did I want and he did not give me my accessory discount! I am still so angry over how this sales associate tried to screw me and my daughter.  Buyer beware!!! ask for a detailed receipt.  do some homework before you go if you choose to use this store.  needless to say I will never go back there! [REVIEW_17] this is probably one of the friendliest businesses I've ever been to all the mechanics and Personnel are very friendly and helpful willing to allow the way to make sure you have a pleasant visit the attendance out front take very well care of you with washing your windshields and letting you know if your inspections are due and very honest group of people at this place [REVIEW_18] Not exactly sure why this service calls itself Reno-Tahoe Shuttle when it does not service Reno...just tried to book a ride from the RENO-TAHOE AIRPORT and apparently this is out of their pick up area. Very confused.  And if you can't help me; maybe you can direct me to someone who CAN. [REVIEW_19] The lunch special Brisket sandwich with 2 sides for $10 was amazing. The brioche bun was soft and buttery; the meat flavorful and tender; the sauce lick your fingers good! I had the Mac & Cheese (made with gouda) and Black Eyed Peas as my sides with an extra of banana pudding. Everything was so delicious! The girl at the order counter was really nice and helpful; giving me tastes when I couldn't decide on a side. I would definitely recommend this restaurant! [REVIEW_20] Awful. Awful. Awful.  The receptionist barely looks up when you enter.  The ""massage therapist"" (quotes because I doubt she even went to school) Lina  had long nails and scratched my neck; both painful and still present the day after. She wasn't fluid in her motions whatsoever. She barely listened to a word of request. I said ""I don't want to do anything else; I'd like to just work on my neck and my left shoulder."" Next thing I know she's at my feet and I had to redirect her several times. Even then; her skill was completely lacking and I left feeling worse than I did going in. She said ""okay you feel good"" and walked out. No! I felt terrible and my scratches hurt. She's abrupt; doesn't listen; and actually causes injury.   Melissa the person who did the facial was WONDERFUL and I was really thinking that the place was looking up after seeing her. Excellent; excellent.   The woman who did my nails. I don't remember her name; but she was also harsh and abrupt. She asked where my friend and I worked and when we told her she proceeded for the ENTIRE duration of our pedicures to tell us how much she despises our place of employment and the job that we do. Despite our frequent attempts to redirect the conversation and apologize and explain to her why her small cut on her finger was not seen in the Emergency Department before a major trauma; she continued to bash our work. It was miserable.   Miserable place; miserable people.   Don't waste your time; there are so many better places with better people and better quality service for half the price!!!",8
72,"[REVIEW_1] Update #2. A full five stars. One more star for the best bartenders ever. Miss you BA. Trent for brutal honesty. Erin for the fastest service ever. Cindy for knowing what I like to drink better than I do and giving me reign over the jukebox. Eddie for protecting us from evil. Thanks guys. [REVIEW_2] So helpful & they had everything we needed for an event. Being from out of town; I had to make my choices by phone and online. They helped make everything super-easy. Once I got there; they had everything ready for me & helped me try everything on.  The costumes were so cute & authentic and were a big hit at the event. Remember Me was just what we needed! [REVIEW_3] Great restaurant with fresh and delicious Mexican food and great drinks. Would recommend for weeknight dinners or just a general craving for really good Mexican! [REVIEW_4] Best place for salads! I go there every time I'm in town for lunch. It's fast and veggies are always fresh. [REVIEW_5] Our sales person C.C was great she did everything she can to get me into the car; i was approved was handed the keys to the car etc. even had me put all my things from my trade in car to my new car; once we get to the finance dept. to sign the final paperwork; We were there for about 4hours that day; they tell me that they forgot to include sales tax from my lease trade in to the car I'm purchasing; which would bring my payments up to $24 per month which would bring my monthly payments to about $491 instead of the $461 we agreed on or i could pay the $930 est. now. I advise them all i could do was the amount we agreed on could not put down anything more. The next day i have Nick contact me and stated if i put down another $1;000 they could help me out; i stated  i could not; he basically told me that ""we are doing you a favor and helping you out due to your credit history; you could pay this now or later but you will have to pay the sales tax"". I felt like he was talking down to me and very unprofessional; i advised him could anything else be done since it was a error on there part; he basically stated no; and said if i could not make another $1;000 down on top of the $1;000 I' already putting down there nothing they could do; and kept saying we are bascially helping you out b/c of your credit history and just kept repeating it; when i stated i could not; he hung up the phone. This has been the worse delearship i honestly have been to; after spending 4hours on Saturday there and another 4hours on Monday.. [REVIEW_6] Beware that this place charges $18 per day for parking and a ""resort fee"" of $15 for internet access; 2 bottles of water a day and on line access to a newspaper site. I reserved our room on line; and only found out about these fees when looking at the reviews on yelp when trying to find if any of the restaurants in the resort were worth trying. I called and spoke to a manager on duty about these fees and she refused to refund the fees since I checked the terms and conditions box on the reservations page. I informed the MOD that I had neglected to read all of the terms and conditions; therefore she refused to help. After returning home I looked at the terms and conditions on the reservations page; where the check box appears and indeed it does tell of the $15 resort fee; but fails to mention the $18 parking fee.   This room was $250 per night before taxes. The room was nothing special. I've stayed in La Quinta Inns and other places that were just as nice; if not better; for far less.   I also was left wondering what happened to the southern hospitality that us southerners are supposed to be so well known for.  When I pay $250 a night for a room; I don't expect to be charged exorbitant fees for things I get for free at far less expensive hotels. [REVIEW_7] Spent my birthday here and it was heaven. The entire day I received services and all were amazing.  The shower in the body treatment room is spectacular! [REVIEW_8] Phenomenal food. Excellent service and outstanding center city location make this restaurant a must visit and a top choice in a city already known for outstanding restaurants. Certainly one of my favorites! [REVIEW_9] Great food. Great atmosphere. The decor is really nice. Modern and cozy. I had lasagna and it was one of the best lasagna I've ever had. Hubby had risotto loved it as well. Service was good. [REVIEW_10] We made it to the friendship gate; and I really just can't wait;  I found out that thing was sushi and not fishing bait; come to shop or if you're out on a date;  Don't be late to the Chinatown friendship gate [REVIEW_11] The donuts are inventive and delicious.  I had a bacon maple donut on my birthday that made my day.  the koloches are amazing.  The lattes are always perfect and do not require any sugar.  There is so much more that District Donuts has to offer that I'll have to keep coming back to try other things on their menu.  However; thus far; I get to the counter and cave for donuts/kolaches every time. [REVIEW_12] I took the free tour that lasted about 45 minutes. Tour guides were knowledgeable with a side of comical. I learned a whole lot of history and their processes in a short tour. If you don't want to go on the tour; it's still worth stopping by to see all of the memorabilia in the common area. The complimentary beer at the end of the tour is as fresh as you can get. Delicious! [REVIEW_13] Great experience -- second time at Granite City Brewery. Our server Kylie was top notch - great food and drink recommendations; service. We had the the pulled pork waffle sandwich and pepper maple bacon flatbread. Worth another visit real soon! [REVIEW_14] The burgers are fresh and delicious. Great sports bar on bourbon st.  I would definitely recommend this place if your looking for a good burger!!!!! [REVIEW_15] I wouldn't exactly call Indianapolis a food city; but Milktooth is the best brunch place I have ever been to! It is worth the wait--imaginative coffee drinks; terrific pancakes; lovely space and service. If you find yourself in Indy go here for world-class food [REVIEW_16] This is THE PLACE for all your fresh seafood as well as dining in!  Everything is delicious and freshly prepared.  We are a regular client. Chester is the man; he makes this place rock. [REVIEW_17] This place is a hidden gem on the Westside of Tucson. Great food at a reasonable price. I highly recommend the the Indian taco and their sweet fry bread in delicious. They also have daily specials like my favorite $1 tacos on Tuesday and Fridays. I eat here at least once a week. [REVIEW_18] This was a great place to have brunch with the family. It is very clean and the staff were great. I love the decor!! Plus; my four year old actually ate here!!! That is a HUGE deal. He doesn't like anything. [REVIEW_19] I am very happy with the selection here and even happier with the service I received from Charlie. [REVIEW_20] Great experience!  I went in for a routine cleaning and found the facility to be very clean and modern on the inside.  The hygienist was extremely friendly and helpful; and the doctor who performed the exam was also very informative and friendly.  I was there about 20 minutes early and was taken in right away; with the entire process only taking about 15 minutes.   It was great experience; and I'll come back again!",18
73,"[REVIEW_1] Yes; yes; yes. Reno is finally getting hip enough for cool food! Kauboi reminds me of a place I went to in Oahu...I can't recall the name; but like this place; it perfectly nailed Japanese fusion.   Anyways; we came here on a Friday night around 7:30pm. I was a little concerned about a possible wait due to the small size of the restaurant (no reservations); but surprisingly we were seated promptly. The decor in here is perfect. I love everything about this vibe. The only thing I will say it is LOUD in here! Like; can barely hold a conversation loud. The acoustics could use some work for sure.  The menu was a little confusing at first; you really have to study it to figure out what is going on; but after a few minutes we decided on the hamachi & pear; chicken soup gyoza; rice tots; and duck fried rice.   All arrived pretty quickly despite how busy they were. The hamachi and pear was delicious and super delicate. The category this dish is found under; ""clean""; is very appropriate. It was a great start to the meal  We got the tots next; they were awesome and spicy with the right amount of crunch on the outside.   The gyoza was a little surprising. I was half expecting it to be full of chicken soup; similar to dim sum; but it was actually just chicken filled gyoza in a bowl of broth. Still; very delicious. No spoon offered (this place is chopsticks only); so had to drink the soup from the bowl..; classy.   The duck fried rice was amazing! Perfectly spiced and full of crunchy duck bits with a few nicely cut slices of duck breast. Topped with an egg.   We really enjoyed everything we had and can't wait to go back to try some of the other items on the menu (giant squid?!). The prices are pretty high for he quantity of food; but this place does quality so well it's totally justified. [REVIEW_2] NOT KID FRIENDLY!  Came here tonight with my toddler and newborn and was joined by a few sets of parent friends with their young children. The staff was nice; but the clientele were not welcoming to children and made rude comments. Let's just say that a scene ensued and we showed ourselves out of this unwelcoming establishment.  The beer is average as far as breweries in the city are concerned. There's plenty of options with better beer; better vibes; better clientele; and way better suited for families trying to have fun with their kids.  We regularly visit the breweries of New Orleans and decided to try this place out for the sake of trying them all. We can say with certainty that they will never see our business or the business of our friends again due to the way their clientele treat families with children.  If you want Kid friendly; go to: URBAN SOUTH; SECOND LINE; PARLEAUXS - All have a great selection of beer; great staff; great space for you and your kids to have fun; amazing customers; and great food options daily. [REVIEW_3] The service was Ahmazing! The Meat burrito was delicious and served with great sauce!! The ambiance is real chill! I recommended this place to anyone visiting New Orleans or who lives in the city! [REVIEW_4] Literally one of the worst places I've been in years. 10 minutes to get a drink; food swimming in grease and horribly seasoned. Best thing we had was side salad and beer. Complete waste of $40. [REVIEW_5] Excellent chicken wings and pizza Is outstanding. Service was also great in this Saturday afternoon. [REVIEW_6] We actually come here often for different products; however this place needs a lot of work or different management. The management hides in the little office and never comes out to help regardless of people needing help. They need several more employees and I've sent several of my students from UNR needing part time orfull time but the hiring process is so crazy nobody's interested! Lastly most bathrooms at the gas stations are cleaner than this bathroom. It's crazy filthy. And this is supposed to be kind of a professional place. We've been coming here for a long time and these observations are over a period of consistent observation. I just finally decided to write a review. I think we will switch to the mud town location. [REVIEW_7] F*** this place I will never come back here; the people told me to pay before they did my manicure; I mean I know not many black males or males in general come in to get these things done; but dam. [REVIEW_8] One of the Best Coffee shops in town! They have a variety of non-dairy milk options and the cashier seemed very knowledgeable about the different types of coffee they offered and suggested a few of their house made syrups to add to my latte. I went with the almond maple syrup and oat milk; it tasted Amazing! I topped off my order with a vegan muffin that tasted just as good as the coffee. Thank you for offering vegan options! I will be back! [REVIEW_9] Dr. Nancy Pruett has been my dentist for over 20 years! She and her staff are caring; kind and professional. I highly recommend Dr. Pruett for your dental care [REVIEW_10] Some recent improvements in the practice:  new digs @ 8th & Walnut; walk in hours; and u can make appointments on-line.  There were some recent communication problems between the office & my RiteAid pharmacy.  I finally asked for written Rx for all my meds; hand carried them to the pharmacist @23rd & Walnut.  Got 3 month supplies of most;w only a small copay.  That worked.  The practice has (finally) gone totally electronic with patient records.  Dr Nizen is a first-rate diagnostician. She listens extremely well.  I'm still very satisfied. [REVIEW_11] I tired to be calm and not get upset . But I had a recurring charge going to my credit card and I was told it would be self payment . Because I asked about auto pay because the location was in Laplace and I was not sure if I would come back . So when I check my credit card statement there was of course a auto payment for 3 months and just this month of May their were two in one month so I was upset that I did not know because I had not been going and had join a different gym .  So to avoid me getting upset about losing money and the double charge I had on my May statement. I felt I would just call and cancel the subscriptions! Ow was I in for it . They make you send an email to them !!! And then you have to wait for a response ! I signed up at the location with ease why is cancellation not as easy ! Omg then told me I have to give 30days notice so I would basically still have to pay for June and then pow ! A cancellation fee !! Or you serious !! So all together to unjoin a whopping $57 dollars only from me visiting once !  I was so upset because I have already lost so much money and don't like the place . so I call my credit card and charge it as Fraud !! And had to be sent a card replacement because I'm not having it ! It was a lesson learned and you just would not think a gym business would take advantage of you like that . Because even when my card changed at planet fitness they did not charge back pay ; only charged for that month . Smh plz save yourself the headache! [REVIEW_12] This place is filthy dirty; and so are the workers. They don't sanitize or clean the bowls they use for Man I'd or the little marbles and they don't sanitize the tools they use for either Mani or pedi. [REVIEW_13] Local ice cream stand in business for over 55 years. Homemade ice cream; amazing milkshakes and chili cheese dogs are must try items on the menu. Bring cash; they don't accept plastic. [REVIEW_14] One of the best places I tried while in NOLA! Came in for dinner and then came in again a couple of days later for happy hour. I would highly recommend taking advantage of happy hour from 3-6 if you want to get some raw or fried oysters! It is a great deal and there are drink specials as well. Also for dessert; try the hummingbird cake! [REVIEW_15] this place is out of business !! anyone know what happened?  did they move? [REVIEW_16] I went to this store because they carried the phone that my daughter wanted.  I had researched the price and knew what i needed. The sales Associate; seemed professional; until he told me the price of my bill!  the numbers did not add up. I was shocked to say the least.  He was trying to sell me a shield for my phone; for 40.00- I did not ask for this.  I only wanted the phone and a case. I told him about my employer discount at least 5 times.  He gave me a ""new"" price; which seemed to be more in the ballpark of what I was looking to spend.  I asked for my receipt; and was not provided a detailed break down of what my charges were- first time ever! I was so angry that I had to leave the store. I called Verizon when I got home; they were able to direct me to my detailed receipt on line.  Turns out he charged me for insurance that I was not offered nor did I want and he did not give me my accessory discount! I am still so angry over how this sales associate tried to screw me and my daughter.  Buyer beware!!! ask for a detailed receipt.  do some homework before you go if you choose to use this store.  needless to say I will never go back there! [REVIEW_17] Service and food was absolutely HORRIBLE. Waited in the drive thru for a half hour before I could even roll up to have my order taken because the staff was serving out food so slow. Then once I finally got to where you place your order; I had to wait for 5 more minutes before anyone took my order. Then I had to repeat myself 3 times before they could hear my order and they didn't apologize for the wait or at least explain the situation. Then once I finally got the the window nobody even apologized for making us all wait for horribly long time. Once I finally got my food and it was cold as could be; the meat on my burger was dry; and had NO toppings on it and the buns were dry and hard. Worst service I have EVER HAD. Staff was rude and food was horrible; cold and dry [REVIEW_18] Terrible meal all around. California crispy chicken? What; two tiny silvers of avocado make it that? Frozen chicken breasts? Yuck!  Even the chocolate chip pancakes were terrible with hard edges. [REVIEW_19] After spending the night at a friend's place in NoLibs; I was in search of a place to grab breakfast and coffee; so I gave Red Cup Café a shot.  I settled on a coffee and an egg and cheese sandwich on an English muffin.  The café definitely lives up to its name in that hot beverages are served in red mugs; and the atmosphere is homey and low-key; just like the corner coffee shops we all know and love.  Much to my delight; as I was enjoying my breakfast (which was well prepared; by the way); the very friendly owner (?) Rick made conversation with me and we chatted for a good while; since it seemed to be pretty slow for a Monday morning.  Will definitely be back next time I am in the neighborhood! [REVIEW_20] Don't bother going.  The servers are too busy dancing to take your order.  Waited  30 minutes and never had our order taken.    But the servers danced two songs.",9
74,"[REVIEW_1] Probably the best food on the beaches...! Wonderful service; wonderful ambiance & GREAT foopd...! [REVIEW_2] the foods great; but no buflight on tap.i love the servers there ; especially Jamie White; whose the best server. But again. Lack of Bud light is a big negative [REVIEW_3] So; so disappointed in this place. It used to be great when it first opened; but the past two times I've gone it's been terrible. The experience Villagio offers does not match up with the price of movie tickets; food; beverage; ect. If I'm paying $26 for two tickets; over $12 for food and beverage service then I expect to receive more than 1 star service AND for napkins; utensils; ect.. To be brought out with my meal. The staff looks miserable; no one seems to care about overall customer service. [REVIEW_4] Customer service here is actually awful. Had a girl named Danea (not sure if spelling as she did not wear a name tag). She asked me what I wanted to order and was gossiping to a coworker about god-only-knows while I was speaking. When she brought the wrong item and I told her what I had actually ordered; she snapped back ""you didn't say that!"" Um; yes I did. You clearly weren't listening. She re-made the order while sighing loudly. When she brought the new item back; she walked away to  gossip AGAIN near the store's walk-in. When she came back; I asked how much my order would be. It was starting to melt and I was becoming annoyed. She said ""I can't just add it up in my head. Hold on."" Okay; more waiting. When we finally paid; I said ""can I have spoons for my order?"" She gave me a smile and started counting out individual spoons; one at a time; like she was happy to make me wait. This ordeal took over 15 minutes while people were waiting in line behind me. I've been coming to this location since I was a child but with all of the other locations in the area; I'll be making a trip elsewhere as long as they employ rude people like this. [REVIEW_5] $150 admin fee and $40 a month for a tiny gym that is barely ever open? No thanks. [REVIEW_6] I cant stand this hotel. I have had two very bad experiences here. I needed a room at 8pm one night and was going to be out by 5am and they were unwilling to accomodate or discount the rate. Im also a starwood member and they still were very unfriendly and I very un-accommodating. I would rather sleep in an alley then try to stay here again. They suck! [REVIEW_7] Ridiculous prices for small portions/little meat/mostly rice. [REVIEW_8] I have been to this location once before with no issues. Last time I got my soon a bubble tea. The pearls (tapicoa bubbles) seemed to make him sick. I hope this place does a better job at assuring the drinks/food is fresh. [REVIEW_9] This is my first review and I really felt it was needed.  I love to cook but also love eating out . It's very exciting to see all the new restaurants opening up around town and I really want them all to succeed. I've been to Nox  many times now. I have to say it's been so inconsistent last night being the Worst!!!  Waitstaff were inexperienced; appetizers came out with the dinners and only one was hot.  Had to send two out of the three dinners back for various reasons.  As you know Restaurants seem to come and go around here so please guys pay attention and remember you're only as good as your staff.  Sincerely [REVIEW_10] Terrible service from the bar tender. Unless you are a regular she did not serve us. I was standing at the bar with money in my hand and she just kept going to the same old people. Very irritating! [REVIEW_11] This is the worst service I have had at a restaurant in Philadelphia. First; they charged myself and the rest of my group a $5 cover; but then proceeded to seat us outside. The server forgot about us and we eventually were able to put our drink orders in. When they came;  we had lower than average margaritas and sangrias. I wouldn't come back here again. [REVIEW_12] Easily the worst meal I had in five days of eating out 2x a day in Philly.  Server recommended the pork sandwich over their cheesesteak - I thought; this is Philly; how could I go wrong with pork?  Wrong - pork was nice; roll was great; and they ruined it with canned gravy.  Drinks were nothing to write home about; and the place is basically a dive bar.  You could do so much better.  Everything here seems to be right out of the freezer or can. [REVIEW_13] Food is good but service is not good at all.. The guy who is working there is totally lazy and he won't come to ask you for water. Not worth it to go there.. [REVIEW_14] I've been eating here when I'm in town for about 5 years and this place used to be great. The food has severely gone downhill in not only quality of ingredients but also in ability to prepare a dish. I ate here for lunch today; saying that so hopefully a member of the staff reads this and remembers me; I ordered the dry hot pot and my gf ordered fried dumplings and the cold noodles with chili oil and we shared each other's food. The mushrooms in my dish were impossible to cut even with a knife and the rest of the vegetables had a freeze dried feel to them being the consistency of bark. The pork was a bit rubbery and only had flavor from the oil draped over everything that seemed under seasoned as well and definitely tasted old. This was labeled in the menu as a 10/10 spicy rating; it was at most a 2. I didn't bother saying anything because of how rude the waiter/host was; but I'll get to that. The rice was cold and clumped together in chunks that led me to understand that it was previously microwaved. The dumplings looked ok; but the dough was undercooked and the sauce was just soy sauce that had no care whatsoever put into it. Her noodles were very bland and whoever prepared them obviously doesn't care about their food. The noodles had the same flavor deprived oil from my dish in it; just disappointing really. This type of food is supposed to be robust and I've eaten at a ton of places across the country and internationally that do care about what the put out. This place doesn't care anymore. The man that seated us was incredibly rude the entire time. He huffed and puffed and stomped his feet when I asked for the real Chinese menu instead of the Americanized Chinese menu. And; they used to throw shade if you asked for the Americanized menu; now it's the opposite. After we were done we both had a decent amount of food left and I decided to take it to feed to the raccoons that come around my house. They look cool and I like to feed them. Anyway; the take out container was dirty from previous food in it! I was blown away; especially when I pointed it out and the rude person pretending to be a man grabbed it out of my hand and stormed; literally stormed off before I was even half way through my sentence. I was calm the whole time; not sure what this guys deal is. Then came back with the same container that he washed! He washed the dirty container that should never have been used in the first place and thought that was acceptable. I will never go here again and I hope they go out of business so no one has to be punished by this Handy Nasty food. Disgusting food and disgusting people; except for the one guy who worked there who said goodbye to us. He seemed mortified because he knew what the cuck host just did to everyone in the dining area throughout the day and I assume throughout his life. I hate this place; and I can only hate it because I used to love it. [REVIEW_15] Don't go here during late night. Fast food resteraunts in the city love to not give a shit at 2:00am and not take your order even though their open 24/hrs. Terrible. [REVIEW_16] Awesome Peruvian food. I have only been there twice but I really enjoyed their tasteful plates. Bistec a la Chorrillana is a must have. [REVIEW_17] This is actually the first negative review I've ever written because I've never had an experience bad enough to warrant one. Shit happens sometimes. I'll also preface this by saying I've dined here many times with no issue. Unfortunately; I won't be dining from here any longer. My order tonight was literally inedible. The crab rangoon tasted like the cream cheese had turned; the soup didn't taste like anything at all and there were several undercooked pieces of chicken in my fried rice. Even after realizing this; I had no intention of writing a negative review because like I stated above; shit happens. However; I changed my mind after I called to request a refund (because being served undercooked chicken warrants a refund in my opinion) and I was told I couldn't get one because ""they didn't know how to do a refund on the credit card machine."" I was then offered a $20 gift certificate to compensate me for my $32 order; which is laughable. [REVIEW_18] Never had a haircut in Mayfair but have had plenty of cuts in NYC (lived there 5 years) and Center City (working here 7 years now) with none comparing to the atrocious one from American Male.  I've paid from $20 to $100 for haircuts and I'll happily pay more for great looking hair but I guarantee it won't be found at American Male at any price they're charging. [REVIEW_19] If you are not Italian and ""from the neighborhood"" expect to get ""less than"" everything - service; time at the table you reserved because a ""regular"" wants your table; and even smaller portions than the regulars! No kidding! The food is great so I definitely recommend it for that; but everything else around the food was; well; unpleasant (and I am being polite)! It's clear the owners don't care about generating new clientele from outside the neighborhood. Oh well; their loss. The owners should take note of the zillions of other restaurants within walking distance. [REVIEW_20] While friendly enough; too many mistakes were made for me to ignore. First; I didn't receive my soda; and had to go get my waiter and ask him for it again. Not too big a deal; but then my daughter's chicken enchilada...had no chicken. We'd already begun eating; and our waiter hadn't come around to see if everything was OK. I asked her if she wanted to send it back but she said no; so; fine. The food itself was OK. We were hungry; we ate it. Her kid's meal was around $6.50; my crispy tacos $7.50; and my soda was $2. I noticed the prices on the menu; but wasn't adding up my bill ahead of time or anything because that's; you know; the restaurant's job. So I didn't blink when a check totaling $22.51 came; and I didn't pay any mind about tipping %20 (despite the faults; I've been a server before; so I can understand). In the end I paid $28. It was after we were long gone that I realized the total Should have been closer to $16; not $22.51. Did I get the wrong check and not notice? Did they add gratuity to a teeny little party of two without even telling me? Either way; that's a big no-no; right?  I wasn't being on my toes I guess; but I still feel a little ripped off. Ultimately they received more money than I personally thought the whole experience was worth; hence my poor star rating. Oh; and my butt was on fire all the next day; so there.",2
75,"[REVIEW_1] Really friendly staff .There's a white skinny  guy that always seems in a bad mood and is not friendly but other then that when hes not there the rest of the people are great . Their biscuits and gravy are off the hook. I would definitely recommend this place to everybody . [REVIEW_2] Where do I start? Brew D Licious has the very best coffee in town. Hands down. I have tried them all and can say that there isn't another coffee house that even comes close. The minute I met the owner; I knew she was not only very well informed about how to brew a great cup of coffee; but also knows how to make the toughest of customer a repeat patron. This coffee is so good that I buy 5#s at a time from Brigitte. It is always fresh and she has even delivered coffee to me while she is under construction of her new place. Personally; I cannot wait until she opens her new location. I never did care much for the Hollander Hotel and I often felt that she was being stifled by the cramped space she worked in. Also; the hotel has a funky smell (sort of like old socks) so I will be glad when she is at her new location and I can sit and enjoy a good cup of coffee without trying to filter out the bad smell from the hotel. I know it will be a long line at the new location but it will be worth the wait.... Thanks Brigitte for showing St. Petersburg what real coffee tastes and smells like! [REVIEW_3] Fresh Bar; full of delicious fresh foods with a range of salads; wraps; and soups. Yum!  On Magazine St is this great vegetarian food bar that offers a very large range of salad options; wrap options; and soup options. The set up is easy enough to grasp. You walk in; check out the menu and place your order where you're able to add or change anything you'd like(think Subway style).   There is only inside seating available with tables and chairs set up along the window and the wall. There is also a free refill station for iced tea to the side also; which is a nice tough.   You can order a salad; a wrap; or a combo which comes with a salad and a choice of soup.   I ordered a Fresh Cobb wrap that came with lettuce(you pick which one you want); tomatoes; egg; bacon; avocado; and your choice of salad dressing. It was pretty nice but the bacon flavoring was a bit too overpowering; which somewhat lessened the appeal of the wrap.   Overall; it's a great; healthy option for those who want to eat healthy. Definitely check it out! [REVIEW_4] This is probably one of my favorite burgers I've had in a while. I'm not a terribly into burgers; so that's saying something. I got the 4 Cheese Garlic burger with a side of Mac and cheese; both delicious. The buns are definitely one of the best parts of the burger. My boyfriend got the 96 with a side of fries and loved it. The only thing I would say is that the patties are very thick. So; if you're a thin burger lover; this isn't for you. To finish; I got the ABC milkshake-- AMAZING. You can see my reaction in the photo. Overall; delicious and will be back again. [REVIEW_5] Yikes; I just got that hard nasty piece of chicken that usually ruins Chinese restaurants for you. Bad; very bad. The worst. The steak and shake next door was so busy they had to close; and I should have known since no one was in line at Wendy's. most disgusting fast food I've ever experienced; crazy that this was the absolute worst. Garbage food. [REVIEW_6] Where do I start?  We've been touring the midwest staying exclusively at Homewood Suites over 8 nights in cities ranging from Dallas to Memphis; Chicago; Lexington and now Nashville.  This place is a dump.  The rooms are old and worn.  The kitchen is falling apart; trim falling of the wall; and the whole floor reeks of smoke.  The downstairs lobby was overrun with beer swiggin' Bubbas playing country music and beer pong.  Although we paid for a non smoking 2 bedroom suite; it is clear that our room is not NON-Smoking.  There is no NON-Smoking sign anywhere to be seen; and every other room on our hallway is a smoking room.  To add insult; the front desk tried to argue that hotels are not required to have NON-Smoking signs designating whether the room is or isn't non-smoking.  This is the equivalent of seating a family in the middle of a smoking section in a restaurant; and then claiming that your table is  ""NON Smoking""...  I'm not the type to slam a business with a 1-star review; but this place needs it...  STAY AWAY. [REVIEW_7] I have been to Firebirds wood fired grill a number of times now. I do have to say this is one of my favorite places to celebrate happy hour. The happy hour drink special are good and the food is fantastic! I would highly recommend trying the double black diamond martini. It is fantastic. My wife and I enjoy sitting at the bar drinking and having a few cocktails and snacking on Shrimp Tacos and Beef Sliders. I would highly recommend this place to family and friends. It does get busy there. [REVIEW_8] A sushi place that delivers? Yes; please! Everything we ordered was great - Queen Roll; Sweet Heart Roll; Summer Roll; plus some individual sushi pieces. Fresh; well prepared; flavorful combinations. Cash only so plan accordingly. We'll be ordering from them again. [REVIEW_9] I have been getting waxed here for years and have been satisfied with the services. The staff is cordial and professional. Today; however; was something different. Tyisha is a gifted aesthetician. She is thorough and careful. The wax was the perfect temperature and the removal painless. This woman is a revelation. I had a new spring in my step walking out today! I'll never go to anyone else. Thank you Tyisha! [REVIEW_10] Horrible!  I called to order an item and to insure I would be able to receive it the next day; which I agreed to pay for overnight shipping. I was told that it was pulled and ready to ship out for next day delivery. I was told that I would receive an email with this information the same day. Upon my 3rd call to get this information I was told that it was shipped ground and would receive it in 3 days. Mind you it is being shipped from Indianapolis and I live in Chicago. Will never buy from them again. [REVIEW_11] Angel has taken my furry fool in for a couple week long training sessions. I won't say that my pup is a complete model citizen (Australian Cattle Dogs are a bit crazy); but he definitely is way better behaved than I ever expected him. I also admit that I could probably be more of a disciplinarian. Regardless; she showed extreme patience with my pup and I can't thank her enough. Ralph doesn't jump on people nearly as much as he used to and can follow a number of basic commands now. Whenever I'm in town for work; I'll be happy to leave my pup with Angel. [REVIEW_12] Store is severely understaffed Waiting in line to check out can take up to 25 minutes  Avoid this store if possible  The workers are nice; but they know they are understaffed to make the profits look better as a strategy [REVIEW_13] Delicious as always! My son and I ordered a  Greek Salad and an amazing pizza.  Definitely one of the best pizzas in town! And the salad; especially the dressing; is addictive! The service is great but we go for the food! [REVIEW_14] Put this review on south street on accident; but here is my review. I took my big puppy Vader to doggie styles on Pine St. He was a smelly mess; but when he was finished with his ""spa"" treatment he looked amazing!!! A big shout out to the grooming and staff. Erin did an amazing job and you could see her true love for animals. Lily was very helpful and set me up with an account. The store was so cute. I'll be coming back! [REVIEW_15] Great place.; friendly staff and great working hours. Snow; rain or any kind of weather; stories opened on time. I love their egg and croissant sandwich and of course; it is Dunkin brands.  Place is kept well and sometime they treat their customer well by giving free donuts and munchkins. [REVIEW_16] Insane!   The best foodie joint I've eaten at for fast casual chain....   Burgers are amazing!! But you MUST try the onion rings..... [REVIEW_17] TL;DR: View/ambience: excellent; Food - Good (not great - honestly; if you're considering this place for the food; just go to Vernick); Service - extremely poor (why you're reading this review)  I'm not the type of person who regularly writes yelp reviews - I like most places where I eat and don't feel the need to write about it. That being said; because our experience at R2L was so anomalous; I felt I had to warn people about the service.   While the food was good; and the view was wonderful; we had an unfortunate experience. At the beginning of our meal; the waitress was friendly and built a rapport with us. However; there was an unfortunate incident where someone (not our server) on the waitstaff knocked a glass of water on one of us and spilled our bottle of wine on the floor. No wine got on either of us; and we were very understanding - mistakes happen. We get it. Here's where problems arose.   What great service would have been: Provide a glass of wine promptly to make up for the amount spilled and comp something trivial; like a desert or app.   What reasonable service would have been: Provide a glass of wine promptly to make up for the amount spilled.   What actually; unfortunately; happened: The waitstaff gave us a bunch of napkins and apologized a couple of times. One of about three people hurriedly cleaning us up promised us 2 extra glasses to make up for the wine that had soaked into the carpet. Finally; the gentleman who made the mistake was very apologetic. Up until this point - totally fine.   Then; after a few minutes of everyone; including our formerly-friendly server; avoiding us like they heard there was a sudden outbreak of the Zika virus at our table; our server finally resurfaced to refill water. When one of us asked whether that wine was coming out (after all; someone we hadn't met before promised it then disappeared); rather than reassuring us; this was the response; verbatim: ""You didn't finish the bottle yet. We were going to bring it out when you finished the bottle."" Excuse me?   After the flippant response; our waitstaff's avoidant behavior continued. We finished our bottle of wine with dinner; then ordered a dessert (hey; maybe this would give them a chance to be reminded by the wine stain in the carpet that they promised to compensate us for our overpriced loss with a glass?).  Frustrated; we asked for the check. After our waitress ran our card; FINALLY; upon returning our check; she poured our two drinks; without speaking a word to us; as we were about to leave.   We expected better from a such a supposedly classy establishment. We cannot in good conscience recommend this restaurant to others. [REVIEW_18] Amazing food. If money were no object; would eat here every night. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The seafood stew is unique and delicious! [REVIEW_19] Knockouts opened on Super Bowl Sunday and I have been there twice so far to taste the fare. The decor is that of a boxing ring/gym. It is very clean with a fair bit of room. It is surrounded by a dozen or more TVs for watching multiple games playing at the same time. Their food is focused on standard bar/pub fare with an emphasis on burgers and fried foods. There is a second lounge area that is still under construction. They intend to have Karaoke there twice a week and possibly a cigar bar. The new lounge has a more upscale feel to it and an impressive bar area.  On the first visit I ordered the BBQ Burger (I forgotten the name it is under on the menu). It is a 1/3 pound burger patty served with onion rings; BBQ sauce and I believe lettuce and tomato. The burger stands pretty tall; too tall for a human being to eat it. However; removing some of the stacked onion rings brought the height down to a useful level. The flavor was good and despite the heft and wetness of a BBQ burger; the bun stood up to the task and did not fall apart. I had a side of onion rings and they were excellent.  My second visit was today and I only ordered an appetizer for lunch: the stuffed; deep-fried mushrooms. The site of the mushroom heads was about 2"" across and each mushroom had been cut in half before they were deep fried. I think this diminished the whole ""stuffed"" aspect of the mushrooms as there didn't seem to be much stuffing in evidence. The flavor of the mushrooms was excellent; as was the texture of the mushroom flesh; very firm and moist.  They do have a pool table; 1 or 2 darts machines and the ubiquitous Touch Tunes music system. The staff is very friendly and I found the service to be prompt. The food took a little time to get out; but I suspect that is simply because the place is new and they are still ironing out the kinks.  I'm giving this 5 stars for a sports bar. I can't think of anything I'd change in the place. I'll update the review once the new lounge opens and I have a chance to put the bartender through his/her paces with some classic cocktails! [REVIEW_20] I LOVE this place! Great service; great tequila; great atmosphere! Try the pork tacos and guacamole.",15
76,"[REVIEW_1] The food was terrible! the sushi had no flavor. Beef was soo dry.  Potato salad was nothing close to a salad. Food was not good at all. [REVIEW_2] 3 calls to say when they'd come never happened. Our ""Guaranteed morning appointment"" became ""we'll try to get there in the morning"". Nobody can reach the installers; no management is available on the weekends; ""printing problems have delayed the ability to call customers back"" (actual quote); being told to wait 10 hours on a Saturday isn't convenient; something they touted in their sales process. Salesman **Name Redacted** thank you for ""not being able to do anything"" but being happy to sell the carpet.  (message me if you'd like the salesman's name)  Morning appointment; its 2:21PM currently; no carpet. [REVIEW_3] Change the name of this place to ""$12 a night just to park at this dump"" and maybe there is a chance at more than one star because I never made it past the less than persuasive garage attendant. It is trashy but common to charge customers park if you are located downtown or adjacent to the airport. This place is neither and has no excuse. It is located at the corner of bad neighborhood and interstate noise. [REVIEW_4] Terrible experience! My wife ordered a mild sausage sandwich because she needs to stay away from spicy food.  They substituted with jalapeño flavored anyway with out even asking; after she stated she did not want anything spicy. How irresponsible. Will never visit again. Visit at your own risk!!!!!' [REVIEW_5] We tried to go here on a Sunday night before a concert.  Got there at 6:30 were on the no wait app.  Said it would be 40 minutes max. We left at 7:40 had not been seated and was told the kitchen was behind.  The last time I was here it took a long time to get our food.  I do not recommend this establishment. [REVIEW_6] They've yet to get even my most basic of orders right (iced black coffee); and when I do order specialty coffees; they suck. I ask for extra espresso every time and even though they'll charge me for it; they rarely add it. Specialty Lattes? They'll taste like mostly milk. Service is also mediocre. They will give me the correct drink if I drive back; but who wants to have to drive back every time? Not to mention it comes with a side of attitude.   Whoever is running this place; please get it together. [REVIEW_7] This is my first review and I really felt it was needed.  I love to cook but also love eating out . It's very exciting to see all the new restaurants opening up around town and I really want them all to succeed. I've been to Nox  many times now. I have to say it's been so inconsistent last night being the Worst!!!  Waitstaff were inexperienced; appetizers came out with the dinners and only one was hot.  Had to send two out of the three dinners back for various reasons.  As you know Restaurants seem to come and go around here so please guys pay attention and remember you're only as good as your staff.  Sincerely [REVIEW_8] Me and my friend paid to get our open water certification. Dennis Koslin was the instructor and was the most disrespectful ""teacher"" I have ever worked with in my life. I put quotes around the word teacher due to the fact that this was not a learning environment. If you asked any question during the class he would not answer it and would attempt to make a joke out of you as a person (unrelated to the question you asked). If you're looking for a fun learning experience where you feel fine to ask questions; this is not the place for you. If you are looking to be respected on a basic human level; this is not the place for you. If you want to be treated like an animal and for him to speak down to you; this is the place for you.  His father (the guy who runs the actual shop) was very kind and informative. [REVIEW_9] Sorry; I have to say this is the poorest excuse of a restaurant ever.  What is up with the girls wearing stockings under those shorts.  That's nasty.  And do you guys really like when they sit next to you and act like they want to talk.  Oh yeah; I forgot it's every girls dream to sit at a table of fat; chicken wing grease covered; over 40; balding; married guys who may or may not have a pot to piss in.  But you're the same dude that goes to a strip club and thinks the stripper really likes you (dumb ass!!).  This is a joke of a theme restaurant and I am embarrassed to be a human when I see them do that hula hoop act in the middle of the bar.  I've been to Hooters twice and I don't plan on ever going again.  I guess it's okay if you just want some beer and wings but aren't there plenty of local bars that do that part better and with more dignity?  Even strip bars have more dignity.  But like Grandma used to say; ""...there's an ass for every seat"".  Grandma was always right. [REVIEW_10] It was first time visiting. and I didn't know what or how should I order my burger. but the cashier  didn't help me at all. She was so unkind and rude. I will never come back here again!! [REVIEW_11] HORRIBLE SERVICE and INCOMPETENT EMPLOYEES. I created a Yelp account just to write about how horrible the service is at this Cosi.  I work nearby so I have ordered here many times. I recently learned that there was an online ordering option; which I thought would be perfect because I am busy throughout the entire day with appointments and don't have a lot of time to wait and order at Cosi; especially during their busy hours.  A couple times I have online ordered there were no issues. My food was ready when it was supposed to be; and I was able to avoid the long lines. The other times; the service was horrible. When you online order; the estimated wait is always 20 minutes. I always give Cosi 25-30 minutes to make sure everything is ready so I can just pick it up after prepaying online. A few times I have had to wait 50 minutes total from when I online ordered because the employees did not look at the online orders as they were coming in to prepare them. My question is; what is the point of online ordering if it takes longer to get your food when you online order than when you walk in?  Today I online ordered from Cosi. Not only was my order not ready after 30 minutes; but the service was horrible and the employees were incompetent. I went through the normal line and told the employees I online ordered. The employee; without checking my online order receipt that they should have already looked at; asked me what I got because they clearly had not made my order yet. I was ordering for multiple people so I told him I couldn't remember; so he went in the back to get my order receipt which is what he should've done earlier. I ordered coffees so I went to the coffee counter while I was waiting for my order to be prepared. There was an employee busy preparing someone else's order so I stood there waiting. An employee from another register asked if she could help me. I told her that I had 2 coffees with my online order. She then said okay and just STOOD THERE. I had to ask her; ""So should I just go back to the register I was just at and wait for someone to help me with my coffee?"" She said yes as she continued to stand there not doing anything. So I went back to the original register I was at and the woman who was still busy preparing an order asked me what I needed. I told her that I ordered 2 coffees. She then asked the employee who I had just talked to and was not doing anything to prepare the 2 coffees! The employee who was now helping me did not understand the coffee sizes. The coffee sizes online are grande and gigante; and she didn't know what those meant. Don't use those coffee size names if your employees don't even know what they mean. In the meantime; the person who was preparing my food order had to come ask me again what I ordered while showing me my order receipt. He clearly did not know how to read the order receipt; which honestly a 1st grader could understand. He asked me if I ordered 2 squagels; and I said yeah that's what the online receipt you are showing me says. I honestly would have just complained to the manager instead of writing this Yelp review; but I had a 10 AM appointment and had been at the Cosi for 15 minutes and had to run back to make my appointment. DO NOT GO HERE [REVIEW_12] Sat down over a half hour; only miso and drinks served. Waiting for actual food ordered or someone to cook it ....waiting ... [REVIEW_13] The WORST customer service!!! Never going back to any dots diner after this experience. If I could give zero stars that would be too much. [REVIEW_14] I love takoyaki (octopus balls) and okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake) and almost always jump at the chance to order these when I can.  Sadly; Maru Global doesn't know how to make either.    I came here for dinner a while back and when I left; the remains of a half-eaten okonomiyaki lay on the table.  I am a beastly pig; and this for me; is kind of unheard of.  They aren't terribly well staffed here (at least when I came with a group of about 7); so if you order all at once in a large group; it takes quite a while for people to get to eat.    But on the food side; I ordered an okonomiyaki; and what I got was a pancake with a grainy; doughy texture; that was incredibly oversalted.  The consistency of the takoyaki was similarly off although I can't put my finger on what exactly was wrong.  Anyway; suffice it to say that I've had plenty of great octopus balls and Japanese pancakes elsewhere (like in New York; you can find this in the East Village in the form of Yakitori Taisho or; my fav; Otafuku; or in Philly there's Yakitori Boy).  This place just doesn't cut it; and I'm certain I won't be coming back. [REVIEW_15] I went to Sparkle Car Wash last night at 5:52 pm.  As soon as I entered the parking lot I noticed the sign that read they were open until 6pm.  They; however; were not open.  I was very disappointed.  Closing early is poor customer service!  It's no wonder they haven't gotten too many positive reviews. [REVIEW_16] Went back with my mom because I couldn't think of better competition at the time. She's much more keen to detail; specifically cleanliness. We took our food to go as she was jaw dropped at how unkept this place is. Also worth mentioning is that over my MANY drop ins for a quick coffee; the coffee counter has never once been fully stocked. Too many one star visits. Was great in comparison to the one up Easton road that closed. Now is just gross. [REVIEW_17] I would give this place 0 stars if I could. We went during Sunday happy hour and I specifically asked our waitress about specials and she told me brunch was over and there were no other specials. Come to find out there was a whole happy hour menu and 2 of the beers we ordered were on happy hour but we were charged full price. The waitress was not apologetic; just annoyed when I confronted her and said ""I didn't know you wanted happy hour"". I was confused because it is the first thing I asked her whenever she finally decided to greet our table.  She also rarely came to our table to check on us. Go elsewhere; there are plenty of better places in the area to eat and drink. [REVIEW_18] I definitely won't be coming back here. Long story short; I scheduled an appointment online to have the transmission and differential fluid changed on my pilot. I arrived on time; and I was told it would take approximately 2 hours for completion; I also said I wanted an oil change; but "" full synthetic"". He said it would be $20 more; I said okay. When it was finally done and I was ready to check out; my advisor (Brandon) give me the total cost; which was double than what I expected and paid for in the past. I asked him what was all done; he said; ""they completed a transmission flush instead of the regular drain and refill"". I told him that's not what I wanted or asked for. He went on to say ""it was good for the car and whatever""; like I'm some kind of idiot. First of all Honda doesn't recommend doing a transmission flush and secondly; its almost triple what you would normally pay for a standard transmission fluid change. On top of that they didn't even do a full synthetic oil change it was just a blend. I didn't have time to argue with him because I was already late for an appointment; but I have the email showing what I originally asked for; so I'll be calling my bank soon. [REVIEW_19] Unfortunately; I paid over $100.oo for a NYE night out at this club. It was; absolutely the worst. The bathrooms were awful and did not work. It is a 'smoking' club with zero ventilation. I literally had to walk out several times during the night to just breathe. The food was cold; soggy and unpalatable. Service was ; basically; non-existent. What a waste of a New Years celebration but a fitting end to a miserable year. I will NEVER venture back here again ! [REVIEW_20] We've been hearing of a new menu in the works for months since the much-ballyhooed original chef who developed the current one apparently didn't work out. The current kitchen staff executes the current menu rather badly. Chipotle shrimp tacos were bland and missing ingredients promised on the menu. At breakfast at least the waiter (one he showed up at breakfast) was honest in admitting that the salmon was no longer house-smoked as the menu says. Respect your customers enough not to lie to them on an easily corrected paper menu. Corned beef hash was more like chili; swimming in a sea of greasy broth in a bowl. Will give it one more strike if they get around to a new menu before improving.",0
77,"[REVIEW_1] Service is terrible; food is ok; location is great (which is why the average yelp review is currently hanging to a mediocre 3 stars).   I've been here many times. It's always about the same. Very convenient; as it's located in Jackson Square. The open window seating is great.   The food is ok; not great; but edible.  The service is where the place needs serious help. One example: I sat at a table (this is a seat yourself type of place); and the table wasn't yet cleaned. The bus boy (old man) was rude about the situation and yelled ""you need to get up and move so I can clean the water on the floor!""  Umm; ok? Maybe you should have a better system for cleaning tables? Or realize that the whole city is a little dirty and a little water on the floor would have gone unnoticed?   Overall; management is the problem. No standard protocol; and not much training for their workers. [REVIEW_2] Yesterday was my first visit to Paris Parker. I have never gone to a stylist that didn't come with a recommendation in my life until now. I was short on time and wanted to go somewhere near my home.  They told me I would see Stacey for my full highlight appointment.   She was awesome!  She got all the brassy color out of my hair and made my blonde look natural and vibrant.   Blonde hair isn't easy and I was expecting to have to go back a couple of times to someone new until they got it just right. I was wrong.  Stacey nailed the color and was really nice to chat with too! Also a must when hanging in a chair for hours.   Highly recommend... Although I may regret it if she gets too booked up :) [REVIEW_3] Visited New Orleans for the end of Mardi Gras and stumbled upon this little cafe for breakfast. Ended up coming back the next two days because the food is absolutely incredible. They serve breakfast and lunch and between everyone we tried a decent portion of their menu. The boudin omelette is amazing along with the Bourbon Street Breakfast which comes with a shot of bourbon! The entire staff is great; especially our server Joe. The whole place just makes you feel like you're eating a great meal at a friend's house. I would recommend this place to ANYONE visiting NOLA who's looking for a delicious and affordable meal. I will for sure make this place a required stop on all future visits. [REVIEW_4] Tried this place the other day the pizza was not very good at all the place before this one was so much better all home made food with it would've stuck around [REVIEW_5] Came here looking for good Tex-mex food and was not disappointed. Good service and food was fresh. Liked the atmosphere as well as it was very relaxed. Met the owners and they are two young guys trying to live the American Dream. Support them and give it a try. [REVIEW_6] This restaurant is over rated. My family went because we were new to the area and have heard great things. They are very packed; hardly any parking and you always have to make a reservation. I thought I would be happy with the food. However; when we went for dinner the menu had some food that sounded good; but my husband and I struggled to find something that we liked. We did get the California roll and that was good; but we were not impressed with the teriyaki chicken. It seems like our experience is one of the few; but personally we will not be going back again. [REVIEW_7] Avoid this place. They require your credit card when you set up an appointment. The information that they provide can be found online and they do not take health insurance. Not worth your time or hundreds of dollars. [REVIEW_8] This place doesn't want your business!! Try to call in a take-out order and they'll ignore the phone; direct you to their app (they've actually refused to take my order over the phone) or require a credit card to place an order. Going there is no picnic either. Your clothes will smell like you worked the kitchen. Bring headphones if you do go because there's no music and the noise is deafening. Constant noise from the fry cutting machine and sirens going off when fries are done. The burgers taste OK but the fries are greasy and undercooked. Expect diarrhea. I tried to give zero stars but Yelp doesn't allow that! [REVIEW_9] Vault of Souls is a $50 cover charge to get into an over-priced bar.  The ""experience"" lasts for 20 minutes unlike the escape room.  You are rushed through and spoon-fed the answers in a pitch-black room. If you want to waste your money and buy crappy drinks; be my guest. I say SKIP IT! [REVIEW_10] First and last time i ever go to this place! Kinda expensive...... Secondly there is no order in which racers get called! 2hr wait and people were just going way before my party. They do not give you a heads up of a any wait and when asked how much longer all they kept saying was ""ONE MORE"" every time; mind you 3 races after the ""one more"" if you ask me they have a bunch of untrained children running the place. Minimum wage at its finest!!!! [REVIEW_11] Service today was soooooo slow. 1.5 hours today to get simple lunch. Food was also awful which was really the worst. Oyster Po boy was disgusting and couldn't eat half of it. My colleague couldn't finish his chicken blt either because it was so bad. One of worst meals I've had in a long time. Zero stars are more appropriate. Do no go here. [REVIEW_12] MY favorite place to eat in Nashville. The food is pricey; but delicious. Many a date or business dinner spot; not some much for bringing your friends to; unless they like this type of vibe. [REVIEW_13] Disclaimer: This review is based on the Sunday buffet.  The price is $35.99.  You get the buffet and unlimited margaritas; sangria red and white; Bloody Mary; and mimosa.  These are in the serve yourself dispensers and they are in no way WEAK!  These are the same if not better than if you got it at the bar to order.  The food on the buffet is good.  Not your average buffet effort everything had flavor.  Eggs; sausage; crab legs; omelets; carving stations; French toast; pancakes that is just naming some.  This place is definitely a hidden gem and they are looking to beef up business so give it a shot. [REVIEW_14] I was convinced I did not have one creative bone in my body....and now I want to paint and be more creative/artsy than ever!  Had a great girls night at Mimosa and a Masterpiece.  Fun; laid back experience...so don't let inexperience scare you away!  The instructor goes at a slow pace and is very helpful.  Love that the instructor encourages everyone to do their own version of the model painting rather than making an exact replica.  And of course nothing gets your creative juices flowing like a nice cocktail while channeling your inner artist.  This would be fun for a bachelorette party; birthday party; girls/moms night out; etc.   They add new paintings into their rotations of classes so stay updated on new things to create via the calendar on the website.  Can't wait to go back!! [REVIEW_15] My experience was negative; I feel they cheated me here. I went twice a few days apart to buy 1/4- decomposed granite. Both times I went I purchased a yard and used the same truck. I had different drivers loading each time. The first time l was loaded and left. My pickup bed was about half full. I didn't think anything of it because I wasn't sure how much a yard of dirt was. The second time I went back I started to drive away after the operator put one bucket of dirt in my bed. He waved me to stop and told me he had only put half a yard in and added another bucket. This time my truck bed was full and definitely much heavier. I have an old S10 so I knew their was a difference in how much dirt I got by how my truck was handling.  I figured the reason I didn't get the full amount the first time was I must have driven away too fast for the operator to tell me to wait. I went back; as I intended to buy 13 yards more and get it delivered. When I explained what happened; thinking they would say no problem let us give you another 1/2 yard I instead was told I was wrong. I was told I must have been loaded with a different loader; one was a half yard and the other a full yard loader (nope; same sort of loader both times); then they told me that my dirt must have been wet on one of my trips (nope; dry both times); And finally I was told that the difference was because I bought different colors on the two trips; brown 1/4- the first time and Apache red 1/4- the second; (huh? A yard is a volume measurement not a weight measurement). Needless to say I didn't buy additional product gravel from them. (They also were going to charge me a $50 delivery charge.. I live about 5 miles away). I ended up buying 15 tons of decomposed granite from Sonoran Landscape which is just around the corner. They sell by the ton and weigh their product on certified scales so you know your getting what you pay for. They also have no delivery charge for over 9 tons. Green Valley rock sucks; don't buy from them!! [REVIEW_16] Delicious and authentic Thai/Laos BYOB that I would definitely try again.  I don't usually wander too far into West Philadelphia but I'll have to make an exception for this place. With the cute interior and the papaya salad along with beef jerky was nothing short of amazing; I'll have to return sooner than later. Especially for the Thai tea as well. Some places make it watery but it was made just the way I liked it.  Staff was friendly and attentive. Service was a little slow but it was a busy Saturday night; so it was understandable. A must try. [REVIEW_17] If you're a Latino; you're best staying away from this place. The lady that cut my hair was rude and very unprofessional. [REVIEW_18] This is one of my favorite little neighborhood places for breakfast. Cute art work; good energy and the food is soooo good and the owner so nice and attentive when he is there on Sunday brunches.     I adore the blueberry and mint iced tea that they make there; it is the best. The grits are so good they turned this Yankee into a grits lover.   It is such a fun; consistent and lovely place to spend a morning. [REVIEW_19] Amazing Bagels!! My favorite place ever! Super fast cook and donuts are fresh and they taste so good! [REVIEW_20] The next morning we were up early; filled with expectations of the new adventures in New Orleans. We decided to walk to have breakfast in Surrey; which we found on Yelp. It was a highly recommended local breakfast place. Located far from the touristy French quarters; it's a small shack-dive beloved by locals and tourists as the best in local cuisine. Even before we got there; we saw a crowd of people waiting outside. The wait for a table was 30 minutes so we felt lucky and elated to sit at the bar. We got a watermelon and jicama salad and a crabmeat omelet. I was disappointment from the first bite. The omelet was soooo rich; like it was made with cream and butter and more butter-cream on top; it made me nauseous. The salad was so plain; it felt like a joke; a few pieces of watermelon on ripped up leaves of bibb lettuce  covered with black pepper. I needed to eat something and asked for a garden salad with a poached egg. It was a poor showing with some mixed greens; a pathetically thin slice of tomato; a few cubes of huge cucumbers used for juicing and a balsamic vinaigrette mixed by finger right in front of me. The place is a tiny shack; should be filled with lovingly prepared local cuisine. It is NOT. The food; as well as the service and the ambiance are a poor showing; more hype than substance. The supposedly organic fresh juices; at $7 a pop; are not squeezed to order but poured from containers from the fridge. Freshly squeezed should be freshly squeezed. They refused to give us water with ice. How can you not give people water when its so unbearable hot outside? We paid more for our breakfast than a top French restaurant in New York and I walked away hungry and disgusted.",9
78,"[REVIEW_1] Long time regular of Hooters in the Florida and now defunct Ohio areas and had to visit this one when visiting friends in Arizona.   Ordered a pitcher of beer and 10 minutes later told I cannot have one alone.  That's ok   I remember living in Ohio the Hooters up there never gave someone drinking solo a pitcher   was just policy    even seen same policy in some Tampa stores   AFTER THIS ALL DOWNHILL.   Waitress must have thought we were mad and sent a manager over    I explained it is no problem and I seen the policies before   he then corrected saying it is a state law in a firm tone.  Ok  I was educated   very cool    he then had to be a know it all and tell me that the Hooters ANYWHERE never had a policy about pitcher serving and he knew cause he worked with the company 10 years.   LISTEN  NOW YOU MADE AN ISSUE OF A NON ISSUE;   it was the way they were in Columbus ohio!!!!!   Experienced it many times  I Did not care for the vinegar based hot sauce; and  then mr ""know it all"" had to speak up again saying Florida will be switching soon from butter to vinegar so get used to it.  Have since found from 2 Florida IMPORTANT HOOTERS MANAGEMENT PEOPLE that 1  they will never change over and 2 Other one says they are really fighting it.  The outspokeness of this manager really ruined a visit and overshadowed our very nice and sweet waitress    she was one of twins   cannot remember name though.  Beautiful store just try not to engage manager  #WillRegret [REVIEW_2] I haven't seen the book; but I think hotchickswithdouchebags.com is a hilarious website that.... Oops!  I forgot - this is a review for Pearl... in my defense; it's very easy to confuse the two.  I went to Pearl to see a DJ who I'd enjoyed at Silk City; but it was choch central and after one overpriced drink both my wallet and my soul were hurting. [REVIEW_3] Mediocre and expensive. I could not find prices listed anywhere when we ordered. This is also the first place I have ever encountered where a sandwich ""combo"" means with cheese; instead of a side of fries. They also charge you extra if you want gravy on the side. Roast beef ""combo"" was okay. It was tasty but very little meat compared to the HUGE bun. Onion rings were burnt. Fries were terrible. Mozzarella sticks meh. Oh and charged for peppers that I specifically said I didn't want but was given non the less. Will not frequent again; and I would strongly advise you to do the same. [REVIEW_4] I wish I could say it was not an incredibly unpleasant experience. She was very loud and very rude. [REVIEW_5] Define the worst Mediterranean food I have ever had.  The hummus appeared to have a good texture; that is the little bit I could see under the ocean of olive oil.  The pita bread was burned- not just over toasted; but black on the majority of the wedges.  I went home and was sick the rest of the evening from the amount of oil it had in it.   The manager was probably the worst of the experience. He told my gf he would ""upgrade her hummus for no charge; because normally it's $1.00"" but said it as if he was doing us this huge favor.  He then continued to yell at us from across the restaurant after we sat down  (instead of coming up to our table and actually having a conversation) and says; ""please let me know how your food is because that's the only way I can know if we are doing a good job or not is when customers tell me.""  But we agreed that the vibe he gave off would not be that of open mindedness and gratitude if we were to say anything about his plate of olive oil; er I mean hummus.  There is also a sign that advertises the ""cleanest bathroom in town"".... Ehhhh ok; good to know for our next road trip. [REVIEW_6] Eek no kidding. There are some positives and I guess I better start with that....The price here is not so bad; there are Chinese restaurants that have crazier prices. Also there have been some good events that occur here and tones of room.  Well and thats pretty much it. The service is not exactly the best; they only come do something when asked to. However they at least do things here...read my other reviews. The building itself is just gross; just GROSS. We saw them put paper in the food. Seriously not only that; there is a stage and there are alot of shitty events; such as old asian people thinking they can sing...really who wants to listen to this crap! Biggest headache of my life. To add insult to injury is get ready for the salties food on earth. Its like the chef have no taste buds and have to salt everything to death. You can probably get serious hypertension in this place.  Overall this is a great place. Overall score: 2.5/10 Food Quality: 1/5 Portion Size: 3.5/5 Service: 2/5 Kitchen Speed: 3/5 Decor: 1/5 Location: 3/5 [REVIEW_7] I went here today because all week I've been experiencing swelling in my wrists; neck; face; achiness and burning in my arm; and generally not feeling right. I did the usual paperwork; had to pay up front; which had I been able to pay afterwards. I probably would have left and gone to Lankenau. So; the MA who came in and asked me questions was cool; personable.... My blood pressure was insanely high; which I have never experienced before (168 over 135) and I got panicky; as the alarms and crap were dinging;... The MA definitely recognized my concern; and listened pretty well.  The Dr came in and I went  thru my list of symptoms and he totally blew me off; I  said even the fact my blood pressure was sky high wasn't a bit alarming;....He said no; I have anxiety. Made me out to be a hypochondriac; which totally isn't the case; I've fallen off rooftops and walked junk off like the queen of england. He then asks are you tired...Yeah I'm tired ; I work full time in a hospital and waitress part time; and I walk like a million miles a day; but I feel crappy now more so than usual.   He palpates my belly and asks a few more questions; then says well I think you may have mono.... But there isn't much we can do about that.... I asked if he could run an epstien barr heterophile blood test to see...He said it wasn't neccesary. Um....Ok. ""Tthere isnt much that we can do about that anyway""... Great. He says I strained my wrist. I'll get you an ace bandage....Well what about the mono possibility....ande the fact my blood pressure was insanely high....Once again he gives me this look like listen you dirty little tattooed hood rat...you have no idea what your talking about..... ""Your a perfectly healthy twenty seven year old. Your fine. You have anxiety problems; you checked off depression on your chart....."" Um. Ok. So I then wait half an hour for an ace bandage while the chick runs around bitching how they don't have any supplies; never can get anything done....(reassuring) I mean; to be fair; I probably could have gotten a better physical at my apartment considering I have a broken wheelchair;a blood pressure cuff; a buncha vacutainers; some cough syrup; and part of a trach tool kit (don't ask me and my brother work in healthcare;....and kinda hoard stuff...) So I finally get my ace bandage and ask the girl if she can take my blood pressure...SHe says she can't find a stethescope. I ask a dr passing by if he can and he pretty much laughs in my face. ""Aren't you leaving?""  Um; ok. ""why do you want your blood pressure checked?"" ""Because it was insanely high when I came in on the machine; and I was hoping a manual read would prove different"" So; in less than good humor; he pretends like he's checking my pressure (I know how to use a blood pressure cuff; he didn't set it on the right numbers or place the stethescope in the correct area....) He says  ""It's like 110 over 90. Why; do you feel ok?"" Whatta mess. For the record; my brother and boyfriend took my pressure; it's still high; and now I'm out 70 bucks and all I got was a steam punk piece of junk arm brace that I'll probably be wearing in a casket judging by these reviews. [REVIEW_8] Was very disappointed to be informed that this resturant claimed to have a business casual dress code on a Saturday evening.  Despite the reservations that were made and no obvious signs stating a required dress code. [REVIEW_9] We drive out of town to Philadelphia just to eat here. We have been here many times over the past 5 years. I can only say that the tofu soup (and everything else)  here always tastes so good. They always get the spiciness right; and we have never had a complaint here! This is a must-try in Philadelphia if you're a fan of Korean food. [REVIEW_10] Went because a friend ask me to meet her there. It lived up to all the bad reviews given. It was 7pm 3 people at the bar; bartender playing on her phone & talking to her friend at the end of the bar. No hello; can I get you something? After standing at the bar for a while she finally came over. I ordered a beer which she handed me unopened. I paid and walk to the table my friend and 3 others were sitting. At about 8pm 15 very young people walked in and had an even longer wait for her to even acknowledge there presence. I was guessing for Karaoke which doesn't start till 9pm. I left at 8:30pm. I have no idea how they stay in business and certainly don't know how she makes any money. Clearly the owner is not interested in making this a place to go. I went to the Old Double D many many years ago and I bet the original owner is glad he's gone-he should have never let them keep the name. [REVIEW_11] Horrible experience tonight our service never checked on us. We had to ask the host for boxes; napkins drinks etc. Plus our food was cold. The ribs were burnt or over cooked. The food would have been good if it was warm. Ciara was able to give us complementary cornbread [REVIEW_12] This place has gone downhill in a hurry.  When it first opened; the donuts were actually good and had creative toppings.  Now they have creative topping but the actual donuts don't taste fresh.  They have opened up a few locations and now the quality at the original location isn't there. [REVIEW_13] This place is so scummy. Do not go here. I had an entire purse stolen with car keys; iphones; passport inside and no one working was willing to even look if it was turned in; behind the bar or help me out. They told me ""it happens all the time"". Unfriendly and untrustworthy. Do not waste your time. [REVIEW_14] Went there on a Tuesday with my minivan; which ended up being Senior Discount Day. They didn't tell me before I paid that they won't clean or vacuum 3rd rows on Senior days. I got the Super wash; which included wax. They handed it over with large dirt smudges on the side; like it hadn't been wiped at all. A couple cup holders were barely touched and Some not at all in the front. The rest of the vacuuming wasn't good; with paper scraps still on the floor. I talked with the manager about the 3rd row and why didn't they tell me upfront when I pulled in. He said; ""I won't do your 3rd row on Senior Day. That's the way we've been doing it for 15 years."" I said I was new to the area and he said; ""That's too bad."" What kind of customer service is that?!? I usually don't write reviews; but this place was that bad. [REVIEW_15] As a frequent customer who has come since the place opened; I had previously rated this place higher; based on a recent experience decided to downgrade.  Myself and both in-laws had visited; one of which was senior. Had a mail coupon for $5 off; which had no disclaimer.  I wanted to apply this to our party of three (2 adults; 1 senior). Cashier gave us a hard time stating that her management dictated that she wasn't allowed to apply the coupon if we were combining it with a senior discount. What logic is that? How would it be any different if I had paid for myself and my mother in law; applied the coupon. Then told my father in law; the senior; to pay on his own. Seriously; Retarded.   This is on YOU management not that poor girl. Either for not creating a better customer experience or poorly training your staff. [REVIEW_16] Horrible customer service for overpriced drinks. My bartender(Terry; yeah-- don't go to him) overcharged my credit card without permission. I called management several times trying to get refunded for the difference; but they never did even though the manager personally told me on the phone that he had issued me a refund. Make sure you monitor your credit card statement closely when you go there. Or better yet; use cash and find another lounge. I don't post reviews on yelp; but for this one -- I had to. Bad morale is just despicable. [REVIEW_17] Awesome place! The staff was informative and helpful! The view is simply gorgeous. Great first wine tasting experience and I cannot wait to go back :) [REVIEW_18] Understaffed; with nonfunctional self service stations for car pickup. Unacceptable wait times to pick up a reserved car. Friendly staff; but painful to hear them making chit chat when you're waiting to get on the road. Better to go elsewhere at STL. [REVIEW_19] Things that make for a great date night: A beautiful date Reservations at a new dinner place Getting dressed up Finding a babysitter for the night Having good conversation   Things that kill any date night (and entire weekend): FOOD POISONING    My wife and I were so excited for our date night. I had made arrangements for someone to watch our daughter so we can have a fun evening as a couple. We love to try new places and after a little search; I found Taverna on groupon. The menu sounded wonderful and with it being in Broadripple; I thought this would be perfect opportunity to go to the Corner Wine Bar afterward.     This place is a little expensive and because of that; I though the atmosphere would would have been more intimate with cozy seating and dimmed lighting. Instead; an Applebees has a more romantic setting.   We were greeted with kindness; the service was really good; and the white sangria was fantastic which would have earned this place two stars but the way the lady handled my call; telling her my wife and I got food poisoning; made me take that other star away.    We ordered one pitcher of the sangria; calamari; we each had the 8oz filet mignon wrapped in bacon - my wife's portion was larger than mine with more sauce - and lastly tart for dessert. The calamari was really good; the meat was cooked to how we like it and and the meat by itself was really good. However my wife thought the blue cheese on her filet tasted funny and scrapped it off. We both love blue cheese too.   After our meals we got our dessert. It tasted awful and we could not finish it. However we were polite and didn't say anything. Now; if I was the server; I would have asked if anything was wrong with it because we only ate a couple bites and we didn't want the rest to take home. Oh well; the total damage was more than $100 but we had a groupon; taking a huge chunk of it away.   We sat at our table for a few more minutes after they cleared it and discussed going to our next location. Unfortunately; we didn't make it. Once we got into the car; we had to go home and it quickly went downhill.    I called the place on Saturday to tell them about our Friday night experience. The lady said that no one else had complained about their food; no one else got food poisoning and then acted like she didn't care. She didn't even say sorry.    Because this place has only been open for a little over a year and pricey; I would have expected someone to have handled this in a little nicer way. Having a child and dealing with food poisoning kills not only a date night; but an entire weekend.   On a positive note; I'm sure I lost a pound or two of my 'winter' weight - thanks Taverna. [REVIEW_20] What is this the worst overpriced airport food breakfast sandwich?  Why yes; yes it is.  Look I realize airport food is what it is on all price and flavor accounts but; this was worse than anything I have ever eaten at an airport.  This was definitely assembled earlier in the morning and just reheated.  The bacon was limp and very under cooked and the slice of cheese wasn't even a Kraft cheese single but; a knock off cheese single.  The croissant wasn't fresh baked and you feel a little robbed when you are chewing on leather while having paid over $7.00 for just a sandwich.  The coffee was burnt and old in flavor; either that or it was instant and I am not sure which is true.  There are many more options in this place and if you can't find one grab a bag of Doritos instead and you will be happier;",2
79,"[REVIEW_1] Stopped in here with my wife and a friend for lunch today. And let me tell you it will probably be the last time I visit this location.  I normally love QDOBA but this location down right sucks. From the ride ass customer service to the cleanliness it's just all around terrible. I've never had a person whistle at me from behind a ""line"" and say ""excuse me what would you like to eat"". You're kidding me right?  And plus look at my pics; this chick had her hair dangling down in front of her face and swaying back in forth and prepping food. ARE YOU SERIOUS? What happened to having it covered up? I won't be back to this location; to easy to get sick or catch something. [REVIEW_2] Always consistantly great for breakfast.  Delicious beignets; great eggs.  Try the city grits! [REVIEW_3] As a frequent customer who has come since the place opened; I had previously rated this place higher; based on a recent experience decided to downgrade.  Myself and both in-laws had visited; one of which was senior. Had a mail coupon for $5 off; which had no disclaimer.  I wanted to apply this to our party of three (2 adults; 1 senior). Cashier gave us a hard time stating that her management dictated that she wasn't allowed to apply the coupon if we were combining it with a senior discount. What logic is that? How would it be any different if I had paid for myself and my mother in law; applied the coupon. Then told my father in law; the senior; to pay on his own. Seriously; Retarded.   This is on YOU management not that poor girl. Either for not creating a better customer experience or poorly training your staff. [REVIEW_4] I am new to homebrewing and am so thankful for this place! I've been in once and they answered all my questions. I've even called in when I was having trouble getting my keg tapped and they very pleasantly helped me figure out was was wrong! I love Philly Homebrew Outlet and will be purchasing from them in the future! [REVIEW_5] Buckingham Pizza makes the best pizza around; particularly its plain pizza and a few of its specialities -- try the cool ranch pizza. This is a pizza parlor. Don't get fancy....order the pizzas and maybe some sides. While some of the entrees are good (chicken piccata); stay with the pizza and you'll love it. [REVIEW_6] Gave this store one star only because I had to in order to post a review. Went here last week to get a new phone. Service was indifferent to say the least. Staff was condescending and barely polite. Not a good experience. [REVIEW_7] Did not like this hotel at all. Me and my husband stayed there one night after getting off our honeymoon cruise out of New Orleans. While still on the boat I called the hotel to let them know that we would only be staying one of the two nights we reserved due to some issues with our home in Houston. We had to leave early to address them in person. I communicated that with the manager who stated that he would call me back because he was dealing with another customer. Never received a callback. We checked in Saturday March 5 at 1600. We left the next day Sunday March 6 at 1130. As we checked out I told the manager it was an early checkout and he said that I would have to talk to the third party vendor (booking.com) to not be charged. I was okay with that.  Fast forward to today. Called booking.com and the customer associate stated that the manager charged me for the second night that I never used as a penalty for not warning them of our ealy check out. He lied. I spoke to him at least twice about us leaving. DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU ARE OUT OF TOWN. VERY UNCLEAN AND DISGUSTING and the management is sketchy. Take your money and go somewhere nicer. [REVIEW_8] to many changes to an awesome place has made bottle works a thing of the past for me.  removing favorites from the menu.  raising prices.  and promoting only buying local whilst not using items not produced in house as a new goal are very confusing.  sad to see this happen [REVIEW_9] Zero stars for the Chicken Teriyaki Lunch Bento Box.  I have literally never seen a bento box come without rice before.    Disappoint. [REVIEW_10] If I could give no stars I would; the service team here is absolutely awful; just drive your broken car don't even bother coming here. [REVIEW_11] This used to be the old Union Station. They were able to preserved the building with all its history. This is an awesome hotel. We have stayed in many hotel in the St. Louis area and this by far is one of the best. You walked in and you have the feeling as you are in the chicago union station or New York. The staff was super warm and friendly. I would definitely stay here again. [REVIEW_12] Would give zero stars if possible. Carries literally zero lefty golf clubs for juniors. Does this corrupt corporation think that it's okay to discriminate against 10% of the world population? I will; most definitely; never be returning to this store again. Also; Jared; the man who helped me; was an absolute asshole. Would not recommend at all. Didn't even have bike parking. [REVIEW_13] Excellent brisket sandwich! Options of pickles and coleslaw as well. A variety of sauces for your sandwich! Funny and nice guys working there! [REVIEW_14] No stars. Like many people I purchased through Priceline. Got to counter and the girl said you want four wheel drive right? I had prepaid $26 a day. She said it's $27 a day for that. So I'm thinking $1 a day upgrade ? Ya. That's fine. I get a Hyundai. Then I see another withdrawal from my bank account more than doubling my charges for the rental. When I returned the car and bring up the issue the guys said it was a daily upgrade. So I argue with the manager and he says I can't do anything there is a signed contract. I said what's your name? He said dan. What's your last name? You don't need it and slammed the window in my face! Great customer service. I will never use Avis again and I will make sure no one I know does either. [REVIEW_15] When I returned to pick up my new glasses; I realized that they are horribly out of focus. Apparently they don't measure out the position of the pupils in respect to lenses in order to position the center of focus there. The staff member tried to talk me into repositioning the glasses however for me to see; they would have to be floating on my face and you can only look at he bottom most part. Umm no! Then she stated that she did measure but I don't remember such action being taken.  I asked for the lenses to be redone and they promised to send them off as urgent. Well; still no glasses. [REVIEW_16] This location has a drive-up window... great for when you call your order in ahead of time!  Also; this one is the only Papa Murphy's I've been to whose pizzas are always round (never wonky).  Nice employees; too!  Another plus at this location: a frequent-buyer stamp card!  We like the De-Lite pizzas; and the creamy garlic sauce can be a tasty change from the usual red. [REVIEW_17] I'll start this off by saying I've worked in the food industry as a server; bartender; expo; busser; dishwasher; etc for 10 plus years. I now work with disabled persons trying to help them find employment. We're not supposed to meet them in their home as per company policy. My client; who is disabled; and I have visited this pizzeria a few times per her request because it's close to her house and she feels comfortable meeting there. Today we went in at 1:45pm and I noticed it was busier than usual (typically we go at a time where it is not busy restaurant hours.) Before going to sit down like we normally do; and again this was only our third time here; We were greeted aggressively and immediately by who I assume is the owner. I started to ask ""do you mind if we sit here.."" and was cut off. He said; ""I have a real problem with you coming in here not buying anything and sitting taking up a table for 2-3 hours."" (Mind you; we have never been there the previous 2 times over an hour and 15 minutes - as I have a limited amount of time I am able to work with each client.  There also has been about 15 other open tables in the restaurant each time we were there; including today.) This person responded very hostile and aggressive. Had the gentleman asked politely if I purchased a drink or a slice of pizza we could sit and go about our business; however he met me with an extremely volatile attitude and aggressive choice of words. Again; as someone who's worked in the food industry; I understand how it can be frustrating for someone to come in and sit without purchasing anything. With that said; how this employee decided to treat me in this moment made me and my disabled client extremely uncomfortable. The rudeness was completely unnecessary and being familiar with the industry I wouldn't have minded at all purchasing something from this place in order to sit there for an hour; had I been spoken to appropriately. The part I feel the worst about is how my client was treated. I had to explain to her why ""that man was so rude"". It's unacceptable how me and my client were made to feel today. She's already treated differently in the world and she felt terrible after this interaction. I'm mortified that this had to happen in this way; and this whole situation could have been completely avoided had we been treated like human beings. What the employee was trying to say was completely justified; however we were yelled at and made to feel like we were unwelcome for no reason whatsoever. I will not be entering this restaurant again for obvious reasons; and I encourage anyone who has any empathy for disabled persons to do the same. Again; the way we were treated was completely reprehensible and could have been avoided completely. [REVIEW_18] All I really want to say is why even have a restaurant if your not even going to challenge yourself and strive for quality. Needless to say; everything that was ordered was down right awful. Never again.... [REVIEW_19] Very cute & cozy decor. Upscale but still casual. The food was all very good. We ate brunch. Will be back to try lunch or dinner. [REVIEW_20] Walked in about 3pm. Five employees huddled around the bar.  Several looked at us no one spoke. Finally we walked out.  Called the manager and told him what happened. He says; ""well the bartender motioned to you all"".  Really?  No one spoke and it was like we intruded. Rude and unprofessional.  By the way; the ""manager"" could have cared less.",7
80,"[REVIEW_1] Worst roast pork sandwich I've ever had. The broccoli rabe was lifeless and freezing. It was so cold my cheese didn't melt. The bread was soggy and wet. Horrible. If I wasn't in an airport; I'd bring this back. [REVIEW_2] Always a good choice for a impromptu night out as well as date night.  There is a great variety of choices and you can never go wrong with a burger from here. I really; really like their A2 sauce especially with my fries.  Variety of beers; as well as a full bar. And there is always a terrific special.  Not a really fancy place but a little more upscale casual; comfortable and friendly service.  Their iced tea is good as well. Dessert we always have the lemon meringue;  delicious! We hear their rotisserie meat is terrific and what they are known for but we always get distracted from trying it by one of the other yummy choices;  some day soon though; we're going to have to try it! Reasonable price for the great quality! [REVIEW_3] The best soon-dubu in the city!  This place is tucked away and once you walk in; it's like you've stepped into a Korean home.  Very welcoming; warm and inviting.  It's very vegetarian friendly!  The soft tofu is stewed and put into the dol sot pots which each and every stew feels like it's custom made for you.   You can select from beef; seafood or mixed meats (seafood & beef); mushroom; and just plain.  They can adjust the spice as needed too.  I always get the extra hot with the hot temperature; can't beat it.  The rice also comes in a dol-sot which is great if you leave it in for a while; it burns the rice into a nice crispy shell.  DROOL.  Just thinking about this place makes my mouth salivate!    If you're not into tofu; they also offer korean bbq meats (cooked in the back); with other soup/stew items.  Love this place!!! [REVIEW_4] I've been going back and forth for a while trying to decide how to describe how wonderful Elm is. Let me just say; I am always over the top satisfied every time I am there.   I would recommend trying coffee; soup; and a sandwich to get an idea of how great they are! [REVIEW_5] My boyfriend and I are visiting the Philly area from Pittsburgh and I'm so glad we found Bernie's on Yelp. The place is beautiful; the service is kind and efficient; the food is killer (I got the goat cheese small plate and the southwest burger) both were so extremely good. My boyfriend was super stoked about their vast beer menu. Our waiter Joel was glad to help when we had questions; he was great. I highly recommend coming here!  *definitely make a reservation on OpenTable. We were sat right away on a Saturday night at 7:30pm because of our reservation! [REVIEW_6] One reason why the poor review; the way they handled a news release from the New Orleans Sewage and Water Board. We are not to use water to bathe; brush teeth; drink or rinse food. The Wyndham has many foreign tourists here that may not be able to understand the the Special News Release that was put under everyone's door. I did ask for more water and was handed 2 small bottles. They refused to let me check out early. [REVIEW_7] Whatever you do avoid the asian lady (sorry i do not know her nationality) with grey salt n pepper hair AT ALL COSTS. Her work is substandard (ie i had to file my own nails to correct her shape; clean under my nails; adjust the stones on my nails). You show a design; she says okay then starts and tells you she doesnt have the materials. There was a void in my nail and she kept telling me it wasnt there and then proceeded to ""buff"" it out. I had to tell her twice to fix it. I paid im full; but will definitely watch my credit card statement for extra charges. My friend's nails came out great (she had one of the male nail techs). I can fix mine at home; I'll NEVER go back. Beware!!! [REVIEW_8] When I was with Charter 10 years ago their service was intermittent and customer service was horrendous. I've been a happy customer of AT&T DSL for the last eight years; but was repeatedly approached by Charter stating that they are now the best in the country; their whole network was revamped and that they now have zero issues. I signed up with Charter as of August 1 and the last 4 days were horrendous. The initial tech who was setting up the service was entirely incompetent and was asking ME questions about the router and the modem. The connection was lightning fast for about 2 days. As of yesterday the signal became weak; pages are taking 30-45 seconds to load and sometimes there is no connection at all. I called Charter and spent 15 minutes on hold; then talked to someone who hung up on me and was finally able to schedule a technician to bring a ""signal booster"" to my place. I live in Central St. Louis; not in a rural area; so apparently their ""best in the nation"" network still leaves much to be desired. [REVIEW_9] OMG 2 PLUS hours after a b-ball game waiting for our order TONS of people after us have eaten and left and they lost our order and said ""Oh well we  don't have your order you have already  paid for; we have others ahead of you "". WTF NOOOOO we had our order placed first it's not our fault you lost it hours ago so make OURS!!!!!!! (They didn't. ).  They came at least an HOUR AFTER us.  Forget  this place.  The WORST service  I will NEVER come back and will highly NOT suggest this place.   The food came 3 hours later and the onion rings were cold (how could that be ?. Ribeye sandwich didn't taste great and was not worth 10.00   POOR SERVICE; food isn't great; dirty smelly restrooms & I had to clean our table no YUCK!!!!! DO NOT come here!!!! [REVIEW_10] My fiancée remembered Paul the bartender from a previous establishment; and found out he had moved to the Empire Bar at Broussard's.  Amazing classic cocktails - we had a Sazerac; a Ramos gin fizz; milk punch; and he had some Absinthe (not my taste).  The other bar staff all agree that Paul is very exacting about his cocktails - the right preparation; glass; garnish; presentation.  We had the Oysters Rockefeller for a snack; really delicious - four perfectly fried oysters on a dish of spinach with cheese; served with fresh bread.  In a city with dozens of great bars and restaurants; this one is a can't-miss. [REVIEW_11] The food here is so good; they have a great patio and the staff is very attentive and professional. We had Lindsey from Seattle as our server and she was  awesome. Steak frites and Eggs were AMAZING. [REVIEW_12] I been to a lot of places but this place was gross. I am sorry to say but there was hair in my good and the waitress was rude. [REVIEW_13] This place blew my mind! My husband and I were craving ramen noodles for weeks and we went there hoping to get some tasty Ramen; little did we know that their food was unbelievably tasty. The flavors and the unexpected twist to their menu went above and beyond what we expected.  I got the Brisket Ramen and my husband got the Lamb; they were both amazing but I highly recommend the Brisket.  This is restaurant has moved to my top 3 places to eat at in Philly. OUTSTANDING food and great service! [REVIEW_14] Excellent service excellent prices vary clean my nails came out fantastic called saying they got in in 15 minutes the owner is sweetheart my daughter also got a beautiful watermelon design and she loves it will definitely be back [REVIEW_15] I don't go here for the Mexican; I go for the cheese; which is the best selection in the area. The cheese is fresh (not shrink-wrapped); they know the cheeses and offer samples; and while there are plenty that are there every week; they get new ones in. I love stopping by and trying new stuff -- the smooth and the ultra-stanky -- and finding good cheeses I've never had before. The staff are very friendly (especially if you want to learn about cheese). Try the awesome Bruderbasil smoked cheese! [REVIEW_16] Last night I paid cover and bought two overpriced drinks and then went out dancing. It was so hot and stuffy that I got really thirsty. They refused to give me water! They said I had to buy a bottle for $2. I tried to reason with them; but they were pretty rude. I have never heard of a bar not giving someone water when requested. Bartender said that 7-11 did not have to give me water either ????? So weird; and such a bad policy considering how much I had already spent there and how hot it was. I will never go back. I refuse to spend another dollar there on principle. I ended up leaving; getting a cup of water from my car and walking back in with it.  After that I was mad at them; but trying to have fun for my friends' sake. Still I told the Rue 13 photographer that I did not want to be in their promotional photos; but they took pictures of me anyway.  Finally; my tights ripped because they snagged on splinters when I walked by their stage area.  Cheap quality; overpriced; bad service. Do not recommend! [REVIEW_17] I have been several times and it has been adequate. The last two times I have been there it has been TERRIBLE. The portions have diminished and the quality of the dishes have followed suit. I mean to a detrimental degree. I would not recommended dining here. [REVIEW_18] I'd like to move in and make this my home. I LOVE this place. There hasn't been one time where I have gone in and they haven't had what I was looking for. Even weird off the wall things. They have something for everyone... all price points and everyone one that works there is super helpful. Yay for booze! [REVIEW_19] Great burgers!  Still full in the morning with a meat hangover.  Fries were excellent too.  Service was good.  Busy night but felt taken care of.  Highly recommend. [REVIEW_20] I love 312 deep dish pizza. So much so; that the restaurant was on the short list of places I wanted to go during my last week in Nashville. I called last night to see how long the wait was; and was told that there was no wait. So my friends and I drove all the way across town for dinner at 8 pm. As soon as we asked for a table; we were told that they were out of deep dish. What?! How does a restaurant run out of their signature menu item?! And how did the person who answered the phone fail to tell me that when I called to ask about the wait? I would have appreciated the warning and would probably have delayed my 312 dinner for one more day.   We love the deep dish pizza so much that we decided to stay and try the thin crust. It wasn't until after we ordered; though; that our waitress told us it would be an hour wait! We know that's the deal for the deep dish; but it was doubly disappointing to get to the restaurant; find out they don't have deep dish; and then have to wait an hour for the thin crust (which was okay; but would never have made it on my short list to hit before leaving town).  All in all; it was a disappointing night for what has been one of my favorite Nashville spots. Big bummer.  TL; DR:  call before you go and ask whether the restaurant is still serving deep dish because apparently 312 sometimes runs out of the crust.",11
81,"[REVIEW_1] Great service and food!! The portion sizes were perfect!  Will definitely be back [REVIEW_2] Where to begin; a $ 7 tip was added to my bill prior to Svc rendered. Shouldn't that be my choice. It is a gratuity is it not? My order took over 2 hours to arrive. When the gentleman arrived he did apologize for the delay. The reason I have never heard before. He told me a coworker took his car to p/u his/her daughter from school. That's a new one. So as you see; 2 hour delay does not = a $7 gratuity; nor does it = more than 1 star. [REVIEW_3] Slow service with an attitude; filthy dining and restrooms. Figured the first time they were having a bad day. Because I was craving Taco Bell thought I would give this location a second shot. There were two customers in line ahead of me and after waiting ten minutes to order and looking around at the state of the place I should have walked out. Guess I'm a sucker for punishment. Take notice and get this place shaped up ! [REVIEW_4] although i live a stones throw away and love the concept; i can no longer support this establishment. the food is just too inconsistent and despite the reasonable prices; subpar quality. i guess its still better than Goldies but Sylvan Park deserves better. [REVIEW_5] Every time I go visit my sister in law and family we stop by early early Saturday to get these donuts!  Yummy.....  The best! [REVIEW_6] I stopped by Bell Meade during a recent visit to Nashville. The best way for me to describe my experience is to say that the next time I go to Nashville I will go out of my way to make sure I return to Bell Meade.  On my travels; I tend to stop from time to time to see if I can find specific bourbons that may be out locally. At this time of year; I did not expect any great finds because many of the items for which I look have their annual release later in the year so it's a surprise to find any of them on the shelf. For example; Elmer T Lee is a favorite of mine so it was one that I asked about.  Despite the fact that I walked away without Elmer T; I still had a great time. I enjoyed a few tastes at the tasting bar and even better I had a great conversation with Max. He is one of the reasons I will return.  I did walk out with a bottle of Tennessee whiskey cream that is not sold locally and there was a bottle on the shelf that I have not seen locally that I need to investigate. As I said I will return and a five star rating from me should say at all. [REVIEW_7] This place is excellent. Best damn daiquiri I've had - and I'm not a rum fan usually and have a fiancé who is quite a cocktail maestro. Service is excellent and everyone was super pleasant. The staff were incredibly friendly and this was one of the warmest places I've been; unique from the other cocktail bars in hipster east nasty. [REVIEW_8] I am incredibly satisfied with the work they did. Tim listened to my concerns about our SUV's temp gauge and gave me information that helped me make a decision. Never once did I feel like I was pressured into anything. Professional; all the way. I really appreciate the integrity these guys demonstrated. Big ups to the mechanic Mike for A+ work.  If you can; try to schedule an appointment in advance. There's a steady flow of walk-in customers. [REVIEW_9] We stayed a night for a ""special occasion"" over the weekend. We were able to walk from our canal-side apt; mostly because we didn't want to pay the $28 garage fee. There are plenty of valets out front; someone to open the doors for you and any check in agents not busy at their station wait in front of the counter to greet you and bring you to their station.  Check in was easy and quick and the agent was very kind. After answering all my questions about check out times; restaurant hours; and fitness center and pool locations; she took me directly to the elevators. She proudly stated that there were 2 sets of elevators; with the high rise lifts being the ""fastest in the midwest"".  Between the concierge and elevators is the Lobby Lounge with a couple tall fire n ice type fireplaces and lots of comfy looking couches; tables; and bar tables. The lounge menu looks interesting and they even have a Soju cocktail! (that's a Korean rice liquor drink.) Specialty cocktails are $9. We had requested a high level room and we got the 28th (out of 33) floor with a big picture window view over the end of the canal and the White River. We had a standard double bed with oh so comfy bed linens; a work desk with a cordless phone; flat screen Samsung TV and coffee maker. The shower had a large glass door and a rain type shower head as well as 2 smaller adjustable heads below it. Fun but you can't turn all the heads on at the same time.  We were very nicely greeted with a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries after we returned from dinner; which we finished off in our bathrobes.  There is an iPod docking stereo which we couldn't get to work; but we could hear directly from the iPhone pretty well anyway.  The hotel and rooms are clean with a Vegas like feel. We looked around the fitness center; which is quite large and has lots of machine and small semiprivate areas for yoga/pilates/bosu. The indoor pool looked pretty small. Our room came with free breakfast at Osteria Pronto which has a sizable buffet for only $16. It would be a very nice stay in Indy for out of towners and I'd return to the bar and restaurant as a local.  I actually like the look of the building and think it makes downtown look more modern. Great location close to museums; connected to the convention center; and close to the mall and canal. [REVIEW_10] My husband and I have been working with Josh Stanley at this store and have driven over 2 hours; each way; a couple of times now for the expert service he has given us. I would recommend this bike shop to anyone who is an amateur or an expert rider. The entire staff is friendly and very helpful and we look forward to many more years working with them. [REVIEW_11] I went on the Paradise ship to Cozumel; Mexico. I enjoyed everything from the food; to the cruise director; Calvyn. Our housekeeping person; Sean; was the best; and he knew our names on the first day. I definitely recommend this cruise line; they do a great job at keeping the activities fresh; and there is never a dull moment. I wish I could give it more stars but I can't! [REVIEW_12] We recently used Pure Design for a large event in a nearby hotel. Pure staff met with me to discuss my budget and offered beautiful; unique flower and arrangement selections. Their estimate came in well within my budget. Their staff was always professional and their expertise was obvious. The day of the event; they created such a gorgeous space with all the beautiful arrangements - our guests raved about them; even days after the event was over! I was also able to take home/give away the arrangements; which is not always the case with other florists. And the flowers lasted several days after the event.  I would highly recommend Pure for a large event. [REVIEW_13] Definitely top rated Sushi in my book! The fish is incredibly fresh; they do not overwhelm you with rice; and they have awesome specials on week nights. The sushi chefs are very attentive and give you super fast service! The ambiance is tranquil and the restaurant is very clean...if you haven't been to sushi Rose; this is a MUST try! [REVIEW_14] Why don't we have a Target?  I thought K-Mart was going out of business.  Well not this one; this miserable son of a bitch refuses to die.  They had the audacity to try to update it.  It reminds me of Jack Palance its old; tired; and smells funny; but it ain't going know where.    I wish a shiny new Target would come along and stab this relic of a store through the heart with its superior retail sword.  I have experienced on no less than 5 occasions of a product being labeled as on sale only to be charged full price at the counter.  Then I have to stop the line to back to the aisle and grab the sign to show it to the cashier.  Once I bought a beach chair here; well my wife saw the dopeness of said chair and wanted to copy me.  I return to the store the next day (happened to be 80 degrees and sunny) and those SOB's raised the price of the chair $10.  I was pissed yo. [REVIEW_15] We had a great experience last night. The Kamikaze roll was really; really good and we enjoyed our Hibachi meals as well. Good times and great for my wife's birthday! [REVIEW_16] What a dive! It took the new owners no time to return Kelly's back to its dive status of yesteryear. The food is so-so. It's dumpy and smelly. The floor is sticky. The tables and chairs are a mess. The silverware is grungy. Not fit for anyone but drunken college kids Best to go to a restaurant if you want to keep your appetite and eat. This is just a place to watch kids puke out front; if that's what you;re into. [REVIEW_17] I order from this restaraunt all the time usually for their bone in spear ribs; singapore mei fun; chicken wings; house lo mein and order often when it wasnt that good to begin with though it was conveinent on a late night. I had ordered a house lo mein chicken wings and ribs like usual and had a taste for pineapple on the side when i receives my delivery like always i tip the driver well and before i could get settled into my meal i noticed that my pineapple was missing so i called and notified them and i wanted them to bring it before they closed for the night and they told me they couldnt and i would have to get it the next day because their driver was gone home for the next which is not my problem i called 5 mins after he delivered to my house so i dont see why they couldnt reach him its not like we don't have cell phones in this age so I felt put off and dishonoured as a valued customer since every time I order I spend about $40 every time. So the next day I call and have to re explain with my receipt in hand and order number they promised they would bring it and they never called or showed up so I waited a day then called again and the same thing happened so at this point I'm never ordering from them again such a big disappointment [REVIEW_18] Exactly what I was looking for. Got the fried chicken;  mashed with gravy; biscuits. Huge portion ; excellent service; very fair price. Will definitely be back. [REVIEW_19] Provi is such a wonderful person I came here because of her. The chipotle chicken avocado sandwich and chicken noodle soup is just to die for. [REVIEW_20] Amazing ride! Cornell is the best bartender ever. Makes a mean jazz punch! Look for him in the Captain's salon.",14
82,"[REVIEW_1] Do not eat here! I ordered general tso tofu and asked for it to be extra crispy with light sauce. Not only did it come out FULL of sauce; but they refused to replace it and only offered to drain the extra sauce. Needless to say; it was bland and soggy. Never again. [REVIEW_2] OMG the Mediterranean chicken quesadillas what awesome sauce. Definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys fresh Greek food [REVIEW_3] This place is horrible! I recently purchased a jeep from there; and everything seemed great at first. Not 2 days after purchasing the jeep; the front left brake locked up and almost threw me off the road. So I brought the vehicle back and they fixed the front left brake..... Wouldn't you think to check the other one? They didn't and 4 months later the front right brake does the same thing...... Now they say oh well and I have to fork over a bunch of money to fix it! If I spend 30k on a jeep; I shouldn't have these kind of issues nor should I be responsible for it. This place is a disgrace and I  will actively tell people never to go there!!!! Run away from this scam of a place!!! [REVIEW_4] I had heard good things about Fresh Produce but I have to say I was not impressed. I noticed that my sunflowers and blueberries were moldy upon arriving home.  The tomatoes there were all bruised and mushy.  The only thing I think that I might be happy with are my apples.  Not to mention; the woman that rang me up threw around my produce and bruised it all up.  I won't be back. [REVIEW_5] We were in St Pete on the weekend and decide to eat sushi. The worst sushi ever! Never go there again. All 3 or 4 king of sushi we ordered was terrible. [REVIEW_6] Friday's  Bartender must own the place;  be related to the owner;   or have pictures  of someone in charge............What an Arsehole!!!!;  How does this guy stay in business??;  the attached  bowling alley must be the answer..............avoid this place;   bowling alley is great though;  what a shame [REVIEW_7] Came in to order coctel de camaron my food had no avocado no cilantro asked the waiter as to why it did not have it they said they were out of avocado and did not know why it had no cilantro. Just said ;I can take the plate back poor customer service it seemed like they didn't care. Very disappointing; how can a restaurant not have avocado and what's worst nobody seemed to care. I was so eager to eat this establish food now am just leaving wothout eating nothing. [REVIEW_8] This hotel is so dog friendly we love it...everyone is so nice just stayed this weekened loved it...they serve starbucks coffee;beautiful room and pool;  I would only stay here in the area ... such a nice staff... The nighttime mgr is a young lady who is especially nice she helped us check in and throughout our stay...hotel is so clean...   beautiful so conveinant to everything love it... [REVIEW_9] Disappointing experience beginning with confusion with order and computer software. Had to place my order 3x; chicken wrap was okay but not spectacular; served with fries that were frozen  in the middle and soggy. Not what I expected for 10.00. [REVIEW_10] In a week of beer and wine tasting in Southern California this place had the standout beer!  Their XII quad was to die for.  I'm usually an IPA man where my wife usually goes for porters and stouts and this one hit the spot with both of us.    Nice bar area and friendly staff close to other wine and beer tasting rooms in the Funk Zone - definitely worth going the extra couple of blocks for it. [REVIEW_11] So disappointing.....after living in the area for many years and ate there on many occasions I decided to stop for lunch. What I discovered that it is now fast food Mexican with no regaurd to your choice of toppings! Disgusting and not worth my money or time any longer..... So many better ""quick"" eats on the westside that probably would have been better - no more visits for me!  p.s. would've asked for a refund. But in this day and age didn't want to start any drama - [REVIEW_12] horrible food! waited for my nachos that took forever!!!! when they came they were freezing cold even the chips highly disappointed wish i could've given them  no stars they do not deserve any of my stars [REVIEW_13] I came here for a Sunday lunch. Didn't expect much; since it always seems touristy. If you want reheated frozen food; this is your place. Decor is not good; food is not good. Boo. Bathroom was clean. That's earns it A star.  Poor tourists! If they come to Philly and come here; they are getting a very poor representation of what Philly has to offer in dining. Very poor; indeed! Take a picture of the mural and keep walking. There are many; many better places on South St. and around the corners on 2nd; 3rd; and 4th streets. [REVIEW_14] This place is a joke. Never going there again. No concept of customer service at all. Food is mediocre at best. [REVIEW_15] So disappointed with this place. Read great reviews and had high hopes. We ordered Singapore noodles; honey garlic chicken; chicken balls & Chicken fried rice. Very bland taste; most of it went to the bin. For all you Irish people that are expecting it to be as good as home; it most certainly is nothing like it. [REVIEW_16] I have stayed at this hotel twice and I will definitely return again.  The hotel and the rooms are clean.  This place has been remodeled.  Apparently it used to be an Adam's Mark; but got a makeover once it was purchased by Hyatt.  We had a partial view of the arch and the historic courthouse.  I like that there is a Starbucks in the lobby.  We ate at the sports bar in the lobby a few times as well.  The food there was always good and the prices were reasonable.  I understand that the price of the overnight parking might be a point of contention for some; but I think it is not unreasonable for a hotel that is downtown in a metropolitan city.  If you are traveling to downtown St. Louis (especially for a baseball game - Busch Stadium is very close) I would absolutely recommend staying here. [REVIEW_17] I was sort of unsure how to rate this place. I had a similar experience to Sara P.  I joined in October. Got a GREAT workout. It was really enjoyable and definitely challenging. In December; emails about fraud; theft; employees leaving started coming.  My husband and I had purchased; but didn't get to use yet; 10 classes each for $85.  The new owners wouldn't recognize the 10 classes; but we can each have $85 credit. I was told we had till the end of Feb to covert the credit to classes but the owner said I may want to wait; as she offers specials in February.  I email this week about a deal they have for 5 classes for $47. I get an email back that I can't use the credits for special deals.  What??? I just want to use my credits; and walk away. It doesn't seem to me that this place is fixed at all. There are plenty of places in Philadelphia where I can work out and not have to worry about all this drama. The workout is a 4-5 star. The ethics is a 1. [REVIEW_18] Ugh.  Next to the 8.5"" x 11"" piece of paper menu; this place committed my 2nd least favorite Philly Food Establishment No-No: One Waiter to Rule them All.  Food proprietors; I have a questions for you.  It's lunch time; you're located downtown; it's your busiest time.  How many waiters do you staff?  If  you answered ""one""; please stop.  I know times are tough but waiting 45 minutes for 4 cubes of chicken in combination with some rice is not appropriate; especially at lunch time.    This one was especially bad.  He wasn't lazy but just awkward.  And he did all the food at one time; seemingly.    The food was delicious but I barely remember it as I was suffering from ""foodsanity"" where I was waiting so long that I forgot why I had come there in the first place. [REVIEW_19] So I was starving  and craving tacos ; I walk in and nobody was there just the workers . I ordered ; paid for it and went home . Those were the worst tacos of my life; this is sad day. My stomach still hurts from the pain I felt and the disappointment. It's sad that  workers today have no pride in what they make . I love tacos so much; I will not return [REVIEW_20] Austin  Martinez (director of operations) & Steven (our server) went above and beyond with our table. Awesome guys and great atmosphere. Made our Friday night experience wonderful. My friends and I will definitely be back to this great clayton spot!",5
83,"[REVIEW_1] Pulled pork and fried fish are great.    Don't miss the sweet tea.  My wife had the white beans and cold slaw really good much better than my Mac and cheese and potatoe salad.    But a must eat if you love bbq. [REVIEW_2] I couldn't be happier with this place. The food and the service were both so wonderful. I had never had a sushi burrito before; and was a bit skeptical; but it was perfect for me. Our server Kory was the sweetest. Our table had sushi burritos; crab rangoons; and my husband got Pho which he also had never had before. We were all very happy with the people who worked there and the food. They had this ""original spicy sauce"" that was delicious; it had such great flavor; it wasn't just hot. Next time I go I will definitely try some Boba tea; I've been wanting to try it but haven't yet. I think this would be the perfect place to try it. Looking forward to going back here again soon! [REVIEW_3] This grovstyles is very unprofessional and took forever for my order to come in and never do I shop there again [REVIEW_4] I recently dined there for a birthday gathering. The restaurant was mostly vacant and our 20 person party was placed in the back. We were assigned 1 waiter who worked his hardest to serve a party so large; however; drinks were late and not refilled; silverware was dirty with old food from previous customers (in multiple sets); and food came out late. I have worked customer service and usually ignore the small mistakes. We are all human. However; our waiter should not have been alone in serving a party so large.   Moreover; a glass shard damaged my pants and scratched me from sitting on my chair. The manager on duty gave me a bandaid and contact information to relay my experience. I feel like I needed to explain my experience and my disappointment of the way the situation was handled to the point of not returning. We paid for our meal in full and left with a bloody rip in my pants. [REVIEW_5] I came to Buff Beauty Bar for the first time today - Jordan was very welcoming in person and over the phone. She is also my fav. because she offered me champagne :)  Michie did a fantastic job with my pedicure and shellac manicure. The foot massage felt amazing; polish application were perfect on both services and she did not rush. I highly recommend her for the pedicure.   I can't wait to book my next appointment! [REVIEW_6] Truly outstanding food....with among the friendliest and most enthusiastic service I have experienced.  This place is a must and should be on your rotation....  Please support your locally owned businesses !! [REVIEW_7] Best donut shop in STL!!! Family owned; clean; truly great service by people that care and know you! The donuts are amazing. Handmade every morning! It's packed every day. Great breakfast sandwiches too! [REVIEW_8] We had already spend a long while walking around through the parade and wanted to kill time before we got oysters. We were waiting for the line to die down at two other places but came across Creole House on the way to French quarter. The line was short and it was only a 20 minute wait. I am an oyster fiend. Living in NYC I got oysters every other night enjoying 2-3 dozens by myself. Thinking the oysters would be delicious ; I ordered 2 dozens and so did my sister. We also shared a cup of gumbo. My sisters friend had a shrimp po boy with fries. After half a dozen oysters I started to feel nauseous. I didn't want to waste any oysters so I suffered though the first dozen. My sister has a strong stomach and finish 1.5 dozen. I couldn't eat anymore. The gumbo was terrible. It had no flavor; it was so tiny for 7 dollars(we had way better gumbo at another place the day after for way less). We had a taste of the po boy as well. It was just ok. My sisters friend didn't finish it either. The fries came fresh out the freezer I'm sure. Dry and scrawny little things. Should've just gone to French quarter and ate at one of the other places. Probably would've been better since the lines were longer. Would've been worth the wait. What a waste of money. And stomach space. [REVIEW_9] Don't be deterred by having to walk into a gas station! The price is right and the meat is GREAT! Try the jerk sauce on your BBQ...it was DEEELISH! [REVIEW_10] We have known Meridith for many years and through several of her restaurant ventures. We recently used her catering service Aneu for a birthday party and couldn't have been more pleased. Her planning and performance were perfect. The two servers she sent were very professional and the food garnered rave reviews from both our guests and from us. Everything from initial planning to final cleanup went without a hitch and her personal attention to detail was perfect. Highly recommended!!!!!! [REVIEW_11] It is amazing that a restaurant can maintain its high standards and reasonable prices over so many years.  I started eating at Caruso's many years ago when I attended UA.  Upon my return to Tucson I was surprised to see that it was still open and still great!  They have a wonderful hearty red sauce which enhances every dish on which it is used.  The manicotti and parmesan dishes are outstanding.  Their house Italian dressing is my favorite anywhere.  They do have a special lunch menu.  They do not take reservations for smaller parties; so it is good to come early for weekend dinner to avoid a wait for a table. [REVIEW_12] By far the best margarita and Moscow Mule I've had! The Garden Margarita has fresh cilantro and cucumber with a salt and pepper rim and was seriously unlike anything else I've tasted. The MM was perfectly mixed and had fresh ginger - that bartender is genius! We popped in for drinks and a snack; and the guacamole was phenomenal. The decor is fun; it's right by the college; and the food and drinks are on point! Definitely a must-do while you're in town! [REVIEW_13] Love this place; love the ice cream; love the cool feel of it; love the chalkboard menu. Just great! [REVIEW_14] I'm not really sure why I bother going to other restaurants.   Every Valentine's Day I try to find some cute; new little BYO for me and my boyfriend to try out and I spend weeks scouring menus and Yelp reviews.   Every year SOMETHING goes wrong and I get frustrated and pissed off and he always says ""Let's go to Jones"".  This year was no different. We went out last night (2/12/11...the weekend before Valentines Day) to the BYO I picked out and when I made our reservations; no mention was made that they had a special fixed menu that night consisting SOLELY of seafood; which I am allergic to. As I started to get upset at our table; my boyfriend said ""Let's go to Jones"".  We got there; were told there was a little bit of a wait; so we sat at the bar for a drink. About 5-10 minutes later they came and got us and sat us at our table. Our waiter (who was WONDERFUL and looked like Jared Leto - extra bonus-) came over and took our order and the food came out perfectly (as usual) and right on time.  We both got the filet; done rare and the spinach it came with was fantastic. The mac and cheese is also an app we get every time and is one of my favorites. I got the deviled eggs for the first time and holy crap they were amazing. I'm gonna say; possibly the best ones I've ever had (sorry; Dad).   Everything about this restaurant leans towards comfort and it's always done so well. The atmosphere; the staff; the decor; the food; hell even the temperature. I've never had a bad experience at Jones and I don't think I ever will.   Next year....we'll just go straight to Jones. [REVIEW_15] Excellent fresh French pastry- so light; crisp; buttery you could suck down three or four before realizing what a decadent pig you were!! Toasted croissants filled with variety of meats; cheeses; veggies- all so good!! Coffee excellent; espresso spot on.  This is lunch and breakfast bakery only- so no booze but none needed.  Very bright clean French  cafe like decor; friendly staff.  Great place! [REVIEW_16] We hired Minuteman to re-key our new home as well as add deadbolts as needed.  They were prompt; courteous; and friendly.  We will definitely use Minuteman in the future. (Meridian; ID) [REVIEW_17] Great little hotel. Very helpful staff from front desk to valet to GREAT service in restaurant @ breakfast and dinner. Lovely art work everywhere. Comfortable beds. Recommend highly. [REVIEW_18] Great local bar! I love the portobello sandwich. It's marinated in balsamic too. So yummy! The Hoppy Ass beer is a great IPA at an unbelievable price. Great place to meet with friends for food and drinks. It is also kid friendly. The also have a chess game if you want to play with your friend while enjoying a cold beer! [REVIEW_19] This is the best BBQ place in these parts! The sandwiches; the brisket and the ribs are amazing! Side are so good; beans and corn bread you can not go wrong. The special sandwich of brisket; smoked pork and smoked turkey with smoked cheese on top might be the best sando in Alberta! [REVIEW_20] On a recent trip to TN for a ""best friends"" reunion we decided; pretty spontaneously; to get matching tattoos celebrating our 15 year friendship! We didn't have any expectations about being able to get into a tattoo parlour especially one with the reputation of Black 13! However; Black 13 even though fully booked; went out of their way to accommodate us knowing 3 of us had to return to CT! In addition to cleanliness; the staff was VERY polite and Ryan did EXACTLY what we wanted! I would highly recommend Black 13 and I definitely plan to return next time I'm in the area!!!!!!!!!",17
84,"[REVIEW_1] OK; so we never actually got our food... Or our menus for that matter; which was very disappointing. Staff was rude and the dining room looked like a dive.  I heard such good things about this place and since we were checking out a band next door last night; we thought we'd go in and try this local soul food restaurant people have been raving about.  I went in with a small group of four. We stood by the door waiting to be seated for a good 5 minutes. But no staff was in sight. So we thought maybe this is one of those establishments where you seat yourself... So we did.  We sat close to the front and waited. Finally; a waiter came into the room. He looked right at us and kept walking - OK; guess we're not at his station. We waited again. Another waiter came in; she acknowledged us; but never came over. A third waiter came in - we must have been seated for 15 minutes at this point and still no service has come to the table -- not even to give us a ""I'll be right back"" explanation - he apparently wasn't our waiter either.  At this time another couple walked in - it looked like they were deciding whether they liked the place (it has a ""dive restaurant"" feel to it). One waiter sees the couple and points to a table for them to sit at. The couple still talking amongst themselves did not see the waiter signaling (why didn't he just walk up to them? Makes no sense). The waiter says; very loudly and rudely with an annoyed tone and expression; ""heeelllloooo!"" When they heard that; they left... And so did we because still; nobody had came to our table and we didn't want to miss our band because of some sub-par waiters who were struggling to handle a half empty dining room.   Too bad. Heard the food was good.  We ended up going to a place down the block( it was right next to d.b.a.)  the food was awesome; staff friendly; they had live music and we only ended up  spending about $150 for 4. [REVIEW_2] My bad... I was in the Crescent City last March and took this tour and forgot to leave a review!!  I've been on quite a few walking tours in the city and this is THE BEST one I've ever taken.  It encompasses way more than the other ones offered. You won't regret taking this one as you get it all along with getting to follow the history of the Duparc-Locoul family. [REVIEW_3] This restaurant is one of NewOrleans best kept secrets!  Very authentic & fresh. Service is prompt; menu questions clearly explained ; portions are generous.  Very reasonably priced.  Great for families also. No bar ; but a large variety of sodas as well as ice cream in a store type freezer with sliding glass top . I felt as if I was visiting Mexico again. Highly recommend this restaurant.  I didn't ask if it is a byo place. [REVIEW_4] Did not like this hotel at all. Me and my husband stayed there one night after getting off our honeymoon cruise out of New Orleans. While still on the boat I called the hotel to let them know that we would only be staying one of the two nights we reserved due to some issues with our home in Houston. We had to leave early to address them in person. I communicated that with the manager who stated that he would call me back because he was dealing with another customer. Never received a callback. We checked in Saturday March 5 at 1600. We left the next day Sunday March 6 at 1130. As we checked out I told the manager it was an early checkout and he said that I would have to talk to the third party vendor (booking.com) to not be charged. I was okay with that.  Fast forward to today. Called booking.com and the customer associate stated that the manager charged me for the second night that I never used as a penalty for not warning them of our ealy check out. He lied. I spoke to him at least twice about us leaving. DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU ARE OUT OF TOWN. VERY UNCLEAN AND DISGUSTING and the management is sketchy. Take your money and go somewhere nicer. [REVIEW_5] I just ordered a keg for my daughters first birthday party. How easy was this you ask.... Way to easy and at a great value!!!! A 1/2 keg gives about 160 12oz drinks! At $150 ( Heineken) that's $1 a beer!!!!!  You can rent the keg for as long as you need.  But the beer begins to degrade after a day or 2 if you don't have a kegerartor. But I'm pretty sure a few keg stands will solve the problem of any left overs.  Not only do they provide a keg with a large list of beers for your to order.  You can ask to rent a tub ( to keep it cold) and the pump.  There are deposits for these items. But will get it back once returned.  Really makes me want to look into buying a kegerartor now. I would totally keep a keg next to bed.   Not only can you choose from a great selection of beers. There are also different size kegs you could order depending on your needs.  Love this great service.  Thank you for keeping Tampa slightly tipsy total wine. Life and spirits go great together! [REVIEW_6] I am a college student who tried yoga once or twice but never enjoyed it until I went to the yoga room. All the teachers are awesome but I took classes with Jamie and they were the best yoga classes I have ever taken. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new yoga studio in the Clearwater/tampa area. [REVIEW_7] Excellent food and service. Our waiter suggested the shrimp and grits. So happy he did. The best shrimp and grits I've had. Soup of the day was delicious; and the dessert sampler was really decadent. The new location is great. [REVIEW_8] Great restaurant with fresh and delicious Mexican food and great drinks. Would recommend for weeknight dinners or just a general craving for really good Mexican! [REVIEW_9] I had been stalking food trucks for some time; when I finally landed somewhere that had five all together. Most were selling sample size items for a small prize. At WCTT; you got three tacos for the same prize. Loved; loved; loved them! Served on corn tortillas with meat perfectly cooked; you couldn't ask for more! And friendly service; to boot. If you see this truck in your area; high tail it over there! [REVIEW_10] This is a great place to spend the afternoon walking around and going through all the stores; I really like the shuttle services they have; as well as the firepits. [REVIEW_11] Stayed here with the family for six nights on a trip to the Big Easy. A beautiful and charming place to stay. The staff from the doorman to the wait staff for brunch were  friendly and helpful.  The Carousel Bar is a must.   Great location; will be going back there for sure next time we are in New Orleans. [REVIEW_12] Bad experience in every way! Kept me waiting for no apparent reason; wasn't nice at all and did a terrible job on my brows. Aside from feeling scalped I am also uneven. All this for top dollar. Never again. [REVIEW_13] Yum.  I love to swing by Smiley's on my way home from work and pick up a vegetarian falafel platter. Their falafel is perfection! Far; far better than Couch Tomato (no surprise there since this is a Mediterranean joint). Prices are fair; food is super fresh. Their hummus is silky with just a hint of lemon. Yes; carryout can take a little while but everything is made to order so I'm happy to wait or just call ahead. Do not miss this great little place!! [REVIEW_14] These people must know what they are doing... after only being open for 2 days the staff was on their game; the atmosphere was magical and the food was the best vegan cuisine I have ever had.  As a vegan I have been dreaming of a place like this coming to the area.  It tastes like they have a true chef designing and executing exciting; healthy meals.  They aren't just another vegan restaurant trying to imitate familiar foods.  This is true fine dining.  We brought friends who are not vegan or vegetarian and they really enjoyed their meals.  The chef even agreed to some special meal requests for our children.     I can't wait to go back so we can try more of the menu.  I recommend making reservation for a patio table so you can enjoy the beautiful outdoor atmosphere they have created.  There is outdoor heating so no worries about it being too cold. [REVIEW_15] Horrible food; undercooked sushi rice; pretty much bad everything. Don't waste your time or money [REVIEW_16] Great new spot for us locals to get off of Beach Drive!  Creative menu and and fresh makeover looks hip and fresh.  I had short ribs and truffle fries; I could be mistaken but I believe I had some duck as well; not bad for a girl who doesn't like meat. I couldn't get enough:) Thumbs up to them; the bar is small but you can sit indoors or outdoors [REVIEW_17] What miserable customer service.   We went here as part of a special event for families of autistic children. While I commend the owners for reaching out to people with special needs; the way they handle themselves behind the counter is sickening.   When we got there we found out that the entire inside of the park was closed; something that was not mentioned anywhere in their press release (not on their own website either; despite their insistence that it was). So all the autistic kids were confined to a wave pool and two smaller areas; which was far from adequate for this particular crowd.  When I complained to the manager Dan; he was clearly overwhelmed by the situation and had no answers to give regarding why it was never stated that most of the facility was off limits. But at least he was polite; unlike Brandon.   Brandon; another assistant manager; interjected himself unasked in our conversation and interrupted me at every sentence. I guess if the customer can't finish a sentence it doesn't count as a complaint. Even when I asked him to let me speak he kept talking over me. Great managerial technique there.   He offered to refund our tickets but only if we left right then. While we had no problem leaving; there were a lot of families whose children took a lot effort to move either because of physical or developmental disabilities. Had either of them offered refunds at our leisure as a sign of good faith; we would have stayed and spent more than the cost of the tickets on the insanely over priced food ($12 for a basket of chicken fingers is utterly ridiculous); plus guaranteed our return another time. As it is they've lost our business permanently.   If you choose to go here; I hope you have fun. Just don't go expecting resolutions to any problems you might have; because apparently they don't know the first thing about customer service. [REVIEW_18] Dr. Malisan and the entire staff here are amazing! I never needed glasses until a few months ago; and when I decided to get contacts I chose to go here because of the great reviews. Dr. Biscardi was all booked so I went to Dr. Malisan instead and she was incredible. It exceeded my expectations; which were already very high from reading Yelp. The entire staff--from the receptionists to the technicians to the doctors--are exceedingly courteous; patient; and helpful. Don't go anywhere else; I know I wont. [REVIEW_19] I found this park through reviews on facebook - where they report glowingly that it looks ""like something out of Hobbiton in Lord of the Rings; or Alice in Wonderland."" I agree- it looks beautifullly maintained with small baby waterfalls as the creek meanders its way down the Valley.   The walking path is paved and flat; so it is not challenging / is safe for seniors. I would guess the entire oval-shaped loop would be around 3/4 of a mile - it was a lovely slow 20 minute walk.   It appeared sparsely populated but I passed two families with strollers and a group of seniors. Big parking lot; off Campbell Road on the North side of the park. A hidden gem; but if you are around and up for a quiet walk through a beautiful garden; come by! Its free! [REVIEW_20] A few years ago I bit into my roasted peppers AND a fish hook. The staff could not have cared less; pretty much insinuating I brought the hook with me to put in their food. They didn't even take the dish off the check; even though I wouldn't eat it or anything else after nearly having my gums impaled. I'll never go back & have advised others to stay away. Not even an apology. I should say there was a lot of blood & they couldn't wait to get me out of there (after paying the full bill). Rude does not even begin to describe that staff.",14
85,"[REVIEW_1] Our nice little neighborhood park. Welcome to the nice part of west Philly aka Cedar park. With rich old school architecture that is maintained and the ability to walk around feeling safe. In the summer stick around to watch some fire twirlers and partake in the small music festival. [REVIEW_2] Selfishly I don't want to write about how wonderful the Pacific Crest Hotel was!  Selfishly; I'm afraid that the rest of the world will experience a stay at the Pacific Crest Hotel thus making it harder for me to stay on my next trip to Santa Barbara!  This place is not only one block from the beach (and you can see the ocean from the hotel) but also close to State Street and everything else you hope to visit in Santa Barbara.    The rooms felt homey; clean; and made us feel like we were staying in someone's home.  Though it is a hotel it didn't feel like it!  The owners; Jennifer and Greg are always on property; great to talk with; and have suggestions about SB!  Jennifer provides a homemade breakfast each morning!  Oatmeal; omelette ""bars""; coffee cakes; fruits and other morning treats were provided each morning.    Loved our visit and can't wait to come back and stay at the Pacific Crest. [REVIEW_3] I loved this place; it was my first time coming here with my friend and we both loved the service and how our manicures came out. They made us feel welcome and taken care of. I really enjoyed it and we will definitely come back. We did make an appointment at around 1pm on a Saturday and there was only one other customer in there with us. [REVIEW_4] I thought about writing something witty and entertaining but then I read what Scott S. wrote and his review was such a slam dunk; I figure why bother?   My one word contribution: Amazeballs. [REVIEW_5] This small quaint place is a gem! I found this restaurant on Groupon. The food was delicious. I really enjoyed the calm atmosphere; music and art on the walls. The customer service was excellent. The food was flavorful! [REVIEW_6] Super amazing homemade food. They renew the interior and kitchen and it's looks great! Honestly hands down best Mexican in philly. Tamalex is good BUT this place is another story. Top Mexican by far. Only downside is cash only. Enjoy. [REVIEW_7] Here visiting and looking for a good breakfast place! This place is so cute it's hidden so not so easy to find unless you know but once you do you'll be happy you found it! They have all organic foods and Turkish coffee which was cool to try and was good. I also got the sunset smoothie which was very good and the silver dollar pancakes with eggs. Everything was good and service was good! Would def recommend! [REVIEW_8] I got my ears and my eyebrow pierced here and I had a great experience both times. I highly recommend . I will be back. [REVIEW_9] Have been here many times and always had a great experience. When we moved to Rita Ranch 6 months ago my husband and I did a lot of rehab work on our new house and would go almost once a week to recover from the week's ""work-out"". It's always clean; they never gyp you on time; take the time to work on problem areas. Felicia is the best. Highly recommend them!   Update...neck really bothering me so I went in and had the best therapeutic massage with Felicia. It was amazing! She is truly talented. [REVIEW_10] The service was great; the server was pleasant and refilled our drinks frequently. Any good southerner knows keeping that sweet tea coming is a must on a warm summer day! The sampler platter was a great way to see the flavors of the chef's special dishes. It comes with gumbo; étouffée; and jambalaya pasta. The chicken piccata was good as well. The desserts looked great but we were too full to eat them. Next time I'll have to save room though. [REVIEW_11] Time flew by; You won't regret it! She did an awesome job! She will work with you to make them look natural. Call to make an appointment she's always book up. [REVIEW_12] I've always heard great things about their groothie so I tried it. It was giving me a smoothie-gasm. Love it. But then one time it was served room-temperature and it was awkward...which was off putting to me because I don't really like warm smoothies; though other people may not mind. Personally; I think I pay good money for this; so it bothered me. I came back another day for another try; and I realized I fell in love with the groothie when it's chilled. I've yet to try their other goods! I like the vibe of the place itself though. Lots of positivity :) [REVIEW_13] This vet is the best! I took my 5 month old puppy in to get spayed. They could not have been more kind; from the receptionist to the doctor. And they brushed her out and clipped her nails while she was out! I'm a very worrisome doggy mom and I felt very confident leaving Doris in their care. She healed up beautifully and we had no troubles at all. Highly recommend this vet [REVIEW_14] Here during MLK weekend 2015.  Clean room; good location; free wifi; comfy bed; and a quick breakfast is what you should expect.   Staff members are friendly.  Rooms are very nice.  Be sure to walk to the beach; marina; or state st.  Parking is convenient.   We borrowed a pack and play for our son during our stay.  Very convenient!   I would recommend they provide a flat sheet for the bottom to be folded around it.  We brought our own sheet but it would be nice if there were already one on it.    Will definitely be back.  Thanks so much! [REVIEW_15] Having grown up in the south I equate fried food with comfort. I live in California where it isn't inextricably woven as in my heart. Zydeco filled me up with great food and did my heart good as well.  The catfish was the most tender and succulent that I've had in memory.  The shrimp and oysters were flash fried to perfection. The okra was crunchy and perfectly salted!  Go? [REVIEW_16] One of our favorite Mexican places in the area. It's close by and very reasonably priced. We especially love the guacamole; fajitas; tacos; orchata; and chimichangas. Everything is authentic; fresh; and tastes delicious. Though it's not a fancy dining room; it is clean and spacious. Check it out; you won't be disappointed. [REVIEW_17] this place is amazing.  i don't get cravings for italian food a lot; but MAN! their meatball sub is heaven... like i want one now... right now... not kidding...  their food is always so fresh and you can taste it. at first i saw their portions and was all ""this is not enough to be called italian"" but half way through you're waving the white flag... but then the food is so nommy you just don't want to stop. and you finally do when you've used the last of their amazing bread to lap up the last drops of sauce... THAT'S ITALIAN!  i never make it to gelato; but the one time i tried some from a friend he ordered ""chocolate covered bacon"" and the base flavor was smooth and delicious; the chocolate covered bacon part started off good... tasted like toffee... then this hickory smoked flavor comes in from left field... needless to say... i'll be getting my own flavors [REVIEW_18] Evething about This Resturant is great! 1- brew there own soy sauce 2 service amazing  3- food fresh; creative & amazingly good 4- everything about this small south jersey Resturant is the best around. 5- can not wait to return!! [REVIEW_19] It was the first time of me being at a Korean BBQ place. We got both the hot pot and BBQ. It was like a buffet style; we got unlimited amount of food. The food was good; they had a lot of options. There was also a salad bar and a sauce bar. Would go back again. [REVIEW_20] This is my very first review.  I figured reviewing Village Whiskey would kick me off to a good start.    My wife and I arrived at 8:00pm and was told there was a 2 hour wait.  I read reviews prior to arriving so I was prepared to wait.  I was still a little surprised at how small this place is.  We decided to wait around by the bar.  After waiting for roughly 25 minutes; a spot opened up at a sit down counter; adjacent to the bar.    For starters; we ordered the pickled red and golden beets along with turnips and black kale from their pickled section.  We liked the pickled beets but the turnips and black kale surprisingly where our favorite.  The acidity was mild and the black kale was crisp.  The toppings I ordered on my burger were Rogue Smokey Bleu; caramelized onions; bacon; and a fried egg.  I had high expectations for my burger and I was not disappointed.  It was cooked to perfection.  I wish I knew what grinds of meet they used to create their burgers because they had the right amount of fat to keep them moist and where full of flavor.  I was underwhelmed with the duck fat French fries.  They were okay; but nothing exceptional to me. The S'more milk shake was excellent!  The homemade marshmallow had all the characteristics and nuances of their camp fire cousins.    I woke up the next day; thinking about the burger I consumed the night before at the Village Whiskey.  Hands down; this is ONE of the best burgers I have eaten!",20
86,"[REVIEW_1] Finally went in after walking by so many times. Glad we did. Small place but IR is pleasing to the eye. One wall cover with wood palates and subtle two tone gray walls. Started with the prosciutto fig arugula Parmesan flatbread appetites. Enough for two people and delicious. Nice mix of flavors. Main dishes were a burger grass fed beef with fries coated with truffles dusting. Burger was humongous!  Looked good smelled good and tasted good. I had a seafood soup with fish ( not sure what it was) shrimp and mollusks in a  coconut/ curry broth. Deliciously spicy but not enough to kill your taste buds. Overall I would recommend this place. We went early as we heard it gets crowded and they do not take reservations.  BYW great wine and craft beer selections [REVIEW_2] This small little donut bakery is located in one of Hermitage's oldest shopping centers!   I can imagine baking donuts is a hard job; let alone running the business...it's one of those jobs that starts in the wee hours of the morning so that the donuts are freshly made daily!  Yeu; the owner; serves not only your common popular donuts; but he also serves donuts with bacon on top; apple fritters; pigs in a blanket; breakfast pastries; and  kolaches....in addition to these yummy treats...he makes doughssants....they are what seems to be a scandalous marriage of a donut and a croissant...!!!!!!!! Need I say more? Yeah...you heard me. A doughssant! Worth the trip just to eat one of these!   Prices are considerably cheap! The doughssants are only $1.99 each! The regular donuts are about $.60 each!   These sweet donuts are my favorite treats to buy for my kid's school teachers...and they love them!   Coffee also served here! [REVIEW_3] So I was starving  and craving tacos ; I walk in and nobody was there just the workers . I ordered ; paid for it and went home . Those were the worst tacos of my life; this is sad day. My stomach still hurts from the pain I felt and the disappointment. It's sad that  workers today have no pride in what they make . I love tacos so much; I will not return [REVIEW_4] By far the WORST Taco Bell ever.  First problem was we found hair in our food and it turns out to be one of the rude supervisors and refused to even help us out and denied us our money back so the general manager who was awesome helped us out and refunded us. Then all of a sudden tonight after months of not going back to this we decided to and we specifically asked for our nacho cheese that's comes on the burrito to just put it on the side like all the other t bells do we never got charged for it and my boyfriend is deathly allergic to it and for a soft taco instead of hard shell. Of course it was all wrong cheese everywhere charged for the nacho cheese no soft taco and the young lady who took our order tried to argue with us saying ""you didn't say that"" last time I checked the customer is always right. Working in the food industry i know good service when i see it and she didnt have any of it. Her voice; attitude; body language all wrong. The manager at the time accommodated us. He was polite and so nice. But the young employee however was horrible and shouldn't be even interacting with people. Pathetic attitude; laughing as she got our order wrong and horrible service all around and nothing done about it no apology...nothing. This taco bell just needs new employees and people who actually pay attention to what's going on instead of goofing off. [REVIEW_5] I'm not sure why I'm writing this since you can just look at every other review written for this place and get the exact same story.   My wife was literally grabbed; like actually literally grabbed; by the face the second she stepped in the door. The culprit was a big-tittied shot girl that proceeded to dump a bunch of piss water down her throat. Then I was informed I owed her $24. When I refused to pay I was told the police were being called. My wife; not wanting to spend our trip coming to pick me up at the police station; (which is where I gladly would have gone rather than give a penny to these shady-ass MFers); swiped my wallet from my pocket and paid the bill.   Everybody there from the door guys to the managers to the bathroom attendants are the worst; most sketchy people on Bourbon Street. If you gave this place a five-star review please do humanity a favor and shoot yourself in the face. [REVIEW_6] Food was great. But very disappointed with the hospitality. We  entered the restaurant at 9:15 pm but was denied dine in and was told that though the  restaurant closes at 10 pm they won't let us dine in and can give only to go. They saw that there were two pregnant women and a kid with us and I explained that our home is a hour drive from there and yet they denied for no reason. I had to drive back to home and make everyone eat. Very disappointed with such attitude towards customers. Never going back here. Let them try to forgive them self for denying dining for pregnant women. [REVIEW_7] The beignets were so bad that we didn't even eat them. They tasted like fried shrimp and were tough as well. The pralines were gritty; but tasty. Also; the computer/register was down so no drinks available from the bar. We offered to pay cash; but this was beyond their capacity and the request was met with silence. The courtyard was lovely though and the staff courteous. But it was such a disappointment on our first stop of our first day to New Orleans. [REVIEW_8] Gave them another try today ... SMDH .... how does this place stay open .... customer service non existent always out of something or something not working ... really don't know how they even stay open .. I would be embarrassed to own this location [REVIEW_9] I've grown up in a Lebanese family and we owned a middle eastern restaurant for over 40 years. The food is everything to me. Their food and pleasentries makes me feel like I'm at my family's table. The smells bring me to sito's (grandmother's) kitchens.  This place is a must for truly authentic food and feel of middle eastern culture.   I've tried a few in Philly; none compare. [REVIEW_10] Sat in the drive thru for 15 minutes; finally got to order; and the employee couldn't get our order right. He then has the nerve to yell at me through the speaker and tell me ""I'm busy doing 6 things at once; hold on!"" I have never felt so disrespected at a fast food joint. I immediately leave the drive thru to go in and let the manager on duty know how rude his employee was; and so we could finally order our food. (Let me remind you by this point we had been here 20 minutes and still haven't even ordered!) I talked with the manager; order our food; and it still took another 20 minutes to get it. I work in a restaurant; i know that it isn't as easy as people think. They weren't understaffed; they weren't busy; and that is why i am appalled at the lack of customer service and execution! 45 minutes for food and terrible customer service... Will not be coming back! [REVIEW_11] I absolutely love this place and think is easily the best burrito shop in town. Great salsas; relaxed atmosphere; excellent service and price;  Most importantly the burritos are delicious. The chicken and chorizo combo is  my personal favorite but the smoked brisket is great as well. The medium burrito is plenty unless you are training for an eating event.  Family owned; not a chain and it shows in the attention to flavor. Highest recommendation if you are interested in good; healthy food (unless you eat yourself into oblivion) at a reasonable price. [REVIEW_12] After joining Yelp and reading the reviews for Lilly Nails; as well as reviewing their Facebook page;  I eagerly went for a pedicure and a mani polish change. Unfortunately; I was beyond disappointed as I was looking forward to quality work and an above average experience based on what I interpteted was a place that takes pride in their work.  The technician seemed annoyed when I asked to have the water a bit hotter.  I got the deluxe pedicure which I asked about prior to getting to ensure that more time would be spent on callus removal; however she spent about 30 seconds pumicing one foot and less than 20 seconds on the other foot missing a whole area on the bottom of my second foot.  She rushed the service and my pedicure and polish change together were at most 40 minutes.  When I go for a pedicure; particularly if I pay extra for what is considered a ""deluxe"" service; I expect the work and the experience as a whole to be above average.  Unfortunately; Lilly Nails did not even come close to meeting my expectations. [REVIEW_13] This is my second bad experience in a row at Stefano's. Tonight; I waited over 45 minutes for a call-in order they said would take 15 minutes. Then they were out of Greek dressing and told me they'd ""been out for a while"" - how does a Greek Italian restaurant run out of Greek dressing? [REVIEW_14] I'm very displeased with my experience here the girl up front was very rude when I went up to the bar to get some drinks I was not carded when my friends who are african American went up right after me they were carded which they were already carded up front so I don't understand why they were carded twice and I was only once I think that was very racist of them the workers there just make you feel uncomfortable for being there i had such high hopes for this place I am so let down I will not be returning [REVIEW_15] Chef Shawney Severns is a creative genius with her weekly specials. The staff are wonderful; caring; efficient and friendly. Love this place. [REVIEW_16] You'll definitely have a wait for brunch but grab a drink and buckle in cause it's worth it. Everyone at the table loved what they ordered. We started with the buffalo cauliflower and got the pretzel pancakes; nooner; blueberry waffle and the red velvet waffle and damn if we didn't clean our plates. Also if you don't get the white trash hash you'll regret it for years to come. Service was great and our drinks were perfect. [REVIEW_17] This review incident dates back to 2009 but I still truly feel ""hot under the collar"" about my used car experience with Sherwood Kia.  I bought a 2002 Sunfire; cash; off the lot. The salesman was pushy; rude; and very ignorant. Upon the test drive the car was was hesitating as I was shifting gears and he said that they would look at the problem before I left the lot if I bought the car. I paid $3000 for it and needless to say....what a piece of *%#@! Everything that was checked off their ""maintenance report"" saying was in good condition had to be replaced within the first week I had the car as I took it to a reputable mechanic.  SO....7 days; I asked for my money back!!! I got the run around so bad that I eventually wrote a letter to the owner (AFTER NO ONE WAS RETURNING MY CALLS) and the Used Car dept. manager (whoever) called me after another 2 weeks and asked me to come in. I went in there asked for the manager and then I stood in the dealership for 30-minutes before he came up to me. Well....we got into a yelling match in the parking lot after I was in tears and yelling inside and threatened to call the BBB; tell everyone of FB; and whoever else would listen that...get this...(his exact words)...""We DO NOT guarantee quality used vehicles""!!!! I'm not kidding! I never got my money back and I REFUSE to ever do business there again!!!! [REVIEW_18] My husband and I went here right before they were closing because we were in the neighborhood and needed some items for a recipe we were planning to make the next day.  I was super disappointed in this food outlet.  The meat section looked AWFUL; most of the meat was turning brown and the whole back of the store smelled like rotten food.  Like I said; it was around closing time; but it totally turned me off and gave me a ""gut feeling"" that I shouldn't buy anything from this store.  The layout was also a bit unorganized.  I will not be back. [REVIEW_19] I just finished my very rushed;very awful experience at Ed's Rec Room. They have recently decided to charge bowling by time; and not by game. This has taken away all of the fun and relaxation from the game; and added an element of annoyance and panic. Also; your time begins to countdown the second you pay for it; leaving you rushing to put on your shoes and put your groups names into the system. And heaven forbid you need to take a bathroom break; or need a beverage! You don't get to PAUSE your time for ANYTHING. They didn't even have a server; so if you're hoping to have a couple beers; better get ready to run quick and get them yourself. The lane even malfunctioned a couple times; but there's no time to wait for a service worker to fix it; because they don't bother extending the time you've lost. I would have rather paid a few extra bucks a game than been forced to play a speedy game to get my monies worth. Extremely unimpressed; and will not be returning until they fix their rates. [REVIEW_20] I was sort of unsure how to rate this place. I had a similar experience to Sara P.  I joined in October. Got a GREAT workout. It was really enjoyable and definitely challenging. In December; emails about fraud; theft; employees leaving started coming.  My husband and I had purchased; but didn't get to use yet; 10 classes each for $85.  The new owners wouldn't recognize the 10 classes; but we can each have $85 credit. I was told we had till the end of Feb to covert the credit to classes but the owner said I may want to wait; as she offers specials in February.  I email this week about a deal they have for 5 classes for $47. I get an email back that I can't use the credits for special deals.  What??? I just want to use my credits; and walk away. It doesn't seem to me that this place is fixed at all. There are plenty of places in Philadelphia where I can work out and not have to worry about all this drama. The workout is a 4-5 star. The ethics is a 1.",6
87,"[REVIEW_1] I went to Vegetate twice; and I will never go again. I went once on a Tuesday and got excited about the food prospects and wanted to try it all. I had a pita with tempura fried quinoa that was good; but dry without any tzatziki. I also had the green beans which were way too oily and I couldn't finish them.    The next day I went back in for food again and realized virtually nothing in the window had changed except there was less vegetable lasagna. This really concerned me as it was now 11:50 am and I didn't think a lot of people would have eaten it already. I then realized that probably none of this stuff was cooked very fresh and it was oily as a way to preserve it.   I got the vietnamese tofu sandwich with whole grain. They nuked it in a microwave and I had to wait five minutes for it to cool down. The bread was really dry and hard and flavorless. The tofu had no remarkable flavor; and the carrots were seemingly doused with chili to make the flavor of the whole thing. I couldn't eat the sandwich and ended up eating the tofu out of it and going to Joe for a croissant after to be full enough to wait for dinner.  The employee there was really not wanting to help in any way shape or form. She looked at me annoyed when I asked for a cup of water.  I paid cash which she looked at me annoying because she didn't get to just swipe a card and then when I had change of 1.09 she used one hand and slowly took out nine pennies using one hand acting like she couldn't even use the other hand because she didn't want to wash it again to go back to preparing food. When I asked if I could instead have a nickel and four pennies; she just looked at me and said ""no.""  This was pretty ridiculous as the register had about 15 nickels in it and she just didn't want to be helpful.  I won't go back. There's Magic Carpet for vegetarian food at 34th and Walnut. I'll go there if I ever want something; they're cheaper; nicer and fresher. This place should close and be replaced with some place that wants to give fresher food and better customer service. [REVIEW_2] After reading many positive reviews me and my wife decided to book two nights here to celebrate new years 2015. The room was not bad but nowhere near $179 a night. Allow me to explain. For starters the breakfast that was included in the price was pathetic. The eggs were powered; all of the food that was supposed to be hot wasn't even warm. The staff had a hard time keeping fresh silverware stocked and what little food they offered. This breakfast is not worth spending the extra money in booking this hotel. The shuttle service left us at bush gardens new years eve because they claim we didn't make reservations to and from because there shuttle bus could only hold 8 people. We went to the front desk and watched them put our name and room number on the schedule and they still were able to screw that up. I had to call the hotel at 12:20 a.m. 01--1-2015 and spoke with one of the managers about our situation being stranded after making reservations and she wasn't even apologetic. She told me to get a cab and the hotel would reimburse me. I explained to her there were no cabs in sight and she claimed there was nothing she could do. We had to walk to the hotel 1/2 mile away on new years; thanks hyatt..  Our bathroom was so small you couldn't even close the door without having to step into the shower. Also at 3:30 a.m. there is a very loud train that comes through and blows a very loud horn that alarmed everyone we spoke with staying at the hotel. After this experience we will Never book anything with hyatt because it was very disappointing after spending $400 for 2 nights to receive this kind of service... One has to wonder with all of the positive reviews why there were no negative reviews because most places have them regardless.. Save yourself a headache and book elsewhere... [REVIEW_3] Great place. Needed to get out so went here and it was the right kind of relaxation i needed [REVIEW_4] Wasn't impressed. My friend got a terrible tattoo there.Maybe that's why its so far away from town.vape and tattoo? I hear vaping is not allowed in tattoo shops. Hack artists trying to pretend tattoo. [REVIEW_5] Bad experience!!  There was a large  loud party in the bar when we arrived.  We were told they would leave in 15 min. but they did not leave for 75 min.  If told the truth; we would not have stayed.  Only choices were to yell at your companion or not communicate.  Chosen wine not available and not offered another selection at the same price.  When we complained to the staff about the service and the noise; we were  made to feel like it was our fault and offered no sympathy or compensation.  The good food was ruined by the abysmal service and the noise. [REVIEW_6] Bought my tires at Sears and got the warranty package for road hazard. Have brought my car in for low tire pressure six times since July. Each time they suggest an alignment; which I had done in July! It's been the same two tires I keep telling them that are low on air and to look to see if they have leaks. 4 times all they did is reset the TPMS system. I acquired a copy of the hand written notes! They did NOT fix the issues with the tires. In mid September; I was on my way to work when one of the two tires had a blow out. Brought it back to have them  fix the tire issues. I had to watch them the entire time to make sure they did the work. Before I was ready to leave they said I needed an alignment! Must be a money maker for them! I told them I had one in July. They did it complimentary and when I got the results; there was NOTHING wrong with the alignment! I waged a complaint to their corporate office. I was told the district manager will be calling me; that hasn't happened yet!!!  Back again for the left front tire today! Guess what? They say I need an alignment! NOT!  DO NOT BUY TIRES FROM THEM NO MATTER WHAT!  Spend the savings at a more reputable establishment! [REVIEW_7] Had a grilled chicken sandwich on bun to go. Couldn't hold sandwich due to bottom bun being soggy.  So I decided to just eat the meat.  I saw a piece of hair as I removed the meat. I haven't ate there in years and will not eat there again.  Zero stars from me. [REVIEW_8] Came here for lunch on the last day of our trip to New Orleans. It was amazing. I had the gumbo and the gulf white shrimp and cucuzza stew. The perfect way to end the trip because I really wanted to take in New Orleans' cuisine and this was just the restaurant to do it. [REVIEW_9] Probably my least favorite thing I did in New Orleans. It was a boring boat tour with a guide that had the strangest accent. It felt like he was slurring through the entire two hour tour. Not very interesting insights either and it was so freaking hot on the boat I was just trying not to pass out from the heat and humidity. They stuff these boats to the brim and it's a total tourist trap. The water is brown and there is little to see. Much better off doing a swamp tour so you can at least see alligators and birds.  The one positive is they don't charge an arm and a leg for cold drinks which are an absolute must on this tour if you must go. So many other fun things to enjoy; I'd skip this one if I were you. [REVIEW_10] Great donuts; great atmosphere.  Very good service.  The variety is fun and ever-changing.  Never made it for the sliders or brew; but maybe next time....  They do a really nice job of utilizing social media too.... [REVIEW_11] Love this bar! Great food; drinks; and live music. Jess and Nicole rock it outvas bartenders. Great locals hangout. [REVIEW_12] Went here to redeem Groupon; frist time staff member said she couldn't use system and for me to come back after she extended it. I went back and I was told I was out of luck it expired.  Way to waste my time and very un-Yoga like. I will stick with Wake up Yoga and PSC; they know how to treat people. [REVIEW_13] Paid for Deluxe Services almost 2 months prior to the event and only received a basic package at best. Attempts to resolve the issue with Keith have been returned with defensive dialogue; accusatory statements and untruths. His unprofessional approach has escalated this situation to the point of being settled in court. I have never been treated so poorly by a vendor. [REVIEW_14] Pretty average take-out chinese. Not bad; not the best; but id definitely eat there again. ***update--- just ate there again and they got our complex delivery perfect and the food was excellent! 5 stars now!! [REVIEW_15] I was sort of unsure how to rate this place. I had a similar experience to Sara P.  I joined in October. Got a GREAT workout. It was really enjoyable and definitely challenging. In December; emails about fraud; theft; employees leaving started coming.  My husband and I had purchased; but didn't get to use yet; 10 classes each for $85.  The new owners wouldn't recognize the 10 classes; but we can each have $85 credit. I was told we had till the end of Feb to covert the credit to classes but the owner said I may want to wait; as she offers specials in February.  I email this week about a deal they have for 5 classes for $47. I get an email back that I can't use the credits for special deals.  What??? I just want to use my credits; and walk away. It doesn't seem to me that this place is fixed at all. There are plenty of places in Philadelphia where I can work out and not have to worry about all this drama. The workout is a 4-5 star. The ethics is a 1. [REVIEW_16] Our food was delicious!! The brussel sprouts appetizer was to die for. We also shared the crawfish bisque and the shrimp and grits; which were both delicious as well. I would recommend both!! We made a reservation; which I would recommend doing as well. The service was very friendly; polite; and helpful. I only wish we had more money to spend on food! [REVIEW_17] I can't believe I have to give a star.  Quick rundown.  I ordered: single with no ketchup; mayo; or mustard with med fried and large unsweetened teas double with everything lg fries large coke 2 5 piece nuggets side salad cheeseburger kids meal plain with oranges and vanilla frosty. Ok now for what I GOT: double with bacon; no ketchup mayo or mustard; lg fries; coke single with everything; lg fries coke hamburger kids meal with fries and coke right around the time I said no ketchup a blank look came across the face of the employee. This is not rocket science. [REVIEW_18] We walked in with every intention to spend a good amount of money on souvenirs. My husband gave me a kiss in the store and she kicked us out and told us it is a place of business and we need a hotel. Meanwhile she was eating her lunch  at the register and chomping away and didn't even great us. Yikes. Hope they reconsider their tactics. [REVIEW_19] This has quickly become one of my favorite places to eat! My friend and I have been here twice already and I've never left feeling disappointed. I recommend just about everything they have on the raw list and then on the medium plates the mama dumplings are a must! What also makes this place great in my book is that the service is amazing. [REVIEW_20] This hotel is a hidden gem in the desert! Clean rooms; cozy ambience and excellent customer service. Free cookies; free breakfast and free use of the business center. Highly recommend",8
88,"[REVIEW_1] Best tacos in Tucson hands down. If i want tacos i must go here. They just opened another location in the park place mall and i love it! Worth the money [REVIEW_2] The Disc Golf course here is one of the nicest you will ever see. Professional satellite view type tee signs; benches; and bag posts at every hole. Multiple pin locations ensure your round will likely be different every weekend (or at least change monthly) water come in to play on several holes; and every hole is wooded.  The Taylor Park Disc Golf Club; the ""Sand Slugs"" keep the course current and updated. Come out and play a round... If you've never played... find a club member on the course- I bet they would let you jump in and let you borrow a disc for a round! [REVIEW_3] The Eggs benny were slamming and the state st salad was supper.  Will be going back again [REVIEW_4] This is the best Thai food in St. Louis. Chicken Pad Thai that has never disappointed.. One of the very few restaurants in North County that beats all elsewhere; it's hard to even try other Thai! [REVIEW_5] Did a Garden District Walking Tour with Val. He was very knowledgeable & patient. Because he lived in the neighborhood; we got into places we probably wouldn't have with another guide. Highly recommend. [REVIEW_6] Great tour! Very informative  (our tour guide Raymond was awesome!) and the food stops along the way were very delicious. Definitely worth the time and money. [REVIEW_7] By far the WORST Taco Bell ever.  First problem was we found hair in our food and it turns out to be one of the rude supervisors and refused to even help us out and denied us our money back so the general manager who was awesome helped us out and refunded us. Then all of a sudden tonight after months of not going back to this we decided to and we specifically asked for our nacho cheese that's comes on the burrito to just put it on the side like all the other t bells do we never got charged for it and my boyfriend is deathly allergic to it and for a soft taco instead of hard shell. Of course it was all wrong cheese everywhere charged for the nacho cheese no soft taco and the young lady who took our order tried to argue with us saying ""you didn't say that"" last time I checked the customer is always right. Working in the food industry i know good service when i see it and she didnt have any of it. Her voice; attitude; body language all wrong. The manager at the time accommodated us. He was polite and so nice. But the young employee however was horrible and shouldn't be even interacting with people. Pathetic attitude; laughing as she got our order wrong and horrible service all around and nothing done about it no apology...nothing. This taco bell just needs new employees and people who actually pay attention to what's going on instead of goofing off. [REVIEW_8] This place is great!  I've had the Pho a few times & the Bánh mì.  Both are fantastic.  I've had some great egg rolls in my life; but these are definitely the best.  Authentic; fresh; & tasty.  What more could you ask for? [REVIEW_9] Sadly I am revoking my 5 star review of Gallagher's. I went here last night and asked for their world famous nachos. Guess what; new menu. SERIOUSLY you're going to get rid of the awesome nachos?  No more frosted beer mugs plastic cups. And they also changed the prices on pitchers. PBR now $12 instead of $9. This will not stand.  I would also like to mention the place smelled like a ""radio rock festival"" or cat urine. It looks like Gallagher's is changing for their new lame clientele and they just lost a great customer. [REVIEW_10] I tried the cinnamon bun brûlée. It. Was. Awesome. I would recommend that you heat it up if you're getting it. Takes this treat to a whoooooole notha level my friends! I'm a fan of the variety district donuts offers on a daily basis. [REVIEW_11] The staff at the South Street location are absolutely AMAZING!!! I threw my boyfriend a surprise birthday party at the upstairs bar. They did everything they could to make the event special. The food was outrageously delicious; the service was incredible and the room it self was spacious. I seriously have no complaints! Ryan who worked with me from day one to plan this party was so accommodating and friendly. I felt like he was just one of my friends helping me plan it. And Claire! So much good stuff to say about her. From the start of the party she came in and made all my crazy requests work. By the end she felt like family. I will for sure be using a Paddywhacks again for any private party. I highly recommend them! You seriously won't regret it! Thanks again Ryan; Claire and all staff! [REVIEW_12] I was satisfied in every aspect of this hotel.  It is located close enough to the waterfront attractions to where you could technically walk.  But it is not a very pleasant walk.  That said; the hotel offers a free round trip shuttle to that area which was punctual and pleasant.  Our room was spotlessly clean; the front desk service was quick and courteous; and the breakfast was pretty good for a hotel breakfast buffet.  If I am ever in Wilmington again; I would certainly stay here. [REVIEW_13] We've been meaning to stop in; and tonight; we finally did. And glad we were!  There isnt much different to say that everyone hasnt already said; so I will just reiterate some of the reasons why Taste of Havana will become a regular spot for us.   I had the Pan con Bistec; and my wife had the Cuban. We loved the bread (and everything between it). Usually we take home half our sandwiches to eat for a second meal; but I just wasnt ready to stop eating for the night; so alas; I dont have another meal. Guess I'll just have to go back!   And the company was just as inviting. We chatted with Diana (Dayana?); for quite a while after we ate; and she told us how she and her dad opened the restuarant; and how it really is a labor of love.   Try it out. Order a sandwich; have a seat; chat them up; and enjoy! I'm already looking forward to our next visit; and thinking about who else I want to bring with us.  Thank you for a wonderful evening! [REVIEW_14] This place was so yummy and decently priced. I felt that the escargot would have been better as traditional escargot but the playing was nice. You can dine with the ghost (former owner of the mansion who killed himself on their 2nd floor) for an additional $50. The table is by itself in a cold dungeony room. [REVIEW_15] My go-to for pizza in the montgomeryville/chalfont area! Always delicious; never disappoints. [REVIEW_16] I love love love facials with Becca at this beautiful spa. she is very professional and  knowledgeable on skincare along with Rescue's product lines. She makes me feel at very comfortable since I am seriously self conscience about my problematic broke out skin lately. I now use and purchased what Becca wrote out for me. Worth every penny; Lait U wash; PF50 toner; cream demopurifiante and mask vivant! She has given me hope again for clear skin! she also showed me how to apply with an upward motion and use baking soda once a week mixed with vivant for this face! Thank you Becca & Rescue see you all again soon! xoxo [REVIEW_17] Don't let the shopping center location deter you! Amazing place and even a more amazing staff. Curtis is the true epitome of great service. Loves his job and wants nothing more than for you to enjoy your dining experience. Try the scallops small plate; you won't regret it; but the whole dining experience is top notch. [REVIEW_18] My wife and 5 kids and I really enjoy the experience... we go quite often... they do a great job accommodating our group of seven... service is predictable and great... they take care of our kids... food comes fast... and is standard Mexican fare... I really enjoy the tacos al pastor!.  It's a rare place where all 5 kids ask to return often... and that's a lot of picky kids to accommodate! [REVIEW_19] Came for the first time today with family and Bailey was excellent; she was friendly and attentive and THE FOOD was incredible. We had the hummus plate (which was very generous portion); the pretzels; mozzarella sticks and caprese salad. Everything was fresh and I was impressed with the food as I had never been here before. We will be back!! [REVIEW_20] I had a great experience here! The ladies were extremely friendly. The gelato was OUTSTANDING. I had plain vanilla but it was so delicious. The red velvet cake was also wonderful. Highly recommended!",18
89,"[REVIEW_1] Fantastic place to get donuts; and their prices are amazing. This is definitely my go to place when I'm craving donuts. [REVIEW_2] This Starbucks always makes drinks correctly and the drive thru is fast... Even on busy mornings. [REVIEW_3] Had a wonderful experience today with my daughter and soon to be daughter in law.  Great job Lana and GiGi!.  Absolutely recommend. [REVIEW_4] If u love ice cream; you'll be in heaven here!  A must try!  So many unique flavors to choose from and they're always changing. [REVIEW_5] As someone from out of town; all I could look forward to was the food. And let me tell you it was a disappointment. I read many good reviews about this establishment. If I could give them no stars I would. Could not run out of there fast enough. Their half peeled shrimp was literal mush. They had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. The shrimp peel was brown; they were probably cooked about a month ago; put in a freezer and served them to me as they thawed. Their jambalaya was further than the truth. It was pasta in tomato sauce with a minuscule piece of chicken. And the fact that I had to pay as I left was bewildering. Not even their mediocre waiters could save; what I would call; the worst dining experience of my life. The only thing that made it worthwhile was when the hostess removed the atrocity that was my dinner and asked ""they nasty?"" [REVIEW_6] DISCLAIMER: this review is limited exclusively to my single experience last night eating prawn mee noodle soup at Penang.  Review: this dish was admittedly very fishy; which I was generally okay with. It almost tasted like the restaurant added fermented shrimp paste or something similar. That's also not an issue; in itself. However; it is now 8pm; and I have still not yet left my hotel room since getting back from Penang last night. I'm currently having the absolute worst food poisoning experience of my life.  According to my primary care physician; aka WebMD; it is likely that I have some form of aggressive salmonella food poisoning.  The other dishes looked good; and I'm sure the prawn mee is typically not vomit/diarrhea-inducing; but i hope this issue is addressed promptly. [REVIEW_7] santa barbara shellfish company wow great seafood very fresh and tasty try the uni with scallops wow the uni was really fresh still alive and moving on top of the fresh scallops wow some thing u must try it was so good that i end up getting 2 uni the grill lobsters wow fresh from the water then grilled some tasty stuff very very tasty the steamers clams wow also really fresh and tasty plus they got a good selection of craft beers check them out santa barbara shell fish company good eats yelp on yelpers [REVIEW_8] Amazing food! Great staff! It's a great environment for a great price. I highly reccomend everything on the menu! We had amazing red beans and rice as well as the gumbo. The Mac and cheese was tasty and so was the Gator on a stick (which is in sausage format). [REVIEW_9] This pub is awesome!! The restaurant is beautiful...wood furniture and tv's in the booths. The staff is always friendly and helpful as well. And the most important thing... the food is amazing!!! I always get the prime rib sandwich and it never fails. I also like that they offer a vegetable of the day rather then having to stick with chips or fries. The vegetables here are always fresh! My only complaint is that it's a little pricey. I get take out a lot and for two meals it's at least $20. Still; this place is worth a try!!! [REVIEW_10] Service and management terrible... After messing up all 4 of our orders the waiter got mad and started cursing... The manager offered our drinks to be free.. What a mess. The food was cold and nasty didn't even eat half of it and waited over an hour... I will never dine in any cracker barrel again after this experience... [REVIEW_11] My husband and I were visiting New Orleans and decided to schedule a couples massage. Our experience was great! My therapist was able to get all the painful knots out of my back. I could already feel the difference before I even walked out the door. My husband was so relaxed during his massage that he fell asleep. The atmosphere and decor were my favorite part of this experience. The low lighting and comfy chairs really promote relaxation. I have been to many different spas in many cities and the atmosphere here is always what I look for in a spa but rarely find. I wished they had light hors d'oeuvres and cold water option. The water was room temperature. Would definitely recommend this spa to a friend and we will definitely visit again next time we are in New Orleans. [REVIEW_12] We got there past 5pm on a Saturday night and the wait list is not long. Maybe like 4 people ahead of us on the list you get to choose to be seated inside or out. We chose both. 20 mins later; we noticed the list filled up fast! The wait is longer if you want to be seated outside. The food is GREAT! Only one unisex restroom available inside. [REVIEW_13] If I could post -1 stars I would! I mistakenly brought my 13 year old son and his friend here and didn't look around enough before paying .. I kid you not the bumper car area is as big as a 1 car garage.. They basically only had room to spin in circles. :-( the blow up slide reminds me of the smaller version of what you can rent for your back yard. They only have 10 arcade games.. Everyone including the parent has to pay to play.. The food is not even up to par with Chuck E Cheese. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand the staff is rude. My best advice is keep your coins in your pocket. [REVIEW_14] I loved loved loved the pizza here. I returned and got their gnocchi and it was amazing as well. Really fresh ingredients nice variety on the menu. Really felt like a small family restaurant in Europe. Best pizza in middle Tennessee. [REVIEW_15] I have groen up eating Italian food and i have not come across a more legit place than Mazzaros! Love their sauce and meatballs. [REVIEW_16] I love this place; service is fast and I find myself there every-time I'm in center city. During lunch time they have a great lunch special; they aren't the biggest rolls I have seen but they sure are delicious. From the outside it's blends in with the rest of the buildings but it so nice on the inside. My interaction with the staff has always been pleasant and I do love the little candy in the front next to the register. My order always consist of the sandwich roll and the cooked spicy scallop roll ( I have tried other but those two are my favorite). The lunch special come with either 2 rolls of 3 rolls with your choice of salad or soup. If you are looking for a nice place to eat for cheap this would be it [REVIEW_17] Actually gabbed a cheesesteak from next door and a drink from Marmont and sat at there outside tables.  Service was excellent and the drinks were great. [REVIEW_18] I'm at the hotel now. Finally got up to my room after they refused to let me check in 20 min early (but I saw them letting others check in). Let's not forget to mention I paid $400+ for one night here. The room is absolutely disgusting. There are stains everywhere. There is a loud ringing noise that I can't figure out what it is or where it's coming from. I'm absolutely disgusting by this place. [REVIEW_19] The margarita tasted like lemonade. It was AWFUL and tasted like it had no tequila in it at all. I asked to either switch it out for something else or for them to remake it and they wouldn't do either. I won't ever be back! Terrible service. [REVIEW_20] HOLY SMOKES!  actual pumpkin pie mixed in with the frozen custard......are you kidding me? Why hasn't this become a huge sweep the nation treat.   The best part was the chunks of pie crust. Like finding a diamond inside another diamond. Super yummy.",14
90,"[REVIEW_1] I really had a wonderful experience at the Nashville location; and we found out that New Orleans had one now and should go to it. Last night we got there kinda late around 10pm. Sat there for 10min and not one person greeted us. Went to the bar to see about service and she informed that the kitchen was behind on completing orders.  I had to apologize to my friends that we may not get any food after driving three hours down to enjoy the weekend. We did end up leaving the restaurant after 25 min wait for no service or an apology.   I have to say this not what I expected from a big known place for adults to have fun along with kids also. Please do something about this. I hope this is not a reflection of how others could become. [REVIEW_2] Yessiree!!  This place is truly my new favorite place to eat in St. Petersburg!  Small and intimate; with a cool rustic elegant vibe.  We showed up at 6:15 with no reservation and walked right in. By 6:30 there was a line at the door and an hour wait. The menu offers an eclectic mix and it all looked amazing!  We had the short rib appetizer to start. Which was glazed in an Asian sauce with a little kick yum!!. My husband had pasta with a white sauce which I swear he hummed with delight thru every bite. I kept it simple with a burger which I was told would be life changing. They weren't kidding! I have dreamt of it nightly since our visit. Will I go back?  Hell yeah!  I'd camp out for this place !! [REVIEW_3] Love their latte....and pastries.  This was a great place; I enjoyed my first time so much that it ended up being the only place I tried over the memorial day weekend.  They opened everyday at 6am; even on Memorial Day.  Giving them a 5 star; nothing more to say... [REVIEW_4] Ewww!!! I used to go to this location all the time; the staff was always friendly and I could count on it being good. There was also usually always an employee cleaning. However; after the experience I had today; I certainly won't be returning. The place was filthy. Food all over the window in front of where you order; food all over the floor; and food on almost every single table. I bit into my taco and thought it tasted weird; then looked and discovered that the chicken was dark meat with skin on it. Wtf happened to this place? I'm really disappointed. Please fix this store; no place where food is eaten should be this disgusting. [REVIEW_5] Ordered a couple of pizzas for delivery. I swear a cheap frozen pizza tastes better. It was semi warm; bland; and they must have been low on cheese that night. [REVIEW_6] This is an updated review. I've been ordering from silver mine's at the same location for the last 4-5 years and they have only gotten progressively worse. Don't ask for anything to be added to your soup or chili; they'll charge you for the additions but will not include them in the order. They'll also most likely to include the free side such as the bread. It literally takes at least an hour to get your food delivered; maybe they should call Jimmy Johns and ask the what their secret is. This business is in major trouble with all of the other options available. The service is worse than if you had a bunch of kindergarteners running the business; at least they would be nice. You guys are right next to Eller Business School; why don't you ask them how you can improve??? Currently; this place is an embarrassment to their industry; and a waste of space on University Blvd. NEVER ORDERING FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN. [REVIEW_7] Santorini Greek Island Grill is the best place to eat on the UCSB campus.  The food is fresh; well-prepared; and delicious.  The staff is efficient; courteous; and friendly (e.g.; they call you ""my friend"").  The menu is interesting; varied; and contains many healthy options. (I like the chicken pita meal.)  The place is well-managed and you can see that everyone there takes pride in what they do.  The prices are reasonable.  These are some of the reasons I have been a loyal customer for the last two years and why I plan to continue coming to Santorini's for lunch in the future. [REVIEW_8] We order here all the time and the pizza is delicious Well tonight the failed me we got and xl pepperoni and xl cheese steak no mushrooms... and 2 orders of cheese bread. We had it delivered we were told 45 min to an hr np  It took an hr and 25min the entire bottom of the pizza and bread sticks were over done  You could play the drums on it with a fork it was so hard!  Also cheese steak pizza had MUSHROOMS  GONNA be awhile before I order from you again Very disappointed [REVIEW_9] Couldn't have asked for a better location but horrible maid service and not worth the price. Horrible communication between the staff. The room was nice but didn't include a mini fridge or blow drier. The wi-fi was also a problem. It stopped working and when I asked the front desk about it they told me to call a number.... Which I was on hold for too long with. The pool was heated and had a nice view but one night was hot tub hot and the next was luke warm. Wouldn't recommend this hotel. [REVIEW_10] I live in Manhattan; but I visit New Orleans a lot. I love it there; and every time I'm in town; I make sure to go to Blue Dream Vintage. They always have awesome clothing; and obviously put a lot of time in curating what they bring into the shop. I always find something cute that is a one of a kind piece; but relevant to contemporary fashion. Well done; guys! I get compliments on my clothes every time I wear them! Can't wait to come back! [REVIEW_11] Was in town for the solar eclipse so I decided to see what the fuss was all about.  We went to the Historic Route 66 location.  Had the lemon crumb concrete my brother had a sundae.  Both were excellent.  Very creamy texture and flavor.  Line was long but was not that bad a wait.  A lot of out owners like me but just as many locals. [REVIEW_12] Gave this store one star only because I had to in order to post a review. Went here last week to get a new phone. Service was indifferent to say the least. Staff was condescending and barely polite. Not a good experience. [REVIEW_13] Don't bother to place an order in person.  With no other customers in the store I had to wait over five mins just before the guy would slowly walk around to the cash register to say; ""you didn't call it in"".  Which really upset me cause that means that there were no other Orders beside the one that he was slowly making while I waited. [REVIEW_14] Painfully slow. Painful parking (but on state street) nails barely lasted for gel compared to other places. The lady that did my nails could care less about me. A place I won't be back to. Sorry. [REVIEW_15] Great samples of beer; try the the flight. Good food! Love the atmosphere! Great service; good prices for the beer if you do the flight. I would recommend coming here if you love beer and different types of beer. Very time on drink and food. [REVIEW_16] I had a Friday night business dinner scheduled elsewhere; but we couldn't get a table until after 9:30pm so we decided to try Timpano. Had no problem getting in & now I know why. We had one of the worst meals & I spent almost $180.00. We sat outside; which was charming; except  we felt  lucky when the waiter showed up at our table. He was rushed & apologized for the lack of wine choices. The bread was wonderful... The Osso buco was hard; dry & so salty it was inedible. Sent that back; the waiter was nice about it; brought back the Scallop dish which was still oversalted &  really bad.  The side of grilled; Burnt; slimy asparagus was also salty & over cooked. And I truly wanted to send it back because it was horrible....did I mention cold? But we were starting to get in a hurry to leave so we could wash out the bad taste in our mouth.  My chicken dish was better than a microwave one from Big Lots; but the chicken was chewy; rubbery; 4 sure Not Organic; Farm Raised... Must be steroid chicken ; no taste; and I cannot remember the name of the dish; I believe it had a few morsels of pasta with it.  Ughh...  The 1 star is for our waiter ; he was OK; but I am SO OVER egoist; affected; waiters telling me about their view on wine; when they obviously have NO clue. I mention a Gaja Barberesco & he suggests the Amarone. And he continued with a Soliloquy on all the names of Top Italian Wines he knew & 10 minutes go by &  Guess what; they did not offer 1 of the them on their wine list!  So he wastes time trying to show me He Knows wine's names; but Timpanodoes not carry them.  The Beat thing I orderes was the cocktail I had in the beginning with Elderflower liquor; a splash of soda muddled mint &  cucumber. That was so refreshing.  My associate polished most of the Wine choice off her self. Which was good and was priced ok; I think the bottle was around $40.00.  Their wine list is minimal.  We expected an Italian Restaurant but it was more a New York Steak House.The food was ordinary; over salty; waaay over priced. And don't get me started on the Duo they booked 4 entertainment... Bottom line; That area of Hyde Parkis in construction & renovation so STAY AWAY. Wait 4 Goody Goody 2 open! That is something that I hear will be worth the parking hassle! [REVIEW_17] Holy crap worst haircut of my life!!! I feel terrible because she was so sweet but it looks like a 5 year old took scissors and started guessing! It's so bad I can't even wear it in a ponytail or bun without having choppy (what should be layers; looks like boxes) pieces that are super uneven hanging out. My ponytail looks like someone butcher my hair and left random pieces. Beware! I get my hair cut and trimmed regularly; figured this was closer to home and I'd try it out for a quick trim. Never again. It's not blended and evening blending couldn't fix it; the haircut alone wasn't straight; my right is longer then my left with randomly boxy chops. So embarrassed of my head!!! Have to go get it fixed elsewhere. [REVIEW_18] My experience with this particular store was... *sigh; eye roll* I felt uncomfortable from the time I left my car to checking out. I was stared at the entire time; maybe I was turning colors going from aisle to aisle; idk lmaooo. However; I retrieved the item I came for. The cashier at self-checkout was nice; though. And would you know; she spoke; too! lol. It takes one positive moment to outweigh every other trivial thing.   Thank God there are way more locations with great customer service and better stocked stores. And girl; my Amex will go where I'm accepted and celebrated...OK?! So; don't worry. The revolution won't be televised in the frozen fruit section. I'm good. I won't be back.  BUT: this is was Oakville. I acknowledged where I was; and I know what it is. [REVIEW_19] Great pizza! Amazing salads! Quick and friendly service at any of their locations! I highly recommend their chopped salad! [REVIEW_20] I was very excited to try this place. Went at 2:30 on Saturday. They are supposed to open at 2. After ordering; my friend and I were told that ""nothing was prepped"" and it would be 25 more minutes. We said we did not mind waiting. We waited an hour but nothing was ever ""prepped""; except Mac and cheese or charcuterie. We had the charcuterie and left. There was no attempt to make things right or explain. Very strange experience and poor/ no customer service. The waiter was nice though; and I felt sorry for him.",7
91,"[REVIEW_1] The food here was; simply put; amazing. I came here with three other people and we were able to get a reservation just a few hours beforehand (although it was a very cold night; so maybe it was an unpopular night for that reason). I'm pretty picky about sushi (and my boyfriend is even pickier) and we both loved it. The rock shrimp tempura was outstandingly fresh with a mild wasabi sauce and melt-in-your-mouth shrimp. The Izumi roll; scallops; and sashimi sampler were all great; although I've had slightly better tuna at other restaurants. Don't skip dessert here! The ""un donut"" dessert was unexpectedly delicious--almost like a cider donut; served fresh; hot; and crispy on the outside; soft in the middle. Considering the portion sizes you get in a typical sushi restaurant; I thought they were quite generous (the veggie tempura is a meal in itself).  It was a slow night at the restaurant and service was a bit slow (I think there was only one waiter); so I could see how that could be a problem when they are very busy. But; it wasn't enough of an issue to knock a star off. [REVIEW_2] Only tried the hip city ranch chicken sandwich and fries but WOW were they delicious. Sandwich was on point (could've been a tiny bit crispier in my opinion) but the taste and portion was excellent. Will definitely be visiting again. Only downside is that the space is tiny and you most likely will not find a seat if you go on the weekend between 12 & 5 pm. [REVIEW_3] Probably the best burger joint in Santa Barbara area. [REVIEW_4] Saddest thing about leaving New Orleans will be not going to Il Posto nearly every morning.  This place has everything I'd want from my neighborhood cafe fit with the best coffee; iced green tea with mint; bagels; caper berries and their homemade pumpkin chocolate chip delights.  The best place to go to relax after a hard week with some food and coffee.  Do yourself a favor and get one of their homemade oreo cookies. [REVIEW_5] The worst wawa I've ever been to. Don't recommend ordering food inside: their employees are just standing and talking until you actually get something else; pay; walk around for a little; check if it's done yet and finally give them a look. That's when they go ""oh! There's food to make!"" Making latte in the morning takes them over 5 minutes; they're watching videos on their phones; chatting and slowly walking towards their stations. I hate the fact that it's the only place where I can get coffee on my way to work. I am the manager at the local pizza chain and my employees would never disrespect customers like that: if food has to be made they make it instead of talking! If the manager is reading this right now please take care of the situation; look at the cameras and you will see. The whole point of getting food and coffee at wawa in the morning it's because it's FASTER. But that's not what your employees think. [REVIEW_6] AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE!! I have never gotten extensions before or been in a beauty supply store so I was nervous because I don't know anything about extensions. I was blown away by Aaliyah (hope I spelled her name correctly). She was soo friendly and helpful!! She helped me find the right color I needed and I left feeling happy. [REVIEW_7] This place is filthy dirty; and so are the workers. They don't sanitize or clean the bowls they use for Man I'd or the little marbles and they don't sanitize the tools they use for either Mani or pedi. [REVIEW_8] Buckingham Pizza makes the best pizza around; particularly its plain pizza and a few of its specialities -- try the cool ranch pizza. This is a pizza parlor. Don't get fancy....order the pizzas and maybe some sides. While some of the entrees are good (chicken piccata); stay with the pizza and you'll love it. [REVIEW_9] While on vacation during Mardi Gras my friends and I ate here twice!! The people were super nice and the food was delish!! Definitely a must when going through New Orleans!! [REVIEW_10] My girlfriend and I had the best time here!  Definitely the most fun and relaxed place for wine tastings. Great wines with good prices. We will for sure be back. [REVIEW_11] Came for the first time today with family and Bailey was excellent; she was friendly and attentive and THE FOOD was incredible. We had the hummus plate (which was very generous portion); the pretzels; mozzarella sticks and caprese salad. Everything was fresh and I was impressed with the food as I had never been here before. We will be back!! [REVIEW_12] My review is primarily about delivery and customer service.    Delivery. I have attempted (by myself and with friends/family) to have Reginelli's delivered to my house on four separate occasions in the last year.  The first time it came within the stated time frame and was ok; so we continued to order.  The last three times I've ordered Reginelli's they always say that delivery will be about 45 minutes (thats ok) but when the hour mark occurs I usually give them a call to ask as to the status of my order.  They always say; ""We're sorry; we suddenly got really busy; its on its way.""  (This wasn't on a weekend; holiday or Mardi Gras; so go figure about the sudden rush)  ...  My pizza finally arrived somewhere around the 2 hr mark and was stone cold (all three times).  The first time I called them back to complain and the lady on the phone basically said; ""We're sorry; we'll replace it but it will be at least hour and a half before we get it to you.""   The last two times; I didn't even bother to call.    If a pizza delivery comes late once; thats understandable; it does happen; but when it happens three times with the same company then its time to call someone else. [REVIEW_13] I absolutely loved my wedding dress! They have a great selection and the store is very clean. I was always treated the same way every time I walked in there; even after my dress was way paid for. I want to put on my wedding dress every day ! [REVIEW_14] I have red pinstripes in my blood.  Let's rule the NL East again Phils ... and maybe this year the dice will roll in our favor all the way to a parade on Broad Street.  And to my favorite Phillie - Cliff Lee .... I wouldn't mind another seven shutouts this year as well. [REVIEW_15] Here on Saturday morning. It was packed but we waited a total of 15 minutes from start to finish. The donuts themselves are excellent alone. We got Half a dozen; one maple glazed bacon; one peanut butter chocolate drizzle; one blueberry powder; one lemon coconut; one blueberry coconut; and one glazed chocolate. And we both shared a bite out of each. No complaints. Order by preference. I mean what can you say about them...They're donuts.  They're slightly crispy; fresh; hot and yummy. [REVIEW_16] Oh hell yes. So good!  I usually would not drive so far out of my way for a restaurant; but we came here with some family and I am so glad we did! I'd never been to Dunedin prior to this; and what a cute little place it is! Adorable little downtown area that you'd never expect from such a small town.   Anywho; Kelly's. When we went; it was jam packed. I believe the wait was 30-45 minutes; so it would certainly behoove you to call ahead and make a reservation. The service was good for how busy it was. Not super quick; but friendly and punctual enough. You can only expect so much when they're packed to the gills.   The food was phenomenal; and priced pretty fairly for the quality. Perhaps a teensy tiny bit overpriced compared to similar restaurants; but overall can't complain there. I had the seafood pasta and hoooooly cow. Cannot wait to go back for more. It was absolutely decadent; and I'm not even a fan of pasta. If you're already a pasta lover this will knock your socks off. The pasta was so tender and the dish had such a great; deep seafood flavor- not weak or briny at all. My mouth is watering a bit just thinking about it.   My husband had the baby back ribs and they were devoured in a matter of minutes; so I would guess that means they were good. I can't remember off the top of my head what the other diners had; but I do remember everyone was very; very happy with their meals.   Highly recommended! [REVIEW_17] I went to the salon for a hair cut and Meghan was my stylist. She did an ABSOLUTELY amazing job and was full of personality. I got a wash; cut; and blow out all for $27 bucks because it was my first time! I also got a coupon to come back for 20% off anything I have done in the salon which I will be redeeming later this month. I am very excited to find a great salon that is near my house & doesn't cost a million dollars to get something done.   I have been here for the Benefit Brow Bar as well which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND; if you want your brows to look amazing - it is the best place you can go . I trust them with my life.   I really can't say anything negative about Ulta. I am surprised at the ""rude customer service"" complaint because I have only experienced the best here. (plus there is always a coupon so I really REALLY love this place).  OK bye! [REVIEW_18] I moved to STL from Nashville; TN; where I had one hell of a hairdresser. It took me a while to find a hairdresser as well as the one I had in TN; but I found it at V Vegaz. I go to Jason. I have curly hair; but often wear it straight. If you have curly hair; and you are serious about a good cut; then you know how hard it is to find a hairdresser that knows curly hair. If so; Jason is your man. Great salon!! And if you work on The Loop; you get a 15% discount. Can't beat that! [REVIEW_19] By far THE BEST sushi... small place; but the sushi is absolutely to DIE FOR.. the Sexy Alhen is my favorite; they are known for the Sexyman Roll. ALL of the rolls are good; original; and there is a huge variety to pick from.  Staff is friendly; and service is good. [REVIEW_20] Been a long time customer but really feel they've been slipping lately. Ordered a pie at 2:25 today and took over an hour to get here. Obviously cold when it finally arrived. Time for a break I think....",16
92,"[REVIEW_1] Horrible!  I called to order an item and to insure I would be able to receive it the next day; which I agreed to pay for overnight shipping. I was told that it was pulled and ready to ship out for next day delivery. I was told that I would receive an email with this information the same day. Upon my 3rd call to get this information I was told that it was shipped ground and would receive it in 3 days. Mind you it is being shipped from Indianapolis and I live in Chicago. Will never buy from them again. [REVIEW_2] They treated me very badly here. I was a regular customer that developed a relationship with one of the nail techs. She did excellent work that always stood the test of time. One evening I was running 15 minutes late and I texted the woman that did my nails. Apparently; one of the employees was looking at the wrong day and booked my nail tech at the same time. When I arrived; she thought the incident occurred because I was late for my appointment and because I contacted the nail tech directly rather than the business itself. She didn't realize she had been looking at the wrong day. She proceeded to yell at me and tell me it was all my fault in front of the entire salon. I apologized for not calling the business directly and she never acknowledged her error on scheduling on the wrong day.  During another incident; my nail tech was going to come in on her day off to accommodate a special event that I had. When I called the salon to let them know due to the above incident; they talked to me in a horrible manner and that day I told my favorite nail tech (after searching for years) I couldn't visit her salon anymore. 3 months later; we finally reunited and she has since left that salon. [REVIEW_3] Stay anywhere but here! They got so little right during our three night stay. Staff not at all helpful during check in when our prepaid rooms had been reassigned to other guests. Maids were the noisiest we've heard in the mornings; playing TV loud with doors open while cleaning; joking around in the hallways in front of doors with Do Not Disturb signs. They actually were whistling loudly up and down the hallway in order to wake the guests!They made up the beds without straightening the bottom sheets. A child could do a better job of making a bed. The elevators smelled; noisy AC units; tiny bathrooms -- we even had to ask for water glasses for our rooms. From what I hear; all this is typical of a Hyatt Place. We won't be staying at one again. [REVIEW_4] I legit just walked into Blaze being 9pm and as soon as I got to the line I was told that they are closed. I'm not sure if this is correct as the hours online and on the front door states that they are open until 10pm daily. I also checked the website before coming into Blaze. This pizzeria is new to the area so I was actually pretty stoked to check them out and unfortunately my first experience is not what I expected. It would have been courteous for them to give me an explanation for their time change on a Tuesday night. [REVIEW_5] My boyfriend and I arrived at Don Pablo's at 5:45 on Saturday night. We were told the wait was 30 minutes- awesome. After 45 minutes passed; we checked in with the hostess again. "" Oh; you had a faulty buzzer"". No apology; no coming to find us; nothing. The manager took us to our table; again no apology- just explained that this happens a lot.  After being seated; our server came 15 minutes later for our drink order. No introduction; just ""What do you want to drink."" After ordering a margarita and beer; we waited another 10 minutes for our drinks to arrive.  I regret our appetizer of flauetas or whatever they are called. Frozen taquitos that were rock hard when they arrived at my table. After the appetizer; it took 35 minutes for our entrees to reach the table. My boyfriends was cold and mine was incorrect. After already being in this restaurant for over 2 hours; we had enough. The waiter saw we were frustrated and took one meal off the bill. Terrible service; terrible food; terrible management. First and last visit for us! [REVIEW_6] Stayed there on Sunday; and some drunk kids in the room next door ripped the sink off the wall; at 2:30am; thus the entire hotel fire alarm went on for the next hour. Talked to the front desk; and they couldn't do anything about it. That being said; if I can't sleep; it's not a hotel room at all. [REVIEW_7] these people are great. through the years we've experienced everything and seen probably every doctor. these are true animal people; through and through; and you can always count on them for the best. not much else to say! [REVIEW_8] At their previous location; I tried Phat Bites. It was dirty and gross. I literally saw the guy mixing a potato salad with his bare hands and then wipe his nose to return to mixing.   Years later; at their new location; I decided to give them another chance. I will concede they said they have a new cook this morning; but my oh my; the food was so bland and undercooked and just overall gross. It's bad enough that the environment is reminiscent of a garage sale turned restaurant - where the items were kept in their original condition by failing to clean them. But on top of that; it's just overall dirty.   Now; the icing on this dirty cake; is that the servers (if you can call them that) are not kind. They are unaware of the menu; they act like it's a burden to help. They need training. One guy was way more concerned with air drumming than attending to my drink order.   It's a bunch of young people; poorly trained; making gross food; in a dirty environment; where they're too cheap to provide real silverware or even a salt shaker. And WAY OVERPRICED. I got to pay $50 for my crap experience.   Seriously; let this place be overtaken by the mold that's likely growing in the corner of the room.   Thank you.   I will never return to this place again. [REVIEW_9] Perfect New Orleans experience! Live music; great food and drinks!  There are refrigerators with cheeses; beer; water; and white wines. Reds as well as some whites/champagnes are displayed around the room. Plan on getting their early to secure a table and chairs. Next to the register there are buckets for ice to keep drinks cool.   We were looking to try something new and the staff is well versed in their inventory and gave us great advice.Great ""pick your own"" cheese plate; served with delicious toast points. Be sure to bring some cash if you plan on ordering from the chef cooking outback. You can visit their website and see the calendar of rotating chefs and musicians. [REVIEW_10] Literally the best meal I have ever eaten. I was in Nashville for a week for work and I went to Edley's three times and got the pulled pork platter every time. It's life changing. My boyfriend got the hot chicken plate every time and said that was also the best he'd ever had. This place is unreal. It's also not that expensive - only about $10 /platter and it comes with two sides and cornbread... and if you don't like cornbread you can swap it for another side. I did not love the mac and cheese but I pretty much always hate baked mac. The banana pudding is BOMB and the mashed potatoes are great too. I really don't think you could go wrong here. [REVIEW_11] Beautiful restaurant in a great location!  Came in for dinner before heading to a show at The Straz. Best decision I made that day for sure!  I made reservations for an early dinner so I was seated at a comfortable booth.   Menu was steak centric for sure so I went with the Ribeye. I also indulge in calamari; raw oysters and a bottle of Groth Cab. Service was top notch and the experience was first class all the way.   The ribeye was spot on mid-rare. Calamari was the best I've had in Florida and the oysters (blue points) were as fresh as could be.   And you know what else happened?  The GM; AGM and Executive Chef all stopped by the table to ensure everything was perfect. I felt like a Zagat critic!    Next time I'm in Tampa I'm making Timpano my first stop.   Apparently they treat everyone like a big shot there... [REVIEW_12] This place gets one star they need to replace the whole staff me and my friends have labeled this place as super ghetto; some servers are nice I guess but there's no structure; management doesn't know how to compensate for horrible service; I've been to other applebees and it was not like this; I would suggest new management. And If you're looking for even a little bit of class don't come here. [REVIEW_13] Not worth the 50% off. I knew I had a bad feeling the second I walked in. The restaurant was a bit too hot for a sushi bar with fish sitting there behind the un-refrigerated glass all day. I should have listened to my gut but I made a huge mistake. I ended up getting so sick! Some of the worst sushi I have ever had; horrible service; and less than 1 star quality food. [REVIEW_14] Where to start...Darin is awesome! Him and his team (our driver Ron) did an amazing job hosting our group through the different wineries. We could not decide on specific places so we put our trust in Darin and he totally hooked us up!  My group had an absolute blast on the trip (killer sound system; cold waters available; good vibes).  I would 100% recommend JOTSB so anyone traveling to Santa Barbara for some good wine. [REVIEW_15] DO NOT shop there! Driver decided to drive off with out fridge- after 4 hours on the phone resolution was a 10% coupon and delivery... In 4 days!! Worst experience ever! Unprofessional and rude! Would never shop there again. Beware!! [REVIEW_16] Used to shop at the Vons; but now I'm really happy Haggen is here in Goleta. I like the samples and the friendly service. The deli salads are really good; makes it easy to eat healthy. Goleta needed a store like Haggen; it's nice to be able to get everything I need at one store. [REVIEW_17] Great little family joint.  Shrimp; oyster and crawfish all delicious [REVIEW_18] The food is EXCELLENT!!!! You order at the counter and then go sit down. They bring you your good and they are FAST!! My fiance order the chicken gyro and I order the beef kabob.  The plates are HUGE!! [REVIEW_19] Went here this Friday and had Rendang. Okay food (worth the price). Horrible service. Servers took turn to rush us by constantly asking if we were finished while we clearly were not. When we were done; we had separate checks. One friend tipped 10% for it and had a female server chased us down outside and COMMANDED (exact words: ""COME HERE!"" with a frown on her face) my friend to come back inside and QUESTIONED her with rudeness why she didn't tip 15%. My friend who used to work at a country club didn't even bother to explain to her what is actual serving. By this time; I was truly regretful for tipping at all. Don't get me wrong; the food is not bad; but not worth the service that we had. We would never visit this place again. [REVIEW_20] First of all i wasn't greeted . Then we was serve on dirty trays that was wiped with dirty rags . Also the restroom was disgusting as well as table and chairs we sat on. Sorry but will not be coming back and definitely spreading the word of this place.",8
93,[REVIEW_1] Great food and service. The antipasto was by far the best that I have ever had.  The pasta is all fresh and full of flavor. The Fisherman's stew was loaded with great tender fish in a saffron sauce. [REVIEW_2] Checked in on a beautiful Thursday morning for my honey's birthday.  Had a masseuse come up for her gift massage while I sat out on the parapet reading; next to a hummingbird nest in the adjacent tree (two eggs the size of Tic Tacs). Then we went out for First Thursday Art Crawl (way too many people) and dinner. Back to the Eagle; where we turned on the fire and got into the hot tub.  Very quiet and pretty room; great ambiance; enjoyed breakfast in bed the next morning. Finished our visit by taking two of their bikes on a ride along the beach before the crowds descended. [REVIEW_3] Stayed here the day of our wedding. The first room smelled like cigarettes. The second room smelled like chlorine. Mind you I don't have a good sense of smell either. [REVIEW_4] Wonderful company to do business with. We had two homes outside of Tucson that were left in questionable condition after a bad contractor had his way with them and needed a reputable licensed electrician to go over everything with a fine toothed comb. Bonnie understood our situation as we already had a buyer for the home; ready to move in and needed to address any potential issues ASAP. She sent us Anthony; a wonderful guy who really knows his stuff. He did a thorough job of reviewing the entire service; including the breaker boxes; lines throughout each structure as well as the outlets and switches. One week later he was out addressing each item that was a cause of concern so that we could hand over the keys to our buyer with confidence; knowing that the homes were safe and fully operational. I highly recommend Buddy Heilig & Sons to anyone in the local Tucson area needing electric service! [REVIEW_5] Visited here while staying in town at a hotel with my dog. So much better than the dog parks in New York! Beautiful park; kept up nice; clean; beautiful bridge; lovely stream; and fenced in area for doggie play. What more can you ask for? [REVIEW_6] Great food! I had ordered 4 for on the road and request the veggie in a different bag and in toasted it. This way you can toast it at home if you live 2 hours away like me! Had three there with a few friend. Must try the shaved ice it's amazing!!! Friendly and good service do not serve other people before you based on ethnicity like thuy cafe down the street. [REVIEW_7] My family and I came to visit Reno for a weekend and we came here two days in a row because it was just that good! The first night we came in looking for some good boba and a crispy chicken snack; and boy did we find something much more! This place does it all with their Taiwanese snacks. My dad told me it reminded him of actual Taiwan because everything was so authentic!   We ordered the crispy chicken snack; the clam soup; and some green bean smoothies and it was just amazing!  The following day we came back for the braised pork and egg rice; the beef noodle soup; the green onion pancake; salt and pepper chicken wings; and some more green bean smoothies. Definitely didn't disappoint the second time around either :) [REVIEW_8] Ready to fall in love? Want your little broken heart to be mended? 2 words...Seafood beignet  See below for your directions to bliss:   Tucked in a little adorable neighborhood in New Orleans we stumbled upon this hip little joint called Katie's! While we had heard it was the best place to eat in town we weren't convinced until....you guessed it; we took that first delicious bite of their famous seafood beignet stuffed with crawfish; shrimp; crabmeat; onions; cheese; jalapeños;mozzarella and topped with a jalapeño aioli....a religious experience to say the least    As an appetizer we were convinced that it couldn't get any better than that and then...BAM  The Bordeaux was delivered...A pizza topped with Cochon de lait; roasted garlic; spinach; red onions; scallions and a garlic butter cream reduction...We were left speechless by the unmatched flavor; the perfection of the dough; the Cochon literally melted in our mouths...  Perhaps one of the most delightful culinary experiences I've had in quite some time! I'll let you be the judge! ‍ [REVIEW_9] No pizza ready so much for hot and now. Just told it would be a while when I asked. Don't bother if you didn't order. [REVIEW_10] Enjoyed my shrimp lo mein; egg drop soup; and egg roll.  Prices are reasonable and delivery was fast. [REVIEW_11] I have been using Jack Flash for 10 years. They provide exceptional service and work that is always priced-right. As a family-owned business; there's a personal touch to all the interactions I have with the employees. They are friendly and care about doing an exceptional job.   They have: Rewired /rerouted electrical boxes in our home Added lights & fixtures Fixed outlets  In one instance; they smelled gas leaking! It was a small leak that could have been something big. PECO fixed it!  Jack flash is the best! 10 stars! [REVIEW_12] I ate here for the first time last Friday. I was extremely happy with the experience. There were 4 of us. Drinks: great selection of craft beer and a very interesting cocktail menu. I had a bourbon cocktail called On the Roof and it was very good. They are a little pricey at $8 but it was something different. We had appetizers. The Salmon dip was spicy and sweet and awesome. We also had the calamari and the dipping sauce was excellent. For entrees 2 had the blackened Salmon with a corn compote (delish) and we had the Salmon Fish tacos. Not the best I ever had but still very good for the middle of America. I had the burger if the day. Prepared with roasted peppers and onions on a nice soft bun. They served it with crispy shoestring French fries sprinkled with parm cheese. There were so many things on the menu I wanted to try. [REVIEW_13] Our food was delicious and the service was great!! Great ambiance. Sat outside and people watched. Lovely lunch!! [REVIEW_14] My dogs and i love this place!   Always try to go when they have sales going on.  They have a wide variety of toys and are pretty well stocked.  They even allow your pets to come in with you.  The staff is very caring and friendly.  Whenever I have a question about a certain product; they give me a great answer or find someone who knows more about it.  Even though it's a chain store; I feel like it's a nice neighborhood pet store. [REVIEW_15] Finally a real coffee shop in New Tampa!!! The nitro iced coffee was great and the staff very friendly. [REVIEW_16] I finally got my water ice fix this weekend. Well actually; I kind of went twice; ssshh. The chocolate-cherry gelati was seriously orgasmic. Why did it take me until August to finally make it down there??! I will definitely be back a few more times while they are still open for the season. And if you haven't been; GO! I corrupted not one; but two Rita's fans this weekend. [REVIEW_17] I came here with my bridal party for manis/pedis so there were 7 of us and we all had a wonderful experience. Everyone was beyond friendly from the start. We had brought champagne and mimosas and snacks and they had brought out a table for us to use and napkins and were so kind if we made spills and were more than accommodating. They went above and beyond for each of us with our manis and pedis and giving extra massages. They just seemed to really cater to our bridal party experience which was a huge deal for us. I felt like we all bonded with all of the ladies in addition to actually enjoying our bridal experience. It was wonderful!! I will definitely be coming back again. These women were so thoughtful and generous and are good at their job. and I will have to tell people to come here. [REVIEW_18] great food; great view. Try the lobster mac and cheese [REVIEW_19] I usually stop and eat at Miss Saigon in the same parking lot as this restaurant. They are closed on Tuesdays; so I tried this place. The place is clean; the staff is pleasant and the food is phenomenal!  It's going to be a tough choice to make now as to which Vietnamese restaurant to choose between the two. The other one has more interesting / inviting atmosphere and decorating with a small bar; but the unsweetened iced tea here is flavored with Ginger or something that's absolutely delicious! [REVIEW_20] Unfortunately; I paid over $100.oo for a NYE night out at this club. It was; absolutely the worst. The bathrooms were awful and did not work. It is a 'smoking' club with zero ventilation. I literally had to walk out several times during the night to just breathe. The food was cold; soggy and unpalatable. Service was ; basically; non-existent. What a waste of a New Years celebration but a fitting end to a miserable year. I will NEVER venture back here again !,17
94,"[REVIEW_1] I am so angry with myself for having foolishly fallen for their sign-up offer. They made it seem so simple and it was tied to my American Airlines account so I was even offered bonus airline miles as a sign-up incentive. They've been charging me over 19cents kWh for well over two years now. I wasn't even aware that other companies charge between 9 - 10 cents. I'm angry at myself for not canceling much sooner. I just got off the phone with them now to cancel and was told that it ""will take one to two billing cycles for the cancelation to officially go through"" so I will be paying a fortune for some time more. I recall it was instantaneous to START an account with them. Why the difference?   Great. Right in the middle of the summer. Stay far away from this company; people. [REVIEW_2] First time paddleboarding. 3 women from the East Coast..so we were nervous. We were newbies to paddleboarding.  Grant was our instructor and he was amazing and patient and has the best Aussie accent (it's real too!). We had great instruction on the ground and safety instruction before hitting the water. We did really well and owe it all to Grant and his individual attention and not pushing us beyond our capabilities. We ventured farther out to sea where the waters were a little bumpy and we were just determined to stay standing. 2 of us fell numerous times but had the best time. Grant brought lunch from Trader Joe's. yum. we loved it. We woud recommend this company and Grant to everyone; in fact; we already have shared it with others. [REVIEW_3] Simply a beautiful train station; with gorgeous architecture and ceiling design.  Very clean and easy to navigate with clear announcements; helpful employees; and signs everywhere.  Plenty of food options and seating.  I definitely wouldn't mind coming through here again if the need arises.  I wish Newark Penn Station would do some work to be more like this place. [REVIEW_4] Saw this place had good reviews and wanted to try. The drinks don't look as dressed up in person as it does in the photos; but they are good! I got the shatkys rum punch and loved it! Not on the beach but close. So you can enjoy some drinks and head to the beach across the street and vice versa. Service is very friendly as well. Would reccomend :) [REVIEW_5] Amazing pizza. AMAZING! After my first bite; I felt like that Oprah Winfrey meme; where her head is thrown back; her mouth is agape and her arms are open wide; and she's screaming; ""You get a car!"" Except it's not Oprah; it's me. And I don't get a car -- I get a pizza. But I felt that excited.    This is basically the pizza I have been looking for since moving to the Indianapolis area. It's a whole lot of nothing: It's not cut into square pieces. It's not crispy and thin. It's not redolent of oregano. It's thick and chewy; cheesy; greasy; wonderful -- it tastes the way pizza is supposed to taste! I have found my new pizza home. [REVIEW_6] Horrible Customer Service. I asked for a quote on my car from damages from the tornado. I thought he wrote everything down and he called me several times so that I can repeat the damages. The next day; I called to notify Vic that 2 of my small windows that I originally thought were broken are actually intact. I asked him could he adjust the quote and he told me to just subtract the price from the other windows. He was so frustrated that I requested the quote he hung up the phone or so he thought. He thought he hung up and proceeded to vent his frustrations about me loudly and rudely to whomever was in the shop. I stayed on the phone until he picked it up to express why I would not patronize his establishment. I understand that Vic is reasonable; but you get what you pay for and that's lack of respect and customer service by the owner! [REVIEW_7] Excellent omg the BBQ shrimp sauce with the bread is excellenta (I made up that word). We were walking in the area and we were told by our dentist to stop in. I am so glad I remembered the name. The Bloody Mary was also really good. The staff is amazing so very good. Come in hungry or not you will find something good. I wasn't even hungry and I had to dip the bread in the sauce. After our meal they gave us the best hot towels. [REVIEW_8] Came with the family based on a recommendation and was not disappointed.  I consider myself to be a bit of a Pizza connoisseur and this was right up there.  The staff was friendly and the food came out quick.  Solid experience across the board.  I would come back and recommend it to others. [REVIEW_9] Went here twice over last weekend.  The first time I was not too impressed by the food quality but the beer was very good according to everyone that drank it.    However the second time they let us host a wedding toast after a friend's wedding at the river walk.  These guys are really nice and were unbelievably generous with their space.  They let us bring in our own champagne and cupcakes to setup for the after party of our friends nuptials.  We agreed that people would still order off the menu but what a great group of guys for helping us out after we needed a space and the bar manager at the Silver Legacy cancelled on us at the last minute. [REVIEW_10] This place is great in theory but the execution borders on offensive. I'm admittedly fresh from an interaction with front desk manager Ali; who --when I asked why my room wasn't made up despite my  calling housekeeping; stopping by the front desk and activating the green ""make up room"" button -- behaved as though making the bed; cleaning the bathroom and replenishing the tea supply was far above and beyond the call of duty for a hotel despite a guest asking three times for them to do their job. In less time than I spent requesting the service; i could have cleaned my own room. Worse still she accused me three times during two conversations of likely not knowing the difference between the green service button and the red do not disturb button. A lovely housekeeper who was nice enough to come up at 2am to bring me tea and towels for the morning saw the green button was on.     No one knows the hotel policies or amenities and I got a different answer every time I asked a question.   The binder in the room indicates that I can either use the in-room safe or a safety deposit box located at the concierge desk. When I asked the concierge to give me use of the safety deposit box; they said they had no idea what I was talking about and said maybe the front desk has that service. The front desk said there's no such safe deposit box and explained to me very slowly as tho I was a complete moron that im obviously confusing the box in my closet with a safe deposit box. No one has read their own guest binder.   The binder and literature also says there is a pool. There is not. There is not a even single place to sit or walk outside; and not just because construction is going on for the next 3 years. They could have provided some small deck or garden  area for guests to go for a breath of fresh air; since there are no balconies or windows that open.   There was turn down service on my first night here but not the second or third. Had they been providing what they claim to; they'd have been able to alert housekeeping that my green ""make up room"" light had been on for nine hours. I don't really care if my bed gets made; but if nothing is done despite the signal outside the door; à call (and voicemail) to housekeeping and physical visit to the front desk where I was assured the room was serviced; that's just bad management.    Post script: I was trying to sleep in after a late night and between 9:30 and 10:30 am the housekeepers were chatting loudly in the hall outside my room and in the adjoining room. I did not so much mind being awakened by their work; as much as terrified when -- after id dozed back off -- they repeatedly tried to open my door despite the red light being illuminated for DO NOT DISTURB. I called the front desk who put me in touch once again with housekeeping where I left a voicemail. It's like no one is in charge of this place. Not hospitable.    The gym is decent and security; bellmen and casino personnel were all lovely. [REVIEW_11] Was very disappointed to be informed that this resturant claimed to have a business casual dress code on a Saturday evening.  Despite the reservations that were made and no obvious signs stating a required dress code. [REVIEW_12] I was lucky enough to spend 2 weeks in Boise for ""work."" Spent my free time drinking my way around Boise's great craft beer scene. I visited about 10 breweries or brewpubs and Payette was far and away my fav. Tons of beers on tap. I would guess probably 30. Fun custom 4 beer flights; and cheap too! Like hard to believe cheap. Beautiful building and space. No food; but on both of my visits they had a food truck parked outside. Great vibe. Oh yeah; and most importantly; the beer is excellent! [REVIEW_13] Great dairy-free options - the purple taro flavor is loved by most people.  Don't forget to grab your cone up front before heading back to the machines! [REVIEW_14] Thank you Chef John Besh!  My husband and I stayed at the Hilton hotel on St. Charles. One of my main goals was to find some delicious New Orleans grinds.  I was starving when we arrived and didn't want to do any research on Yelp for a place to eat.  Thank God Luke was connected to our hotel!!!  We ended up eating here 3 times over 5 days.  It's usually full of business suits; but that doesn't bother me when the food is so good.  All the traditional dishes were good; but the huge surprise was the burger.  I was against ordering a burger while I was in New Orleans; because I wanted to try as many local eats as possible... and you can find burgers anywhere.  I overheard this lady raving about how delicious her burger was; so I had to order it the next time we ate there.  She was absolutely right!  It was one of the best burgers I've ever had!  It was huge; juicy; and packed with flavor.  I also highly recommend getting their bread pudding a la mode.  It was mouth-watering good and straight out the oven! [REVIEW_15] Bruno's is our new favorite pizza spot! They're pizzas are delicious and even heat up great the next day. They're cheesesteaks are the best in the area. We were committed  Tú Sei Bella fans; but Bruno's has had us coming back consistently :) [REVIEW_16] Do not stay here!    We had a very bad experience with this hotel.  Let me start by saying that we reserved a room for our wedding night.  The next morning we had a very early flight to Montego Bay so we checked out of our room around 5:30 a.m. the next morning.  We actually had no complaints until we tried to use our debit card on a large purchase in Jamaica on our honeymoon and it was denied.  OK; this special time that only happens once in your life.... was completely ruined because this hotel charged our account 3 TIMES for the room amount at a whopping $240 a pop. We only left a small amount in our checking account because we were travelling out of country (just in case something happened and someone got our card number or something).  After getting charged $19.99 per MB to check our bank account using data on my cell phone; we discovered this MESS that Courtyard put us in.    We had planned on a couple's massage by the beach in Jamaica but that couldn't happen!  Plans on our honeymoon were ruined and I am still very upset!!!  After getting back into the states on a Saturday evening; I called the hotel to try and figure out what as going on.  I was told that a manager would have to speak with me and she would not be in until Tuesday.  I was forwarded to her voicemail and left a message.  The manager finally got back with me and she stated that she had no idea what was going on.  I explained to her my process through booking: I am a Marriott Rewards Member so I just logged into my account and booked a room.  After realizing that I would not be about to check into the room at check in since our wedding was at 4pm I called the hotel and added my husband to the account so that he could check into the room.  I also asked about how much the deposit for the room would be since Marriott usually charges a deposit in case of any charges.  The lady told me that it varies per hotel and I told her that I needed to know (since we were only transferring a certain amount into our checking).  She called the hotel and then finally got back on the line with me... she said that the deposit would not be more than $50.  When he went to check in he told them he wasn't sure what name the reservation was under it could have been either one of our last names. They found the reservation and got him checked in.  We checked out at 5:30 a.m. the next morning and that was all we knew.  The manager had then figured out what had happened: They created a new reservation for my husband and then charged me for a NO SHOW on my reservation.  The third charge was the pre-authorization that showed $220!  Let me re-cap:  They charged me 2 TIMES FOR THE ROOM and screwed up the check in.  THEN... they neglected to let us know that the pre-authorization and the room cost would be charged in the same amount on the same day of check in!  They also charged us for parking!  We had already parked our car in a parking garage and did not park with them!   The manager acted as if it was my husbands fault for creating a new reservation.   I assured her that he absolutely knew that we had a reservation and wouldn't have created a new reservation that it must have been her staff that messed up!    She credited my account for the no-show; told me that the pre-authorization takes 7 business days to fall off of the account; and then credited me for the parking.  She did credit back all fraudulent charges to our account!  However; she can never replace what we lost on our honeymoon all because of their screw ups and neglect in informing us about the pre-authorization and room charge on the same day!  (Basically it showed up twice in one day right after another... which makes no sense... usually a pre-authorization is charged to hold the money and then the balance is updated... like when you leave a tip at a restaurant... not two separate charges!).  Ridiculous!! [REVIEW_17] Always delicious food and great service!! A+ The owner is a delight and really cares about his customers and food that is served. So glad he opened in Land O Lakes!! [REVIEW_18] I finally got to try them. Wow..they did a great job with the remodle. I loved the mushroom cheese steak [REVIEW_19] I'm not into beer so I can't speak for their product; but I had a very good lunch there one weekend. My friend's pizza order got mixed up and our wonderful server took a few bucks off (even though the pizza was still delicious). [REVIEW_20] I've been here a few times now (once just recently during devour) and have thoroughly enjoyed my experience. The guac is fantastic; reminds me a bit of festiva's though less heat. Get the tamal corn cakes - love the hint of sweet you get in addition to the savory meat. I also absolutely love their green rice. They have good drink options though I've only had the sangria and the house marg. And finally; the price point is appropriate. I will keep coming back here - I hear brunch is excellent!",15
95,"[REVIEW_1] Worst experience ever!!!!   I stood in line today for 1 hour and 20 minutes for 1 shot. They the walked up in front of me and closed the line. Told me they were done and leaving. There were 60 people behind me outraged as well. F*** this place [REVIEW_2] The Red Pony was without a doubt a hit!  My wife and I held our rehearsal dinner there; with a group of 30 people!  Good food; good drinks; and great service made the night an absolute success; and there were smiles on the faces of every single person there.  The staff went out of there way to make us feel at home and see that our every wish and desire was satisfied.  Kari was invaluable in helping us set up our menu and coordinating the dinner.  She even put together custom menus with our selections and our names!  She also saw to it that our party had our own secluded portion of the upstairs so we could all celebrate together without interruption from other guests (or more likely; without us interrupting the others!). It was perfect.  The building is gorgeous; the decor is choice; and the artwork is beautiful.  Of course; I'm sure you're wondering about the food. No worries there.  In the skilled and capable hands of the chef; Dwight; our taste buds were delighted and our stomachs full.  All of the food - appetizers; salads; entrees; and desserts were all unique; all delectable; and all a feast.  There wasn't a disappointed mouth in the room. It was spectacular.  All in all; it was a lively celebration that neither I nor any of our guests will soon forget.  I can't recommend highly enough the Red Pony for your large party; or even for your small dinner for two (done that too!).  I've dealt with a number of the staff and sampled a variety of the dishes; and there is absolutely no way you can go wrong here. [REVIEW_3] They sat us within 5 minutes and then took 40 minutes to even bring out sodas. The table next to us had the same server and got their good before their beverages came out. After almost an hour there with no drinks we tracked down a manager who told us our good never even got entered. I'm on my honeymoon and the friend we were there with had a date to make. Appetizer was the only thing to make it out and was decent boneless wings. Even with the manager begging us to let her get our food together free and not walk out; the service was beyond dismal and slow. First and last time coming to a Beef's. Made us all late. If we had waited at our table for the food we would have made our year anniversary before it came out. Better choices for food elsewhere. Avoid this place at all costs [REVIEW_4] Yes; there are vegan options in University City; you just have to know where to look for them. MexiCali has a number of great options.  Many options here can be made vegan by holding the cheese. I absolutely adore the marinated tofu burrito. The tofu has a wonderfully chewy texture; and along with the black beans; the meal packs a protein-filled punch that will leave you full well past dinner-time; should you choose to finish it.  The sweet potato and plantain burrito is purportedly dairy-free; and it's another delicious; filling vegan option. The veggie tacos come with a spicier version of the sweet potato; the marinated tofu and some cabbage on doubled corn tortillas. The tacos are not as filling as the burritos; but they're a delicious lighter option. Finally; a fourth option for vegans: the guacamole burrito. They homemade guac is to-die-for delicious.   I end up at MexiCali about once a week. I've been going since they were just a lunch truck 8 years back. There's often a line at the restaurant; but this place has been around for years and they have a great system to get you your burrito in a very timely manner. [REVIEW_5] Hated this place I went in to try an egg roll and get a sushi roll and both were bad the egg was horrible and the sushi was chewy so I wasnt surprised that I was the only one there [REVIEW_6] Tried this place due to the high rating on Yelp.  This is one of the few times where I completely disagree with the general Yelp ratings.  I ordered some carne asada; shrimp; birria tacos; and a sprite.  My sprite came with a floating ant.  Ok; whatever; just asked for a new one.  Went to the restroom to wash my hand before eating.  ONE of the WORST bathrooms I've been in.  It smelled like it hadn't been cleaned in days.  Overall just dirty.  Got the tacos.  The shrimp taco was decent.  The birria was super dry and tough.  Lacking any flavor.  The carne asada was the worst.  Also dry; but tasted like old stale meat.  Gross!  Won't be coming back here again. [REVIEW_7] Granted they got me my prism film for my glasses; and I went through a different optometrist for the frame. I brought my glasses in. The woman assisting me had me put the film on to measure it. Got that cleared up. Then she comes back 10 minutes later to tell me all done and it will be $35. Not bad price... but when she cut it she didn't bother to tell me she didn't cut them to actually fit my whole frame.   I showed her how she cut them incorrectly; and they look shattered on the sides bc of her cut job. Please do not make me pay for something and have it look like I can't afford a proper lense bc you felt like not doing your job properly.  I would give it one more star bc they have a good glasses selection [REVIEW_8] I am a regular at this Scotty's location.  I have been to all but one Scotty's (Bloomington); and this one is the cleanest and the friendliest.  The manager always comes over to greet us; and he and my pop go at it over what school is better purdue or IU.  It's great for him to have someone like that to nit pick with.  There is a kids place as well.  I don't recommend you sit over there if you are trying to hear the game; or your partner.  I love this place.  I rave about it to friends about how much better it is than downtown; 96 or even three wise.  One gripe...the French press coffee would be much better if you ground the beans more coarse.  My mom always gets grounds in her cup...even after waiting the recommended time.  If you did that; it would be perfect!  Thanks! [REVIEW_9] I've been here a handful of times and it's always because I don't have time to go to VN Nails near Costco where I prefer to go (they get 5 stars from me).  Kiwi Nail has always done a cheap job trying to take shortcuts wherever possible.  But today I've had it and will never go back!  After getting the typical shabby job on a fill with French tips;  I accidentally smudged two nails really badly.  They needed to be repainted and I asked her to do so... I even offered to pay extra.  The nail tech came over to look and she pressed the clumps back down and painted right back over the mess (didn't even keep the paint in the lines) then slathered so much varnish over the train wreck that it was literally dripping down my finger. After my nails were dry enough to leave;  another tech rang me up and the receipt had no place for a tip.  When I asked;  he told me I had to pay tips in cash... Well it's lucky for me I didn't have any cash.  He said I will have to tip her next time.  NEXT TIME??!!  yeah right!  There will be no next time! Save yourself the hassle and don't bother with this d@mn place! [REVIEW_10] I had heard good things about Fresh Produce but I have to say I was not impressed. I noticed that my sunflowers and blueberries were moldy upon arriving home.  The tomatoes there were all bruised and mushy.  The only thing I think that I might be happy with are my apples.  Not to mention; the woman that rang me up threw around my produce and bruised it all up.  I won't be back. [REVIEW_11] Food showed up cold; salmon was raw inside; plastic in the dessert; fatty lamb chops and some sort of stringy thing at the bottom of my wine glass!! The service was great though. [REVIEW_12] Made an appointment on line at 12:30 on a Sunday for 2 pm They claim they do same day service. Ride up there and am told ""it's better to call because then they can see if the guys who do diagnostics are in."" They were not there. Really? I posted in the appointment comments what the problem was (why not notify me you can't do the work before I drive there in a car that may brake down) and what mechanic can't run a diagnostic? Doesn't the machine do it for you? Clowns and jokers  Stay away. Lying lumps of crap. [REVIEW_13] This place is still unbeatable. Inexpensive; INCREDIBLE-tasting; whole-ingredient ice cream is where it's at.   The staff is great and the portions are enormous. Love these guys! [REVIEW_14] Staff member wouldn't let us use guest pass on our first time there. He said our only option was to buy at least a one day pass for $15/person. LOL. Went to Retro fitness for free trial; better equipment and environment:) [REVIEW_15] I know that Pi is a popular place; and that it gets packed in the loop; especially on Friday and Saturday nights.  Since they don't take reservations for 2 people; and being the smart yelper that I am; I called first to check on the wait.  They said that by the time I came in; there would be no wait; especially because the concert at the Pageant was about to start.  So the bf and I headed down there 10 min later; and he dropped me off so I wouldn't have to walk in the cold (what a gentleman).  I walked in; and the snooty hostesses told me there was a 40 min wait.  Um there is NO WAY all of those people just showed up in 10 min.  Clearly someone fudged the truth to get me to come in.  And there wasn't a single seat or place to stand in the bar or the tiny waiting area.  I tried to call him to tell him not to park and walk down (he would probably have to walk pretty far) but he wasn't paying attention to his phone; so he never got the message.   He walked in; took one look; and I knew we were both on the same page.  I politely told the hostesses that they could cross off our name; and then waited by the door while he pulled the car around.  They proceeded to stare at me very obviously and whisper during this time; until I left; which  is bad business; whether you're a catty hostess that still thinks she is in high school (or maybe still is); or a hostess raving about how fabulous my outfit is.  Either way girls; it's rude.  Don't get me wrong...the pizza here is good.  But it's no mystic pizza.  And it isn't the only pizza place around.  This story has a happy ending though.  We went to Dewey's; were promptly seated; experienced the best service there; as we always do; and left with full bellies; probably way before we would've even gotten our pizza at Pi.   Never again. [REVIEW_16] I absolutely love Dorignac's. Their selection is amazing; and their cafe is delicious! Their alcohol section is very extensive and reasonably priced. They carry beer; wine; and liquor - a one stop shop! In fact; the whole store is priced pretty well. They have a good variety of foods; I eat Paleo a lot; and their Paleo options are good. Dorignac's is a little out of the way for me since I live in Broadmoor; but if I'm in Metairie for errands; I definitely get my groceries here. [REVIEW_17] I've been here many times and I always come back. Great location! The service however is touch and go. It's also noteworthy that I didn't see any African American servers or bartenders. The food is good; but not great; and I haven't seen a mouse the last couple times I've been. Enjoy! [REVIEW_18] Only giving one star because I'm required to give A star in order to leave a review.   First; rude employees. We were never greeted; never acknowledged; while multiple employees came to the station in front of us and then walked away. No one even looked up at us. As we were about to walk out; someone finally stood there and looked at us. Not sure if she actually said anything; but we gave her our order anyway.   Food quality was BAD! The pinto beans were cold. The brisket was not warm; but I wouldn't call them quite cold. I looked for their health score but didn't see it posted anywhere. Maybe the lack of one should have been a sign.  Yeah; we won't be back. Like ever. With so many other restaurants in this shopping center; there are too many good choice to settle for food and service this bad. Save yourself the trouble and go next door to Panera; or Fulins; or Longhorn. Heck; even go buy you a candy bar from Target before choosing to eat here. You'll be glad you did. [REVIEW_19] Poor service and overpriced hookah. Flavors are from star buzz but charge about 30-50% more than most places. They charge for more coals when they burn out. Food wasn't great either. Definitely wouldn't come here again. [REVIEW_20] As soon as you walk in to the dental spa; you are greeted by a wonderful staff of professionals. A first class dental office with a expert dentist; Dr Harold Yaffe      It is very easy to see that with the professionalism of Dr Yaffe; and a great staff ; you are at one of the top dental practices in the USA..... It always starts with the top and that is Dr Yaffe and his great staff follows  his lead .... Ron S",6
96,"[REVIEW_1] Nothing bittersweet about this establishment! An absolute treasure in the warehouse district! The almond petit four and red velvet cheesecake were insanely delicious and I would go back every day if I could. I also had an iced almond milk latte and it beat the chain coffee places. The cakes looked wonderful and the staff was super friendly. Go Check It Out !!! You won't be disappointed! [REVIEW_2] All I have to say is that Epcot's Mexico had better tacos than this authentic Mexican joint.  And that's pretty disappointing.  The meat was mildly warm and wasn't seasoned well enough. The beans and rice were bland as well. They were out of steak; so we mistakenly tried pork skin. Imagine eating diced slugs stuffed in a soft tortilla that keeps falling apart. Now pretend that moment in time never happened and you didn't waste your money on something that traumatizing.  Yeah...not as easy as you'd think.  I was really looking forward to the hole-in-the-wall authenticity; but I was sorely lead astray by previous reviews of this place.  Just don't do it. [REVIEW_3] Had salmon burger that was delicious. Server Emily was great. Saturday morning early without much of a crowd. Truffle fries really good. [REVIEW_4] I'm not particularly a fan of the Century Hospitality restaurants and I hadn't been to a Deluxe BB location in a few years so I decided to give it another shot the other week.   The atmosphere is cool but when you bite into the burger it is such a let down. Their overpriced burgers (and sides) are so disappointing that it brings tears to my eyes. Nobody in my party enjoyed their eats and nobody would come back.   The burgers sounds delicious from the description but in reality they are boring; dry; and void of any sort of flavor. I don't know how the Century Group can keep these locations afloat let alone keep expanding.   It's really not that hard to make even a decent burger and somehow Deluxe Burger Bar fails. DO NOT GO. [REVIEW_5] One of the best burgers I've ever had! Village Whiskey has high-quality meat; great preparation; and awesome sides -- it's my favorite burger place in downtown Philly.   The aioli and fries are delicious; too. Last time I tried truffled cauliflower; I'm not usually a huge fan of picked foods; but it was fantastic! The cauliflowers and carrots were crispy; and the juice had a light but very tasty flavor. I would definitely order it again.   The one catch: it is pretty expensive. Probably place you would go to for an especially fun or nice meal; but might not be able to afford each week.   The decor is cozy and up-scale; with small round tables surrounded by tall couches to sit on. You can hang up your coat when you enter the door; and the hostess stands behind a large wooden whiskey barrel. It's a small restaurant; so it's better for dinner with a few friends or a date than large groups. The waiters are very friendly and attentive; and service is quick. All in all; a very pleasant dining experience! [REVIEW_6] So I'm not sure what the big deal is over this place. Your Clarksville Tn location has nothing but positive reviews. We were looking forward to having a nice family dinner at your Springfield location tonight. However that sadly did not happen my husband found his food bland and lacking seasoning of any kind he ordered just a simple cheeseburger. And I ordered your salmon with a Baked potato and garden salad. My Salmon was RAW in the middle and I don't mean just slightly pink there was a good half a inch to a inch worth of RAW salmon I sent it back to be recooked. Well when it came back out it was clear my dinner had been place in most likely a Microwave  the ends that I had pulled apart for my 8 year old to eat prior to realizing the fish was RAW  were now so dry and curled over. When I asked the manager who brought me my food back if they microwaved my fish I was told NO. Problem here my fish came back to me the exact way I sent it to be recooked nothing on the plate was out of place. My husband and I are truly disappointed we had high hopes for PBODY'S. [REVIEW_7] I have been seeing Maria @ Rescue for brow tint and thread for a few months now. She has totally transformed my brows! They have gone from too light and sparse to my ideal eyebrow. I look forward to them getting better and better each time I see her. She is such a kind and warm person; I always feel great after I leave her chair. Thanks Maria! [REVIEW_8] Great place with good food my wife and daughter love it as well. Everything we order is hot and fresh can be slow at times when busy but the food is worth the wait [REVIEW_9] Went for my birthday dinner. First time dining and was in the mood for delicious Greek food. Needless to say; I was not disappointed. The food was second to none and service was impeccable. Absolutely will recommend to anyone wanting great Greek food with amazing service. If you have the time; it is worth your while to enjoy a meal at this fabulous dining establishment! [REVIEW_10] Ah! Cally's.   The owner is really what makes this place so special and unique. If you ever have the opportunity to chat it up; please take it!  Homemade tomato soup and grilled cheese? Mmmm; this lunch was amazing! I'll definitely be seeing more of Cally! [REVIEW_11] Our first walking tour in New Orleans and it was very informative! Michael; our guide; was very entertaining and knowledgeable! We highly recommend it next time your in NOLA [REVIEW_12] Worst sales man ever. I don't remember his name since he gave us someone else's business card. My girlfriend and I went into look at the jeep renegade and compare it to the patriot. The salesman shows us to a base model patriot let's us take it out awkwardly sits in the back and gives us one word answers on all our questions. I asked about fuel economy and he flat out lied said the car gets well over 30 mpg which it does not. Then tells us there are some great incentives on this car but doesn't explain what they are or how much they are. We come back not really liking the car he asks us how much we want to spend we say a low number he laughs and walks away and says to look online at their used cars and come back. We ask to see the car we came to see and he dosent even acknowledge our request;I asked about a truck I was interested in and he wouldn't even let me look at it or take it for a test drive. This is the worst customer service I have ever received we could have possibly bought two cars from this dealership but I will be taking my business elsewhere.   It sounds like another reviewer had issues with the same sales man; he should really be fired for making this business look so bad. [REVIEW_13] One of our favorite breakfast spots! Almost always a small wait but they are on top of their service and turn tables quickly. The food is fresh and amazing - huge portions. Ask for Tina - personality plus and a great server! Makes breakfast/brunch very enjoyable! [REVIEW_14] I could just copy and paste the majority of the reviews into this box; but I guess I will share my experience first hand.  At first; I thought it was a farmers market. I texted my friend asking her what time we should go so I knew when to cook dinner and she told me to hold off dinner - I was going to get stuffed at this event.  She was dead wrong.  When we arrived around 7:30 we found it super packed. Long long times; tight crowds; lots of dogs and babies. We circled the event trying to pick out which line we were going to devote our entire night to standing in; and decided on the Jamaican truck. After an hour of standing in line; and having other line go-ers friends casually jip us; we finally made it to the front to order only to have the vendor announce they were out of all of my meal options.  So you know what I had for dinner the evening of Night Market? A bag of chips from CVS.  This event had it's potential. But I guess they were not counting on the ridiculous horde of hungry people. Most trucks were placing ""SOLD OUT"" signs just as we were arriving. There were very few vegetarian/vegan options... (actually; don't believe any food vendors had vegan options). Hopefully next time they will be able to work out their kinks. [REVIEW_15] Sunday not so fun day at Schlafly. Came in; cool music live outside. Go inside to grab a bite and drink.  We sat inside for around 15 minutes; no server. They had like 4 bartenders; two waitresses and 2 bar backs. Yet; no one even approached.   I do not recommend maplewood on Sunday at all. Bad experience. [REVIEW_16] I ordered the chicken stew; it was Tasteless chicken; it was a fried chicken possibly a leftover; that was thrown into a pot and made it into a stew.  If I wanted leftovers; I would have eaten at home.  Gross; still feel like I have to throw up. [REVIEW_17] This place moved locations and when I placed a call in order the guy on the phone didn't even tell me or give me a heads up! I called to find out the new location and he gave me wrong directions! I was super bummed! No thanks! There is a ton of great Thai places in town with better service! [REVIEW_18] Fantastic burgers and great selection of craft beers. VERY friendly environment. [REVIEW_19] I adore In-N OUt burgers - get them animal style or try them in a lettuce wrap (protein style).  They've got a special menu not listed (http://www.in-n-out.com) and their fries are amazing - you can actually taste the potato in them.  Their menu is very basic but it's all you need - burgers; fries; and shakes. [REVIEW_20] Their salsa was flavorless. To many green peppers in the fijitas compared to the onion and the chicken was dry.  Had to ask for more torrtias because the first ones where dried out. The kid who brought out the food didn't warn is how hot the plates where. My food was just pay. And by the way no Tolet seat in the men's room.",11
97,"[REVIEW_1] Buying a car at Thoroughbred was the easiest experience I've ever had at a dealership; and I've bought and leased cars all over the country.    Michelle Lipinski and Rod Gillis made this transaction as simple as it possibly could have been.  I found Michelle through TrueCar; and she offered a discount even deeper than what TrueCar told me Thoroughbred would give me.    I'm still astounded by how easy it was to get a price that was way cheaper than what I expected.  The whole thing took less than an hour.  Seriously; I don't have a single complaint.    If you want a completely hassle-free experience AND the best price you'll find anywhere; email Michele.  She's the only person I ever want to buy a car from; for the rest of my life! [REVIEW_2] I could not be happier with choosing the Riviera Mansion for our wedding venue. My husband and I met in Santa Barbara so it was only fitting that we got married in a place that reminded us of where it all began. One of the things I loved about the venue is it's rich history in Santa Barbara and how beautifully the architecture and gardens photograph. The staff at the Riviera Mansion are top notch and really created a premium experience for us; from the first email we sent to Breanna to the walk-through; the tasting; rehearsal and the wedding day itself! We felt so well taken care of throughout the night- they checked in on my husband and I and our parents throughout the night to ensure we had our favorite drink in hand; got to taste all of the appetizers by putting a special plate at our dinner table and kept our champagne topped off for all of the toasts. One of the big selling points for us was that the venue included a lot of the basics like catering; bar; dinner rentals; bride & groom suites; and different ceremony and reception sites. I was grateful to be able to get ready; take photos; have a light lunch before the wedding all onsite. The venue itself is BEAUTIFUL and so dreamy. It was just the right amount of space and with all of the different room kept things interesting for our guests and allowed people to spread out across the different rooms and patios. I would highly recommend the Riviera Mansion to anyone looking for a classy; iconic and romantic wedding venue in Santa Barbara. [REVIEW_3] The staff is so so sweet and friendly and really makes this place as fantastic as it is. The coffee is great; and their amazing grilled cheese and baked goods make for a great afternoon bite. They have a good selection of tea and a great atmosphere -- also try their pizza place Capo Fitto in old city if you want a fabulous dinner [REVIEW_4] I got the bazooka toast; it was amazing! A little bit pricey but totally worth it. So good it inspired me to give my first yelp review :) [REVIEW_5] Walked up with a group to serve 10 - parents and kids.  After trying to get someone to come to walk up window; we left because they were ignoring us 5-10 minutes and no one else was waiting for walk up service. [REVIEW_6] After spending the night at a friend's place in NoLibs; I was in search of a place to grab breakfast and coffee; so I gave Red Cup Café a shot.  I settled on a coffee and an egg and cheese sandwich on an English muffin.  The café definitely lives up to its name in that hot beverages are served in red mugs; and the atmosphere is homey and low-key; just like the corner coffee shops we all know and love.  Much to my delight; as I was enjoying my breakfast (which was well prepared; by the way); the very friendly owner (?) Rick made conversation with me and we chatted for a good while; since it seemed to be pretty slow for a Monday morning.  Will definitely be back next time I am in the neighborhood! [REVIEW_7] If your looking for great Tex mex in west chase look no farther than  Tijuana Flats great food and great staff. [REVIEW_8] I went to Audio Itch to get my windows tinted (with warranty) and a front bumper camera with rear mirror display. Their work was reasonably priced; clean; quick; and professional. They have a mini movie theater waiting room with comfortable lounge chairs. I will be taking my cars here from now on. [REVIEW_9] Ang is a lovely woman and fantastic therapist. Highly recommend! [REVIEW_10] Romantic; revolutionary; eclectic; chic. I can go on. The sad part is I only came in here for dessert and drinks! You want a cocktail do ya?! Well; you've stumbled on the right place. They have more or less a book full of choices to pick from. On this night; I wanted something of the red wine variety. They have wines from all over the world.   The sommelier leaves no stones unturned in terms of finding abstract wine to bring to the table. I finished my night with a glass of port accompanied by the the pie in a jar. A splendid combo that I had to pat myself on the back for. While I'm at it; I'll pat Olio on the back too. Bravo! [REVIEW_11] I went in today because of neck and shoulder pain. Marisa was awesome. I've never experienced a massage like this before. She did a deep tissue massage and stretched my body as well. I already feel better and it's 5 hours later. I'm definitely going back to her soon! [REVIEW_12] A great place to listen to live music and have an afternoon cocktail or three. The hodgepodge seating in the backyard gave it a fun; quirky feel and the drinks were delicious and affordable  (but happy hour helped; too). The cheese plate was also quite yums in the tums. Bacchanal is a fun; memorable; tasty way to spend a day. [REVIEW_13] Absolutely THE BEST bike shop in Tucson for the serious cyclist. If you're looking for high-end anything I would be really surprised if Fair Wheel didn't have it in stock (or if they didn't have it in stock; they could get it for you relatively quickly). The staff are extremely helpful and attentive. And if you're active in the local scene you could easily waste an hour in the shop just talking about bikes and bike racing. A true gem in Tucson. [REVIEW_14] Terrible. Overrun with pretentious yuppies; babies and dogs. No point in standing in line for small portions that are overpriced. I left and had dinner elsewhere. Good idea; terrible execution. [REVIEW_15] This is some good motherfuckin ice cream.  Positive: +Tell me you're serving bananas foster today! +Freshly made waffle cones +Establishment doesn't look like a fucking kindergarden.  I can eat ice cream and still feel like an adult +Owner is a Harvard grad; but isn't a stuck up asshole.  Actually seems pretty down to earth and can hold a conversation with the layman.  Negative: -I'm reaching; but I kinda wish this place was located by the movie theater.  Would be nice to park once and make this part of an evening out.  The only time I really think about this place is after rolling out of Publix and by then I've already got bags of frozen food thawing out and dont have time for ice cream.  Not even some bad ass ice cream.  Hey... even 5 star joints could use some constructive criticism [REVIEW_16] 3 calls to say when they'd come never happened. Our ""Guaranteed morning appointment"" became ""we'll try to get there in the morning"". Nobody can reach the installers; no management is available on the weekends; ""printing problems have delayed the ability to call customers back"" (actual quote); being told to wait 10 hours on a Saturday isn't convenient; something they touted in their sales process. Salesman **Name Redacted** thank you for ""not being able to do anything"" but being happy to sell the carpet.  (message me if you'd like the salesman's name)  Morning appointment; its 2:21PM currently; no carpet. [REVIEW_17] Although the term is often overused; ""farm fresh"" truly applies here. Inventive; flavorful dishes and just-right portions amaze. A cozy dining room; friendly atmosphere and attentive service make it the perfect setting to catch up with friends and loved ones (BYO; so grab a good bottle). Try the Bloody Beet Steak! [REVIEW_18] If you are not Italian and ""from the neighborhood"" expect to get ""less than"" everything - service; time at the table you reserved because a ""regular"" wants your table; and even smaller portions than the regulars! No kidding! The food is great so I definitely recommend it for that; but everything else around the food was; well; unpleasant (and I am being polite)! It's clear the owners don't care about generating new clientele from outside the neighborhood. Oh well; their loss. The owners should take note of the zillions of other restaurants within walking distance. [REVIEW_19] Nice merchandising in the lobby.  Fantastic breakfast for the morning after brewery crawls.   They had trouble with the taps when we went; but made up for it in heavy pours.   The beer selection makes flights a little hard to choose from; so go more than once to work through the brews. You won't be sorry. [REVIEW_20] This is a great market. The beat I've been to in the city.   The mixture of stalls is wonderful; between fresh vegetables; meat; eggs; as well as farm produce like cheese; honey; and cider; and baked goods; fresh teas and coffees (available iced for those summer days).   The Big Cheese is great -- there's always a line of people hungry for possibly the beat grilled cheese I've ever tasted. I also enjoyed scones and shortbread from Queen's Cuisine. Bread from Companion Bakery is a must; as are popsicles from Whisk.   There's a great atmosphere here on a Saturday morning. I also can recommend the free yoga (with a donation). A great teacher and good atmosphere.",16
98,"[REVIEW_1] I know that Pi is a popular place; and that it gets packed in the loop; especially on Friday and Saturday nights.  Since they don't take reservations for 2 people; and being the smart yelper that I am; I called first to check on the wait.  They said that by the time I came in; there would be no wait; especially because the concert at the Pageant was about to start.  So the bf and I headed down there 10 min later; and he dropped me off so I wouldn't have to walk in the cold (what a gentleman).  I walked in; and the snooty hostesses told me there was a 40 min wait.  Um there is NO WAY all of those people just showed up in 10 min.  Clearly someone fudged the truth to get me to come in.  And there wasn't a single seat or place to stand in the bar or the tiny waiting area.  I tried to call him to tell him not to park and walk down (he would probably have to walk pretty far) but he wasn't paying attention to his phone; so he never got the message.   He walked in; took one look; and I knew we were both on the same page.  I politely told the hostesses that they could cross off our name; and then waited by the door while he pulled the car around.  They proceeded to stare at me very obviously and whisper during this time; until I left; which  is bad business; whether you're a catty hostess that still thinks she is in high school (or maybe still is); or a hostess raving about how fabulous my outfit is.  Either way girls; it's rude.  Don't get me wrong...the pizza here is good.  But it's no mystic pizza.  And it isn't the only pizza place around.  This story has a happy ending though.  We went to Dewey's; were promptly seated; experienced the best service there; as we always do; and left with full bellies; probably way before we would've even gotten our pizza at Pi.   Never again. [REVIEW_2] Nope nope and nope again Rude hostess  Always some nonesense with seating and sushi is mediocre at best...  yes it's dirt cheap but it's also dirt food & dirt service  Oh the kicker - ginger smells like amonia Gave this place a couple tries  Never again [REVIEW_3] We tried to stop in and wait for a table for the second night in a row. The hostess was utterly useless. She refused to tell us how many tables were in front of us; rough estimate of how long it would be (other than a while); and wouldn't tell us how long a to go order would be. There were empty tables everywhere so I didn't understand why there was such a long wait.   Since we did eat there the night before and we were trying to go back; the food was good. Best cheesecake my fiancé ever had. My steak was cooked well and flavorful. My baked potato was cold when it came out. Bread was yummy. But the service sucks so bad; I wouldn't recommend it. [REVIEW_4] Horrible food.  Bread sticks totally dry. Mozzarella sticks more salty than salt itself. And the worst tasting; bland; fettuccine alfredo ever.  Gave it a try despite the 1.5 stars but shouldn't have risked it. Wish I could give them a zero. [REVIEW_5] Jon Butler was a pleasure to work with in buying a new mattress! Highly recommend going in to see him specifically. The store is clean and easy to navigate w a great selection! Jon made the whole process quick and easy which was important to me. Thank you Jon- I'll be back for sure! [REVIEW_6] First time coming here and honestly one of the best ice cream shops in Tampa! Such a cool and different style of serving ice cream and the choice of flavors sounded great. Will be coming back soon! [REVIEW_7] Absolutely horrible service; cold soup and my salad was drenched in dressing. The iceberg lettece was browning; soggy and pickled.  This place should not even get 1 star. [REVIEW_8] The staff was super nice and let us try some samples. It looked nice and clean in there! They have all the speciality favors out in the front and the standard flavors are in the back. I really loved my waffle cone with chocolate chip ice cream! The Cookie Monster ice cream was good too! [REVIEW_9] So I went to this location because I had the feeling that this location would not try to get over and be perfectly honest...I went there for a noise in my steering wheel. They told me they didn't find anything wrong. So I picked my car up; noise still there. I pointed it out they put it right up and told me it was my rack pinon  costing around $1;500 -$1;800 dollars with labor; parts; etc. Mind you I just brought my car probably three weeks ago. I said scratch that and took it to the Hyundai dealer and got the car fully inspected. I did not; I repeat did not need a new rack and pinon!!!! It was my coupler or however you spell it in the steer wheel that was worn out. Want to know how much it cost me? $0.00 under warranty. Now if I was naive I would have handed over that money to Pep Boys for no reason. I don't know if they were trying to take advantage because I am a woman but I wasn't for it. I won't be returning because of the misinformation. Nice customer service though! That's not enough. [REVIEW_10] If you value your eyes (and your sanity!) please do not get an eye exam here.  First; the equipment they have appears to be from the 80s (florescent eye drops and all!). I don't trust it (or the doctor) at all.    Second; this doctor's interest is mainly in selling you things you don't need or want.  She tried to get me to buys some expensive eye drops so my eyes would not be dry (I never said my eyes were dry!).  Then; she tried to get me to change my contact lens brand; even though I told her I had been very happy with my current brand for years. She even wrote my main prescription for her brand of choice and added a side note (that you could barely read) of the different prescription if I want to order my brand.  Obviously she has some incentive to push her brand.   Finally; my prescription was actually wrong. She changed things in my prescription (not just the power) that had stayed the same for many many years. And did not explain why.  And all this is after I waited 30 minutes after my appointment time. I wish I had left.  I will be paying out of pocket to get another eye exam elsewhere before I order any contact lenses.  I hate writing such a negative review; but this doctor should really be avoided. [REVIEW_11] I came here for lunch and was very disappointed.  Bland and expensive for the amount and quality of food we received.  Lukewarm; nearly tasteless (how can Mexican food be tasteless???) and a total waste of my lunch hour.  Meh.  Do yourself a favor and support the many authentic; locally owned; non-chain Mexican restaurants.  I was wishing that I had gone to Mi Pueblo instead....... [REVIEW_12] My husband and I have been renting from milpas rental for many years now. If I could give it 6 stars I would. They have anything you can imagine to rent. From scissor lifts to great quality power tools. Their fleet of equipment is always in top shape and never outdated. You not only get amazing customer service every time; but definitely the lowest prices around. Their staff is super knowledgeable and super friendly. When we had our wedding a few years back; we needed extra power for lighting and kitchen equipment; and they were so helpful with leading us towards what size cord we needed and even connectors for all of the lighting.  Keep up the good work Milpas Rental! [REVIEW_13] Best sushi place in the area! I've been to Hachi multiple times and the service is always top-notch. Great lunch prices and options! Lunch comes with soup and salad; which is rare for this area. The salad is great; with fresh greens (not romaine; or iceberg) and GREAT ginger dressing. It's perfect.   There are many options for the sushi lunches and all great. My mother is in love with the salmon tempura and my boyfriend is obsessed with the mushroom shiitake. He is vegetarian and they have multiple sushi options for him.  The spicy mayo is fantastic; FYI.   The bento boxes are great and filling since they give you a lot of food!! Plus it's yummy. I recommend the shrimp teriyaki.   Usually at the end of the meal; they bring out oranges and pineapple; which is a nice touch.   I have not been there for dinner; only lunch since they have great deals. Go between 11:30 am - 3:30 pm since that is when the lunch specials are. [REVIEW_14] After getting my car damaged in a minor hit and run; I was told that Calvin's does great work at an affordable price. I used to live very close to the shop and was happy I could give my old neighborhood's shop some business. I called ahead and set a time; Calvin was very nice and professional. When I got there; he helped me right away. He started doing the estimate and started asking questions. While talking; I told him I already had a claim in for the damage. He immediately changed his tone; refusing to finish the estimate. Insisting my insurance company would not accept his estimate. This was very confusing since I already had my insurance company's estimate and the cash was in my account. I tried to explain it to him but he wouldn't listen to what I was saying. This was just a bad experience. [REVIEW_15] Whole family got sick after eating here. The frozen yogurt was pretty but did not taste good. Would not go here again or recommend it. [REVIEW_16] My husband and I went here right before they were closing because we were in the neighborhood and needed some items for a recipe we were planning to make the next day.  I was super disappointed in this food outlet.  The meat section looked AWFUL; most of the meat was turning brown and the whole back of the store smelled like rotten food.  Like I said; it was around closing time; but it totally turned me off and gave me a ""gut feeling"" that I shouldn't buy anything from this store.  The layout was also a bit unorganized.  I will not be back. [REVIEW_17] Best desserts ever! Dark and sinister is AMAZING. Really anything with that uses the chocolate ice cream is my favorite. [REVIEW_18] When I think about the time I spent waiting for the server to arrive; for a drinkable cup of coffee to replace the one that tasted like it has been brewed with a goat's hoof; and to digest the hard lump of cheese and egg that was my breakfast; I really wish I had chosen instead to stand in the line-up at Sugarbowl. [REVIEW_19] Schlafly Bottleworks is more than just a microbrewery. Yes; they do brew their own beer onsite (tours are available) and they have a nice bar area with plenty of seating.  They also have great; affordable food. I'm a big fan of their burgers; but have never ordered anything at Schlafly's that I didn't like. They also have a large outside patio area and sponsor a weekly farmer's market during the summer on their parking lot.  I appreciate that they use local sustainable food and that the entire building was smoke free (even the bar) before the smoking ban went into place. They keep a fire going outside all winter in the patio space which gives the smokers a warm place to huddle.   I've also been to several events with the back room with it's own bar and their bartenders will let you taste the beer until you find one you like. [REVIEW_20] This restaurant is over rated. My family went because we were new to the area and have heard great things. They are very packed; hardly any parking and you always have to make a reservation. I thought I would be happy with the food. However; when we went for dinner the menu had some food that sounded good; but my husband and I struggled to find something that we liked. We did get the California roll and that was good; but we were not impressed with the teriyaki chicken. It seems like our experience is one of the few; but personally we will not be going back again.",7
99,"[REVIEW_1] Terrible customer service! Avoid this place. They have a new policy to not help you with any set up of your phone. (My husband called corporate to ask about this policy and they said that they should have helped out.) They sent me home with the wrong instructions for setting up my phone on my own. It's been three weeks since I switched to Verizon and my phone still is not set up correctly. This place is a waste of time and is extremely frustrating . I wish I never switched to Verizon. [REVIEW_2] Never Ender boutique is a hidden charming place located on Thoma; just west of Center street. It's a cute 1930's house that has been transformed into a boutique and art gallery. The items they carry are one-of-a-kind. Not your typical conforming wares. They carry items that are mostly handmade; and all are made in USA. They focus on carrying items made by artists. The owner; Melanie Crane loves the artists; and carefully selects which items to carry! You will NOT find your usual and typical jewelry; clothing or art. It is all unique with its own identity. Do yourself a favor - do NOT miss visiting this store! I can guarantee you it will not be your last visit. Trust me! [REVIEW_3] I will never eat there again. I ordered chicken Parmesan and after about four bites I realized my chicken was raw!  The manager Gary  said this hardly ever happens. What? Like it was a common occurrence. This place will never last. I ignored a good friends advice saying he had a bad meal there. Next time I will listen. [REVIEW_4] Whenever we want the best sushi in town we have to come here. We almost always get the sashimi and sushi combination; along with a couple different orders of nigiri.   Always amazing and worth the high price. [REVIEW_5] Love their food & Mimosas.  Appreciate the second location in Tucson.  Just be prepared for a bit of a wait during peak times. [REVIEW_6] I have NEVER been disappointed by them! I have tried practically the entire menu and it has all been tasty. Great portion for the price and relatively quick service considering everything is cool to order. Nice hidden jewel on the Northwest side of Naptown. [REVIEW_7] Texas Roadhouse does not give you the steak you ask for in the case. I have been here multiple times; asked for a specific steak; and have a steak come out for my meal that is a completely different steak. This is such a hoax; tourist attraction as part of the restaurants; and really dishonest. This restaurant shouldn't offer this if they cannot actually provide their customers with what they ask for. [REVIEW_8] Super disappointed in this place! Their service was nice but their breakfast burrito is almost $9 even though its advertised as $6.99 (i didnt get any additions).  I would have been ok with it except the burrito was so puny when it arrived! Almost the same size as the little burritos youd get at a cafeteria on a school campus.  By comparison; super cucas and daily grind are both substantialy larger burritos with better flavor.   From a flavor standpoint it was also subpar; and i ordered a chorizo burrito and they put in some other kind of random pork cut.   Get it together el sitio. Mexican food isn't difficult  and it shouldn't be expensive. [REVIEW_9] I have curly hair and spent too much time with stylists who cut my hair poorly.  I've found found a place which not only makes my hair bounce and flow but also does wonderful color and highlights.  As another reviewer noted; they are Deva cut professionals and are trained to cut curly hair. The work is thoughtful; thorough; and artful-I get compliments on both my color and cut. The salon is comfortable and homey; it lacks that ostentatious attitude that most salons project. The pricing is reasonable and fair--especially compared with other Main Line and Center City salons. [REVIEW_10] Best pho in Santa Barbara County.  Staff are great.   I drive 35-40 minutes for the Pho; would drive double.   Seriously tho; no more pho withdrawals.       Thanks Phamous! [REVIEW_11] For context; I've previously always been; somewhat to my embarrassment; generally more fond of fancy/trendy donuts (do-rite in Chicago; sidecar in LA; etc) than your mom-and-pop style donut. Always thought the high-quality ingredients and inspired flavor combinations made the calories more worth it.   St. Louis is an anomaly. The hipster donut offerings here are a wretched disappointment. Sorry Strange; your toppings are decent; but the donuts themselves are weirdly dry and thick. Sorry Vincent Van Doughnut...actually; I'm not sorry - you should be sorry for selling me that chocolate-coffee abomination. That's the first donut I ever left unfinished. It's literally sprinkled with coffee grounds. It would take some insanely good chocolate to carry that; but instead you thinly coated the donut with some mediocre dark chocolate.  Thankfully; the anomaly works both ways. This homestyle shop has some truly excellent stuff; for insanely low prices. Chocolate icing has much more depth of flavor than your average cheap-donut-chocolate. Blueberry cakes are light; fresh; and fruity - perfectly sweet. Buttermilks are rich and satisfying. All worth coming back for; but oh; the apple fritters. Deep fried perfection.  If there exists an apple fritter better than the ones here; I will most definitely live off the things for the rest of my (likely very short) life. [REVIEW_12] I was here before once. Didn't have much of an impression. I went back again this week with my friends. We were very disappointed. We ordered this grilled whole fish. It came out in a big pot with vegetables looking like left overs. The fish was about the size of one hand; but it only had half of the fish served!!  The dish was $30. We four each took one bite and it was gone! I went home hungry! I ordered a take out for my husband. The serving size was about half of the same dish I ordered from the other Chinese restaurant . I felted being robbed. [REVIEW_13] This store has the worst customer service time and time again.   This morning I went in at 11am (when they open) and there were probably four other customers browsing the store. I turned the corner and the associate looking shocked said ""we don't open until 11."" I said it is 11 and her other associate said yeah it is 11. She then said well let me check. Comes back and said no one will be at register because they're closed. (The door to the front was open)  I asked if I could buy something and she looked at me like I was dumb and said ""ya.""   I was both confused and annoyed so I left.   Three times before this the service was also terrible. [REVIEW_14] It is hard to beat anything that can entertain you for hours and is absolutely free. I have been able to visit the museum on a few different occasions; and love the Final Friday events. The last Friday of each month brings in live music; bars set up on a couple different floors; and late night hours to enjoy the exhibits when it would normally be closed.   I am by no means a connoisseur (thank you spell check) of fine arts; and to be honest; I was expecting to be bored with the actual exhibits. For some reason I had pictured in my head that it would just be rooms and rooms of weird lines drawn on black canvases that look like a 10 year old could recreate but was instead labeled as fancy art. While there were a couple of things here that made me wonder why somebody would want to buy it; I was way wrong about what the IMA had to offer. There were fantastic paintings and sculptures in many different styles that offered something for everybody's taste. The thing that surprised me the most was how much of the IMA was dedicated to exhibits that I more expected to find in a natural history museum than an art gallery. During my visit; there were lots of artifacts from all across the world from many different time periods; and was the highlight of my visit. All of the pieces are well labeled with all of the info that you would want regarding the piece and the creator.  I have not yet had the opportunity to walk the grounds; but based on everybody I have talked to; it is something I have to do in the very near future. I look forward to making it back; and am glad that we have such a great facility right here in Indy. [REVIEW_15] Holy crap worst haircut of my life!!! I feel terrible because she was so sweet but it looks like a 5 year old took scissors and started guessing! It's so bad I can't even wear it in a ponytail or bun without having choppy (what should be layers; looks like boxes) pieces that are super uneven hanging out. My ponytail looks like someone butcher my hair and left random pieces. Beware! I get my hair cut and trimmed regularly; figured this was closer to home and I'd try it out for a quick trim. Never again. It's not blended and evening blending couldn't fix it; the haircut alone wasn't straight; my right is longer then my left with randomly boxy chops. So embarrassed of my head!!! Have to go get it fixed elsewhere. [REVIEW_16] Be careful.  This place just wants your money; not your business.  They deal only in cash and are very reluctant to take returns.  And I'm sure that they don't only take cash only from the large contractors... probably just the little guys.   They sell damaged items.  Check your stuff very well before you leave; because you will not be able to bring it back if you discover that they have slipped you the ole' damaged door!  I do not recommend this place.  Don't support them.  Not at all. [REVIEW_17] First time at HS. It was difficult getting a reservation. It always is after great reviews from patrons and the most recent 3 star out of 4 from CL. HS really steps it up for Collingswood. Once inside if you close your eyes one would think they were in a major city in the US. Love the open kitchen. Beautiful inside and out. Now for the food. Kale salad with hazelnuts was fantastic. Even if you don't like kale you will love this. Next the octopus. Perfectly done and one of the best I have tasted. This next dish they hit it out of the park and should make it permanent on the menu. Pasta cups with red meat gravy aka bolognese sauce. It was so good and had a little spice to it. And last a table share of a pork shoulder that they crisped up which was fantastic. Believe it or not our friends made a reservation for this Wednesday so we can't wait to go back. Staff was great and steered us in the right direction for ordering. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! [REVIEW_18] I have only been here on a few occasions; mostly to send the random package; I like that this location has one of the automated machine (the post office closest to me does not...)  But what I wanted to highlight was the fantastic customer service my husband and I experienced when we went here to get our passport applications submitted; the representative we worked with was awesome. She was fast; friendly and knew exactly what needed to be done so we were in and out super quick! She even gave me the follow up forms and explained what I would need to do once I changed my name; perfect. I hope every experience here in the future is just as good. She should train everyone. [REVIEW_19] It's a mandatory stop; besides the klller product I'm deeming it as excellent customer service. I called Canuli's months back in my first attempt to understand how the Korean BBQ meat Bulgogi was created. I was extremely lucky to talk to Jerry who told me what meat to use; and what would be cost efficient. He sliced down a roast for me; wrapped it separate and gave it a little citrus spray. I took it home to make the Bulgogi; I've used it for Cheesesteaks; and pepper steaks also. It's unreal. The fact that they WILL slice it for you is a gift; but mainly I understand it's labor; and he volunteered it; which simplifies to excellent customer service. I have incorporated the house of pork into my freezer stocking ventures. With that being said; it's time I also recommend what most people know (or if they don't they need to) they are famous for. The sausage; it's hands down the clean up hitter in the lineup on an all-star block of great Italian foods. I was first introduced to their hot sausage at a dinner party and my friend advised me of the location; which ultimately set the wheels in motion. It's amazing. What also is amazing is the breakfast sausage; the real deal. It's absolutely unreal; and I'll go one step further to state that I am not really a sausage fanatic. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to make their sauce (or gravy) turn heads or their in laws happy morning guests. 10/10. [REVIEW_20] Hey! This is the best place I have ever eaten at in New Orleans and quite possibly one of the best meals of my life. I have been to New Orleans numerous times and thankfully this time I have a ""local"" to roll with and this little number blew my fucking mind. I could sit here and describe it to you but it will ruin it for you. Just trust me go; eat; and have an ""if I die after this it's okay"" type of night.",12
