0,[REVIEW_1] Was here for the weekend and wanted somewhere to go get my nails done. Looked at the reviews and I was happy. Very clean and very friendly. The whole place was very nice... I would recommend this place. Will be coming back if I'm here again!!! [REVIEW_2] As an update to my previous review; we had tried the pizza tonight and it was delicious. The   crust is light; thin and tasty. The sauce is sweet and spicy. Mozzarella and provolone is the perfect combination of cheese. Just add those amazing meatballs and you have a wonderful pie! [REVIEW_3] Best Donuts in St. Pete! Highly recommend to all. The customer service is top notch and prices are great as well. My favorite is the double chocolate donut. I think I could eat about 50 of them. [REVIEW_4] Square 1682 is a hotel bar I frequent. I've been there for lunch; brunch; dinner and happy hour. The food is great; the service is excellent; and the space is upscale. There is always a nice group of people that go there. Whether they are staying at the hotel or live or work in the area; you'll always find someone nice to chat with at the bar. The very best thing about the bar is the bartender that works on Mondays. His name is Dan and he is the man! He's my favorite bartender in the city and I've been to a lot of places. He always knows just what I want and remembers my name when I go there. The only reason I go to Square 1682 on Monday's is because Dan is working. If I walk by and he's not on; I keep going. He's that good! Love him and have so many great memories at this fine establishment. [REVIEW_5] I stay at this hotel every time I come to Tarpon Springs. The hotel is nice and quiet. Minutes away from a movie theater; comedy club and tons of restaurants. Comfy beds. Free wifi. The TVs also have hdmi ports; so bring a chromecast; fire stick or game console for added entertainment. My check in was a breeze. Took less than two minutes. Jean checked me in and she was so nice for someone working the night shift at a hotel. The breakfast was great. Hot food every morning. Plenty of hot food every morning. You can eat breakfast in dining area or take it to your room like I did. I highly recommend Hampton Inn! always a great stay... Also the pool is open pretty much year round I think.,5
1,[REVIEW_1] Our son & his wife sent us the heart shaped box of chocolate covered strawberries with a 'Happy Anniversary' balloon for our 50th wedding anniversary this past Saturday. The store called to make sure we were home; the driver wished us a happy anniversary and the strawberries are still delicious and keeping well in the fridge. I would definitely send these to someone else. Well worth the price. [REVIEW_2] All I can really say is WoW.  The flavors were fantastic.  Quattro Formaggi; Crudo and Sea Salt and Rosemary.  The service was great.  The open pizza area was great to watch these guys at their work.  Beer list is awesome.  What else can I say.  Go.  Eat Pizza the way it should have always been. [REVIEW_3] This place is nothing short of astounding.  I went in for my first Brazilian and decided to get a blow-out as well.  These women are incredible in every way; from their work to their personalities. I've never felt more comfortable and relaxed under such intimidating circumstances (THANKS JENNE!).  Oh; and they're both comedians; so be ready to laugh the whole time you're here :)  Can not wait to go back! [REVIEW_4] I would recommend Twisted Twig to everyone - excellent service; very friendly; and create amazing arrangements!  You will not regret working with Jen! I reached out to a few different florist 2 weeks before my wedding. I was frantic my wedding was only 2 weeks away and didn't have a florist; even though it was a small wedding. I got a hold of Jen; who I might say was very responsive.  I got on the phone with Jen and she was so nice and very genuine. We spoke about what I was looking for and I texted her some pictures of inspiration and my dress. She asked me if there were certain flowers I was looking for and my budget. I didn't have any flowers in mind; as long as the colors are what I wanted and told her my budget. She sent me a quote; staying within my budget; noting the flowers she would use for the bouquet; boutonniere; and floral arrangements for the arch I had. It was nice that Jen works with you to stay in your budget yet still get what you want.  On the wedding day; Jen arrived at my hotel door right on time with my beautiful bouquet. The floral arrangements at the site was gorgeous also. Jen really hit the mark on what I wanted for my wedding. She also was very sweet and added some roses on the chairs by the aisle to my surprise; which was not on the quote. That was very special because it pulled the whole ceremony look together and I felt Jen really wanted everything to look perfect for me. [REVIEW_5] So I am going to come clean here up front.  I love this place.  I love the food; the casual atmosphere and the staff is professional and welcoming.   They are adjacent to my hotel every time I come to NOLA so I am here at least once per visit.   I wanted to step outside my comfort zone and try something else today for a late lunch but when I sat at the bar; ordered a glass of wine and was given the menu- I didnt see what I wanted ( I had seen it on the lunch menu).  I wanted oysters; as in welcome to NOLA - oysters.  They would not serve them at the bar so I drank my wine and left.  Here I am back at LUKE for my third meal this week.  And I got those oysters.  I also got a warm welcome; great beer and hello - happy hour!  Thank you John Besh for doing what you do.  #superstar #kingofnola,5
2,[REVIEW_1] Enjoyed my time on the Vista . I already have another cruise scheduled on the Vista again. I am hoping to hit platinum soon. My in laws have their 50th anniversary scheduled on the Vista so I hope to make it a wonderful vacation for them. [REVIEW_2] Please u restaurant was our first meal when arriving from Florida.shelly was so sweet.we will come back many times during our stay.thanks again shelly! [REVIEW_3] These guys get hospitality! I had a chance to chat with the owners while I was there and Scott and Taylor really get it! Great food; great service; great people; all at a great price! I will be back! [REVIEW_4] We had already spend a long while walking around through the parade and wanted to kill time before we got oysters. We were waiting for the line to die down at two other places but came across Creole House on the way to French quarter. The line was short and it was only a 20 minute wait. I am an oyster fiend. Living in NYC I got oysters every other night enjoying 2-3 dozens by myself. Thinking the oysters would be delicious ; I ordered 2 dozens and so did my sister. We also shared a cup of gumbo. My sisters friend had a shrimp po boy with fries. After half a dozen oysters I started to feel nauseous. I didn't want to waste any oysters so I suffered though the first dozen. My sister has a strong stomach and finish 1.5 dozen. I couldn't eat anymore. The gumbo was terrible. It had no flavor; it was so tiny for 7 dollars(we had way better gumbo at another place the day after for way less). We had a taste of the po boy as well. It was just ok. My sisters friend didn't finish it either. The fries came fresh out the freezer I'm sure. Dry and scrawny little things. Should've just gone to French quarter and ate at one of the other places. Probably would've been better since the lines were longer. Would've been worth the wait. What a waste of money. And stomach space. [REVIEW_5] Have become a regular and love it! Favorite flavor flavor are Mango and Thai Snow smoothie.,4
3,"[REVIEW_1] Pretty good food; if you like food poisoning.  Had beef wraps last night. Pretty tasty. A little fatty. Have had diarrhea all day; and others who ate the food with had to skip class because they couldn't leave the bathroom.  When I came in to tell the manager; the staff working the cash register seemed uninterested and said they would relay the message to the manager; and then returned to using their cell phone.   A quick search on the Environmental Health Services website shows reports in the last 3 years include the following MAJOR VIOLATIONS:   11/29/2016 Rodents; insects; birds or animals Hot and cold holding temperatures Hands clean and properly washed; proper glove use Food contact surfaces: clean and sanitized  02/10/2015  Hot and cold holding temperatures Food contact surfaces: clean and sanitized  03/05/2014  Adequate handwashing facilities available and accessible Food contact surfaces: clean and sanitized Hot and cold holding temperatures   I urge anyone to reconsider if they decide to eat at this restaurant. [REVIEW_2] Really attentive staff....finally people who care about getting you into the restaurant and getting you to come back.  The bartender was fantastic and the waiters were very friendly.  Sitting outside is really nice.  They could us a few citronella candles to keep the bugs away a bit but really not bad.  Also the couches outside were a nice touch and I'd like to see some table in between so we can pop in and just hang with friends.  Great switch in ownership and definitely give it a try...the margaritas are amazing as is the homemade salsa! [REVIEW_3] By far the worst hotel experience of my life.  The reservations staff makes promises that the front desk are not able/willing to keep; and you are left without the room you expected.  This morning the fire alarm went off in the hallway - the cleaning staff out in the hall had no idea what was going on; but said that if it was a drill; an announcement would have come over the loudspeaker.  I'm on the 15th floor; elevators disabled.  Called down to the front desk; only to be put on hold.  Several other hotel guests were in the hall trying to figure out what to do.  Once the alarm was off and the elevator was working I went down to the front desk and was told that ""they"" were checking and working on the elevators and alarms; and that this would be happening all day.  There WAS a sign on the 1st floor about this; but absolutely NO NOTIFICATION to any of the guests on the upper floors.  At least not to the half dozen or so people I spoke to.  I told the manager that she had many terrified people up there; and that the hotel should have made an effort to notify their guests - push a note under the room door; leave a phone message; or at least inform the cleaning staff so they could pass the word along.  I told her that I would leave the hotel if I could; but that I had one more day there.  She offered to cancel my stay so I could leave early.  WOW....what a way to handle a disgruntled guest who has a bill of over $2000 at your hotel.  To not keep reservation promises and not care about how it inconveniences your guests is one thing; but to not care about their safety; and leave them terrified...that's a totally different thing.  I will never stay at this hotel or any of the other hotels/resorts run by the Summit Group. [REVIEW_4] Needed a last minute dinner choice last night. Great choice of craft beers. Fast and friendly service. Loved the burger! This is a top-notch venue! [REVIEW_5] The food was tasty service not so good two of us got our plates then the third person then finally the fourth person and then after we asked we got our appetizers felt kind of rushed out of there a lot of money not a nice atmosphere",2
4,"[REVIEW_1] It was a beautiful day and neither my lovely wife nor I had a particular craving; so we popped into this often passed/never visited chainlet. I had eaten a perfectly acceptible brunch at the original location in Baton Rouge and still had very low expectations...they were not met.      The good first: the service was friendfly and efficient.      The bad: poor quality chips; including some tasting of rancid oil; were accompanied with pretty good salsa and truly tasteless queso. Seriously; the jar of queso in the grocey is eons better.      My lenten crawfish quesedillas were okay; but nothing to write home about and they were probably the tastiest thing to hit our table.      My lovely wife had the not at all lovely (to look at...an amalgam of beiges & light browns in amoebic puddles) Rio Grande plate. Bear in mind; Paige is pretty down with standard American-style mexican if it is fresh; but she was pretty underwhelmed.      The crowd was mostly tourists (from out of town or Metairie/Slidell; etc from the looks of it) so perhaps the lovely setting helped them ignore the pallid dreck proffered here; but its walking distance location will in no way seduce into another visit. [REVIEW_2] Extremely rude staff (including management). I had ordered carry out only to return home with the wrong order. My family has dietary restrictions so we could not eat what we had brought home. So I went back to pick up the correct order. When I got there; I told the manager at the front that we had the wrong order. They said they had my order and knew it was wrong. So I asked why they didn't feel the need to notify my or anything that we had the wrong order. The manager began to blame the employees. No apology; nothing. Don't let the renovations fool you. There was no sense of professionalism or quality customer service. I will not be returning to this location. [REVIEW_3] This store was such a huge disappointment. We are new to Arizona; and I was excited to visit due to the great reviews. I went in search of kitschy SW décor; and I couldn't stay long. The entire store reeked of urine. It was more than my poor nose could handle. [REVIEW_4] Tried the revamped menu. The duck is very good. Pub and Kitchen is always a solid choice. [REVIEW_5] This is another one of those anytime coffee shops. You can come get some work done; people watch; or just grab a drink to go. Either way; its open early and late.  For the quarter; its ""off the beaten path"" but in the busy area the locals hang out; and on the way to Fenchmen where everyone goes for good local music; Jazz; et al.   They have food; not the cheapest; or local; but its better for you than the greasy; salty; fatty foods. Just make sure your service number is visible I got distracted hid my number; and had to stop the guy looking.    Service varies. Since its a busy sidewalk; people stop in for that pick me up before work or party. One minute there is a like 12 long; and the barista is running ragged; the next its dead.   Sometimes I'll sit for over an hour working or catching up on email. I'll order something every so often; and its no big deal for me to queue myself if they get busy. After all it helps those stopping in for a quick drink.  p.s. I love there tall cookies  oh and how many coffee shops can you get a shot in your coffee! That's right; its not a bar; but its New Orleans.",2
5,[REVIEW_1] I moved to STL from Nashville; TN; where I had one hell of a hairdresser. It took me a while to find a hairdresser as well as the one I had in TN; but I found it at V Vegaz. I go to Jason. I have curly hair; but often wear it straight. If you have curly hair; and you are serious about a good cut; then you know how hard it is to find a hairdresser that knows curly hair. If so; Jason is your man. Great salon!! And if you work on The Loop; you get a 15% discount. Can't beat that! [REVIEW_2] Rude and impatient while going through the drive thru. It was an inconvenience to ask Monica any kind of question. Won't be back. If you don't like your job work somewhere else. [REVIEW_3] Food was delish and tasty; but more importantly - service was superb! We asked if the restaurant served wine; and they told us it was BYOB. So a few minutes after sitting down; hubby and I got dressed to go out and get smthg in nearby bar - that's when owner told us he found a bottle of wine and gave it to us on the house! That was so nice; genuine and thoughtful! Excellent; cozy; yummy place for lunch; with warm hospitality -highly recommend! [REVIEW_4] I think I am giving it five stars because this place was a real surprise. I have never been to a place like this- just altogether special in decor; service; food and drink... You will not regret swinging by here.  One; the place is adorable. Upon first glance; one might note that it is reminiscent of an old industrial factory; but more like a factory that a group of rag-tag children made into a playhouse. Vibrant color; flowers; natural lights fun stair cases; decorative window panes... Really fun environment.   Service was a little slow; but considering they were packed to the brim because of our conference I let it slide. Waitress and hostess were really friendly.   This place has delicious and fresh burgers that come in such unique flavor combinations. I came back a second time just to try another one. First one I had was the Hog-Thai'ed which was a peanut glazed burger served with Thai rice noodles. SOOOOOO GOOOD. The one I had the next day was the American. (If you're worried about your cardiovascular health; please don't eat this one.) it is your classic bacon burger topped with melted cheese and fried Mac-n-cheese. Let's just say it changed me. Fries are amazing and paired perfectly with their unique sauces. Loved the sriracha mayo. A must try.   They also serve a million types of sodas including draft sodas; shakes (loved the cinnamon shake) as well as boozy shakes which are as wonderful wd they sound.   If you're looking for THE place in downtown St. Louis; please stop here. [REVIEW_5] I reserved a full sized car. When I arrived at my scheduled time; they had none. The salesman sold me on accepting a Kia Soul; he told me it was the equivalent of full sized vehicle. When I got home; knowing nothing about this vehicle; I did some research. It is classified as a sub compact. So Enterprise took my full payment for a full sized vehicle and completely screwed me. I don't have time to go back to the rental office; so I am stuck paying full price for a sub compact; and I have to use this vehicle for a 1400 mile trip. Never again will I use this rental agency. Don't be like me; do better research and be prepared when they try to screw you over!,3
6,[REVIEW_1] FINALLY!! st. louis has a place at which i look forward to eating when i am visiting!!  i have been here twice and there is just no competition. the food is delicious; fresh; (dare i say?) even a little challenging! which we love. people reviewing here who didn't love the food are not adventurous. so; if you're not that type; try some place on the hill where you can drown your blown-out tastebuds in marinara or a nice mediocre alfredo sauce. the cocktails are perfect. everything we ate was perfect. and we left feeling sated but not overfed; as is often the case at places in the midwest. the last time we ate at here was the day after xmas; and we're STILL reminiscing. :) i love that they only accommodate groups of four or less. this really adds to the general charm of the place and speaks to the quality of the food. clearly; they're taking their time and making every dish perfect back in the kitchen; which you just cannot do when a table of eight tromps through. the dishes on the menu are made for sharing; and are the perfect size for 3 or 4 people; so it makes sense in this way too. it also means that the noise level is low.  it's such a refreshing break from all the other utterly characterless food in st. louis. [REVIEW_2] The burgers were good.  I loved the quiet atmosphere; we went on a Monday at 5.  My boyfriend had a shot of whiskey that he enjoyed.  Overall it was great. [REVIEW_3] Never mind the fact that I was the only female in the joint all night long; this is a fine establishment that makes me ooze with positive verbiage. Excellent food; service; and even better prices. Best on 2nd Street by a long shot. [REVIEW_4] Great place!!! Always surprise me whenever I visit. I little bit pricey but definitely worth occasionally visiting. Best house made pastry series I ever had in Indy. I feel Coffee actually became second priority here compared to the food. Warning! It can be Qqqquite busy sometimes. [REVIEW_5] What's not to love? this place is actually Laotion; or food from Laos. which is why you may find dishes slightly different then Vietnamese. So first off the food is amazing and they are open late everyday! until midnight on weekends and 10pm week days. There is a Shaved Milk Ice bar which is very good treat while you wait for food or after you eat!; it's condensed milk on shaved ice with choice of many toppings from fresh fruits to weird jelly cubes. There is also and fresh Ban Mi bar; which is a pork sandwich with arrangement of toppings. the staff is nice and decor is cool.,5
7,[REVIEW_1] I would rarely just drop by a restaurant that I see on an Interstate billboard.  Can't believe I have never been to this BBQ joint. Great atmosphere; enjoyed the Turnover and Corn Casserole.  If the whole wait staff work like Tyler; this place will become my favorite.  The STL sauce is much more like a Memphis vinegar based sauce and reminds me of Corky's.  I'll be back and bring the family! [REVIEW_2] What a great experience! The courses are delicious and it's hard to make a wrong choice here. Also; a surprisingly great cocktail menu (in the top three restaurant menus I've had) and attentive staff. Every minute and every plate was amazing. [REVIEW_3] Food was great. But very disappointed with the hospitality. We  entered the restaurant at 9:15 pm but was denied dine in and was told that though the  restaurant closes at 10 pm they won't let us dine in and can give only to go. They saw that there were two pregnant women and a kid with us and I explained that our home is a hour drive from there and yet they denied for no reason. I had to drive back to home and make everyone eat. Very disappointed with such attitude towards customers. Never going back here. Let them try to forgive them self for denying dining for pregnant women. [REVIEW_4] My family has come here for years! Food is always the same and taste amazing! Super friendly and welcoming! [REVIEW_5] Best Indian restaurant in the area by far. I can't comment on the ambiance because I always just get take out - I highly recommend the food!,4
8,[REVIEW_1] Was our first visit and certainly not our last. We had a party of 14 to celebrate a birthday and the service was excellent; the food was amazing! There was so much that we are going to enjoy it again at home. There were so many choices so I can't wait to return to try other things on the huge menu! It is certainly a busy BYOB; and the parking can get a bit tight. The only critique I have is the parking which was not well lit and I did not see a handicap spot unless it was occupied. Bruno's will certainly be my first choice for excellent Italian food! [REVIEW_2] Wow!!! This place is awesome!!! We ordered a bunch of breakfast stuff and it was all perfect! I would suggest the corned beef hash and ham. I would also suggest asking for Pam because she was super friendly and welcoming!  This place is exactly what I actually want when I go to Perkins or IHOP or Denny's; but can never get at those places.   Highly recommended!!!! [REVIEW_3] I had an awful experience at the KOP Makeup Forever Boutique last Friday night. I went there because my esthetician friend told me that it would be the best makeup for my very sensitive; reactive skin. I have a chronic illness and have to take medicine that causes this. She told me that the boutique in King of Prussia was the best place to go for the most knowledgable help. At first; I had a great experience with a nice guy named Christian; who helped me out as I explained my issues and tried two products on me that I ended up purchasing. Low and behold; I broke out terribly after trying to use them for over a week. I packed both products neatly and nicely in the boxes and bag they came in with the receipt and went back to the  King Of Prussia boutique to return them since I could not use them. I was promptly approached by a gal who without really talking or listening to me just grabbed my bag and rudely pulled my receipt out of my bag and smirked while pointing to the return policy at the bottom of the receipt which stated you cannot return any used product. No exchanges or credits either she smugly told me. I had no idea! Was not informed of this policy at all! Would never have purchased skin products with my sensitivities and reactions knowing that I couldn't return something if it didn't work for me and/or might make things worse. I was shocked and felt like I should have been informed of this policy clearly by Christian. I also could not believe how rude and mean the woman was whom I had to deal with my second time in- it was like she seemed to enjoy telling me that I was screwed and enjoyed the look of disappointment on my face. Now I have $80+ worth of product that I will never use/cannot use and a very bad taste in my mouth about Make Up Forever. I am very disappointed with the company and very shocked that this woman that I had to deal with at KOP is able to keep her job. I am going to keep trying to make contact with somebody at Makeup Forever at a higher level and hope for the best. Until then; I would just warn people to stay away from there all together unless you are sure that you know you love what you are purchasing and hopefully you won't have to deal with the mean lady:(. [REVIEW_4] They call a chicken salad sandwich two cubes of chicken with mayo in it and a salad with a salad that is a bowl Of lettuce a salad? Hmm left here hungry.... [REVIEW_5] This is my first review and I really felt it was needed.  I love to cook but also love eating out . It's very exciting to see all the new restaurants opening up around town and I really want them all to succeed. I've been to Nox  many times now. I have to say it's been so inconsistent last night being the Worst!!!  Waitstaff were inexperienced; appetizers came out with the dinners and only one was hot.  Had to send two out of the three dinners back for various reasons.  As you know Restaurants seem to come and go around here so please guys pay attention and remember you're only as good as your staff.  Sincerely,2
9,[REVIEW_1] I compare this hotel to a pig wearing lipstick.  It is still a pig.  Nice beds; yup; updated bathrooms; yes; new carpet in room; yes. Nice staff; yes. So why 1 star?  It is a dump and whoever decided to put all this new stuff into rooms that smell like mold and mildew should be fired. I am staying here for a convention so someone else booked the rooms as I usually look at reviews before making a reservation. Heading that it was a Marriott and that is was an Opryland hotel; I thought; oh it will be nice. After walking into the room and getting the nasty smell hit me; I turned to the Marriott app to look st the reviews as well as on yelp.  Many other complaints posted. I asked my co-workers and 3 of the 4 people that I am traveling with also have the same smell.   Note to the management team: shame on you for booking these rooms without fixing the problem. [REVIEW_2] I can't say enough about this wonderful store. The staff knows you before you even walk in the door. I walked in and bought a $50 bracelet for my mother. They treated me like I was buying the Crown Jewels. The put it in a box with gold leaf that with ribbon. It's then placed in a bag with gold leaf. You feel appreciated and valued.   I stood next to a woman buying a string of pearls worth more than an average new car. Everyone is treated exactly the same.   I've come back time and time again. I've bought watches there. I've bought their ceramic money jars. Every time has been a great experience.   They have a complimentary cookie and beverage bar for customers. They are always their for a quick repair or battery replacement.   This business is one of a kind. [REVIEW_3] The crappy Indiana roads blew one of my tires on my CTS on I465N. I was able to drive to them and they changd my tire at 11 pm at night in no time!! Thanks Guys!! [REVIEW_4] ONE OF THE BEST AND FRIENDLIEST INDIAN RESTAURANTS IN THIS AREA AND TAMPA. I live nearby and eat a lot of Indian food between California and Florida in my life. Gateway is one of the top 3 indian restaurant I have eaten at. The service is always so friendly and the staff takes time to make small talk with you; which is unusual. I order out or eat in almost every week. [REVIEW_5] Nothing more to say than this is the BEST donut place ever. I literally wished they shipped their products. When I moved to Florida; I missed it so much. It's only in New Orleans... sad face!,4
10,[REVIEW_1] Probably one of my favorite places to go. The Appetizers are amazing! Would recommend getting The Brussels Sprouts; The Fish Tacos & The Pretzels. The beer is amazing always taste so fresh; I've tried every beer they brew and not one of them I didn't like! [REVIEW_2] I care that much for doughnuts but these are pretty amazing. Their bacon maple one is incredible and worth trying. Also their sliders are equally great. I've had their cheeseburger one and chicken caesar and would get them again [REVIEW_3] This is the BEST Hot sausage place ...hands down....GOOOOO GOOOO NOW... ask for the relish (really pepper hash) makes it MAGICALLY Delish....I'm having wife delivery me a hot sausage as I'm writing this...can't WAIT [REVIEW_4] This is the place we have been searching for! My friend and I have tried several nail salons in Tampa and nobody could do designs and stuff like how we wanted so we found this place on Instagram and we will never go anywhere else again! We drive almost an hour to get here but it is so worth it! I have had 2 different people who both did exactly what I wanted and are extremely talented! Thank you Pamela and Steven! You all do amazing work!!! [REVIEW_5] The service here is just incredible. I was always a little shy asking what whiskies to try.....its a whiskey bar filled with whiskey fans. I didnt be made fun of!  But nope. The bartender; Scott I believe his name was; told me about the flights. He said if I was a newbie; the flights wouldnt be that great for me and made me a custom flight. And it was perfect. I now know exactly what to get and what style I like. Scott was also there any time my glass was empty....even when the bar got packed; he was on top of ever drink order with the quickness.   Oh; and get food. Anything you get here is awesome.,5
11,"[REVIEW_1] Paid $18 for a poor gel manicure job. There was already a smudge when she finished and didn't even bother to correct it. Also the polish did not get enough coats applied so my nails have a soft texture to them. I will be going somewhere else and having this manicure removed. [REVIEW_2] My husband and I went here right before they were closing because we were in the neighborhood and needed some items for a recipe we were planning to make the next day.  I was super disappointed in this food outlet.  The meat section looked AWFUL; most of the meat was turning brown and the whole back of the store smelled like rotten food.  Like I said; it was around closing time; but it totally turned me off and gave me a ""gut feeling"" that I shouldn't buy anything from this store.  The layout was also a bit unorganized.  I will not be back. [REVIEW_3] I wish I could go back and time and not eat here. We waited 50 minutes for cold chips and salsa; they were stale and they didn't even have picode Gallo. They charge for them! The burrito was cold; and when I asked they said they plate was suppose to be cold. Really? Cold rice and beans too?  The margarita was the only good thing and the 80's music. [REVIEW_4] El Tumi is a small restaurant in a small restaurant complex and it's no wonder if someone desperately looking for good food on a cold winter evening totally overlooks this place. I'm just glad we didn't make that mistake. El Tumi had great good and nice staff. The menu was so unique that it left me wondering why there are not many Peruvian restaurants in the bay area. Run of the mill cuisines - Italian; mexican and mediterranean - exude the image of mass-production and lack of creativity can make the meal quite forgettable. Peruvian dishes are something else - delightfully different. Perhaps it's the rareness of Peruvian restaurants that makes the cuisine so exclusive. I especially loved the yucca fries and the Peruvian style vegetarian fried rice. Besada - the hot peruvian barley beverage was very soothing on the cold winter night. Loved the passion fruit drink too. El Tumi is definitely worth visiting second night in a row when in Tahoe. I will make sure to look out for Peruvian restaurants whenever I go traveling/visiting a new place. [REVIEW_5] I used Sultans last year and this year for moving and both times they were wonderful to work with! The first time I used them; they realized that my couch didn't fit through my door (after trying extensively) and they would not be able to hoist my couch up to my second floor unit due to an awning. They stored my couch for free and then came back a week later with a creative and innovative way to successfully get my couch through the window! They came back to move me out of the same unit this year; Tom remembered me and was super helpful in facilitating the move out. They were so friendly the whole time and truly made both of my moves easy! All of the movers both times were super friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend them for anything.",2
12,"[REVIEW_1] Its your tnormal Mexican food restaurant joint. Very quick..they get you in and out. [REVIEW_2] Probably the best meal I have ever had.  We were overwhelmed with the quality of the food.  I had a smoked fish appetizer; spinach gnocchi and pasta with artichokes; a Mediterranean white fish fillet that just melted in the mouth.  Dessert I ordered was a strawberry rhubarb cobbler.  Now; we had WAY more food than what we ordered; as the chef sends out little surprises during the dinner courses.  Three hours after arriving; we left totally sated and feeling like we had just experienced something really special.  Of course; for the price; one would expect something special; but this was far beyond special--this was a meal to remember. [REVIEW_3] Terrible Service! I went there with a co worker around 5pm to get drinks using a giftcard I got from RiteAid.com. I've been there a couple times because their chicken fingers are delicious! When I got there; I told the bartender that I had 2 /$10 coupons(only because it didnt allow me to buy $20); she said I could only use one coupon per month. So I said 'okay well then we'll just be getting some drinks.'  She never said anyrhing else. So when we get the bill; the owner came over and told me to never come back!! All because we didnt order food and he thought I was scamming him!! (If she said we had to buy food then we would have) Then said shouted that doesn't support alcoholism! (But owns a bar) I can't believe because I had 3 beers after work on a Monday; I'm considered an alcoholic! The bill was about $18 and I was going to give a good tip but.... I'm never going back. Just like another review I saw for this place- ""These people judge a book by its cover."" If you don't want people to use the coupons!! don't offer to be on the website!!. It's simple. Such bad business! [REVIEW_4] Every time I go there the service is terrible nd today they didn't have anything except pulled port. Terrible service and terrible management [REVIEW_5] Just meh ramen; having people wait outside in line; in the sun; is in fact a stupid idea (even though management was so petty they put a sign on the door stating it's not a dumb idea). The wait staff sucked; couldn't get a refill on drinks the entire time we were there; and the server told me not to use Sriracha or I would ruin my meal; kid please; I know what I like; if I want Sriracha give me the dang sauce. Overall just a crappy restaurant; only reason it will stay in business is the hipsters.",2
13,[REVIEW_1] It is amazing that a restaurant can maintain its high standards and reasonable prices over so many years.  I started eating at Caruso's many years ago when I attended UA.  Upon my return to Tucson I was surprised to see that it was still open and still great!  They have a wonderful hearty red sauce which enhances every dish on which it is used.  The manicotti and parmesan dishes are outstanding.  Their house Italian dressing is my favorite anywhere.  They do have a special lunch menu.  They do not take reservations for smaller parties; so it is good to come early for weekend dinner to avoid a wait for a table. [REVIEW_2] BeAutiful; clean spa. Rachel was my masseuse -- highly recommend! Her attention to detail was in point and unlike any other massage I've ever had. [REVIEW_3] I love Jay's!!   It's affordable; they deliver; and it's really good; creative sushi!  Plus; the eggplant lady thing is amazing! Yes; it's true; they are not fluent in english but they know enough to take your order; and they are super friendly. I even like this place better than some of the big name sushi places!  I highly recommend!! [REVIEW_4] One of my favorites to take out of town guests to; or for any special occasion. Intimate setting that it great for conversation and the food is exceptional. Friendly; family-oriented restaurant that you can tell has stood the test of time for a reason. This place is an experience! Be sure to wear stretchy pants because you will be FULL when you leave. :) [REVIEW_5] It is a true Italian market. They have a wide selection of fresh groceries: meats; pasta (yes; fresh pasta); breads; and cheeses. They also have a very large selection of frozen pasta and pre made pasta dishes to take home for a quick dinner. They have a sandwich counter that also has fresh made dishes (lasagna; chicken/eggplant parmigiana; ravioli; manicotti; etc). There's a coffee/espresso bar; bakery; wine cellar and cheese room as well. I haven't had anything there that I haven't LOVED! I like to take advantage of the panini of the day when I can make it in. The time if recommend to go is during the fall. They have pumpkin ravioli and gnocchi; pumpkin cheesecake drink; and a thanksgiving inspired panini.,5
14,[REVIEW_1] Food is good.  Decor is nice.   Service was terrible.  Our drink orders were not what we ordered.  Rather than tell us they don't carry certain items;  they made up their own drinks.  It was terribly disappointing. [REVIEW_2] Was in town for a meeting; and have always wanted to try Luke's; and only a 3 min walk from the Marriott Courtyard. I had Oysters; Salad; and Chicken for my main dish. Absolutely the best I've ever had! Great service; friendly staff; didn't have a reservation; but only took 5mins to seat me in a packed house; on a Thursday night. [REVIEW_3] Incredible service and incredible food! The black bean ravioli is succulent! The bone-in steak was flavorful and amazingly juicy and delicious. And the best of all; service was perfect. From the friendly hostess to the waiter to the chef who personally came over to make sure we enjoyed our food; everyone really made us feel at home.   As an added bonus; the ambiance is beautiful. Decor; lighting; and fireplace makes the place very homely.   Highly recommended. I went as a group of four and had an excellent time. [REVIEW_4] As soon as you walk in to the dental spa; you are greeted by a wonderful staff of professionals. A first class dental office with a expert dentist; Dr Harold Yaffe      It is very easy to see that with the professionalism of Dr Yaffe; and a great staff ; you are at one of the top dental practices in the USA..... It always starts with the top and that is Dr Yaffe and his great staff follows  his lead .... Ron S [REVIEW_5] Absolutely no complaints. Micah and Shaun completed my move (up and down 3 flights of rickety stairs!) efficiently and took great care with my things. They were friendly and courteous the entire move. My interactions with the office staff during the booking and estimate was great too. I would definitely use CH again!,4
15,"[REVIEW_1] House of Beauty is an absolute sham; and possibly a scam!  I ordered products from them some years ago; and waited a ridiculously long time to receive them.  I decided to try them again recently; ordered my products online more than 6 weeks ago; and have received NOTHING!  No one ever answers their phone; and I have written several emails with no response whatsoever.  DO NOT order anything from these people; they are terrible!  Angela [REVIEW_2] I will literally never eat here because the owner/parking lot bouncer was very rude when we went to dinner on Saint Patrick's day ar Tir a Nog.. We tried to park in open parking that was sectioned off by SHORT HILLS RESTAURANT AND DELI OF CHERRY HILL NJ;  orange cones and signs (which by the way are completely illegal) and they were not respectful nice or friendly about us accidentally parking there.. They were simply jealous of the prosperous Irish pub... The man/parking lot bouncer (not sure of his name) was completely rude... Even though they closed at 9 he would not let us park there as of 8:15... We are new residents to this area and looking for new local places to enjoy BUT we will NOT EVER be enjoying this place (SHORT HILLS RESTAURANT AND DELI) since the owner(or parking lot bouncer was so rude) we will NEVER fraternize a business who stands for being rude to their neighbors and especially to their fellow business owners who pay for the parking spots just as much as they do.... Short Hills Restaurant and Deli  I'm extremely disappointed in you're neighborhood hospitality and how you treat you're neighbors!! [REVIEW_3] I've been 3 times; so I think I can share a fair judgement.  This business is a lot of show; without the go.   Service has been the overall department that has been completely lacking along with some breakfast items are products of horrible cooking.  First time: asked for black coffee and a matcha latte; dad didn't get his coffee until our food already arrived (which also seemed to take forever) and I actually never received my matcha latte after asking and reminding waiters more than eight times; 8!!! It got to be comical; which is why we counted.  By the end of our breakfast they finally offered it to me in it as a to go drink and still had the audacity to charge me for it; so I said no.  Second visit; was dinner with friends; this was a much more pleasant experience; there was four of us; we shared a bottle of wine and I remember I liked my food. No complaints here. Third time; was another breakfast round... I'm not sure what it is about breakfast but I don't think they do a good job for breakfast. To start with; we were given menus for both breakfast and lunch; which was appreciated; but no drink menus and we were specifically interested in mimosas or Bloody Mary's etc. because we didn't know what to order; or what was our options were... my dad ordered a Bloody Mary; and I ordered a Mimosa. I only mention this because it was frustrating to see other people have different variations of mimosas and also bloody mary's; other breakfast cocktails which we didn't even know existed.  My dad ordered a ham and cheese omelette with his side of home fries. I ordered the power bowl muesli.  We got through two drinks before the food came; which actually was a long time. By the time our food came; the order was wrong - my dad had fruit; but no home fries as he requested.  We immediately let our server know; and she said she would go grab them.  Additionally; our plates were extremely bland.  Just an omelette; no garnish or sides at all (other than the fruit in the side bowl.  The plates just looked sad.  Also; I could tell by looking at the omelette it wasn't good; that's how bad it was; and my dad concurred.  The wait staff failed to bring his home fries in any kind of fast or quick manner; so we reminded our bartender; who then reminded to server; once my dad got a refill on his coffee we also then reminded that server as well.  We ate through the entire meal; never got the home fries; and in the end right as our check was being delivered we mentioned the homefries again; and that's when the bartender sent a server running for them; and as we were signing our check is when they came out and were offered as a ""to go"" option.  While a simple side; it was really disappointing to go the entire breakfast with an awkward feeling of  ""I guess they just don't care"" and instead of comping anything; the manager offered me a $15 off coupon the next time we came in.  It's just hard to ever want to come in again... and didn't feel like an adequate apology on a $45 breakfast.  And lastly my dads omelette tasted like McDonalds.  Only upside was that my muesli power bowl was delicious; just hard to believe it took as long as it did to come out or that anything cost as much as it did with as horrible of service and lack of ""care"" put behind anything that was done there. [REVIEW_4] My family has come here for years! Food is always the same and taste amazing! Super friendly and welcoming! [REVIEW_5] Ordered food came super fast! But when we ordered dessert that's when it took 20 mins.  When the dessert came to the table my gf asks me is this supposed to have tomatoes I say no. She is about to eat her second bite and I tell her to stop. I find a piece of paper inside the bread pudding.  I ask for the manager and he comes over I inform him of these extra items. He offers me another bread pudding.... I decline. The waitress offered to refund my money for the dessert...",1
16,"[REVIEW_1] Best casino in Reno.   4 deck and 2 deck blackjack; real drink glasses (no plastic fratboy cups); amazing decorum that will burn your retinas; and the restaurants inside are better the big casinos on the strip by a factor of a thousand. The rooms are stellar for the price.  Get a hot tub and chilllllll. [REVIEW_2] Only giving a 1 because there is nothing lower!!! Angie Gave me the worst haircut I've ever had!!! I came in with 2 photos of the cut I wanted came out with my hair looking NOTHING like the photos!!  Even when pointed out to her she didn't not pay attention to what she was doing.  Came out basically having a mans flattop!  Would never go to this place again!!! Nothing like going into the Holidays with a crappie haircut. Thank you!! Angie and Regis Hair salon!! [REVIEW_3] Stay away from this dealership.  I have wrote about 3 different reviews on their site and I keep giving them one more chance but wont anymore.  My whole family drives Hyundai but constantly they find ways to screw you over. [REVIEW_4] Ordered curried chicken; teriyaki; and some eggrolls with soup...I never got that order  This was my first and last time ordering food from here. Delivery was quick; I'll give them that; but the order was wrong. When I called in they said I can have a free meal on them for the mistake.  I said; okay ""I want that free meal now"" (they also offer free delivery for orders over 12.00$) my food came out to 14.87$; 18.87$ with tip.   They refused multiple times (like it'll make a difference if they bring it now or tomorrow; either way it was a lie to get me off the phone). I informed her that if she didn't send her delivery guy back I'll dispute the amount paid to them with my bank; and they'll lose a new customer.   Normally if one thing in my order was wrong I wouldn't mind at all. It's because my entire order was Wong... [REVIEW_5] Was looking for some good Thai food and took a chance.  The reviews on yelp were good and I think the food was great!  Had the rolls as an appetizer and they were so yummy!  Very friendly owners and staff.  Also had the Pad Thai Chicken and could not eat it all.  Very generous portions; just wish I had a way to take the left overs with me but no microwave at the hotel!  Splurged and also enjoyed an iced Thai tea and the coconut custard.",2
17,"[REVIEW_1] I had a reservation for 8 pm and arrived 5 minutes earlier. We were checked in and was told it wont be long. We sat waiting for 20 minutes and not even someone to acknowledge us to tell us how much longer. [REVIEW_2] Been coming here with my brother for 10 years and will continue to come here for many more I hope. Get a players card; it's free; and they don't care how much money you play with just how long you play. If you have a card you will get amazing comps like free rooms and dining discounts. After their 500 million dollar expansion they really are the best hotel in Reno and it's a nice distance from downtown where now it's become ghetto. Great staff; service; food; drinks; and entertainment. 5 stars all the way! [REVIEW_3] Peter saved us the serious tragedy of missing another day of work and the misfortune of being taken by the dealership. We can't thank him enough for getting us in right away and getting us back on road. [REVIEW_4] The lady who works here is a miracle worker! I came in with a couple pairs of pants that needed to be hemmed; and a suit jacket whose sleeves needed to be shortened (both of which are not quick and easy; since suits are normally lined and it's a lot of work). I also needed it to be done fast - I was leaving the country the next day. Not only did she do all of these alterations in a day; they were also excellently done - neat and professional - and now I have a beautiful suit that fits me brilliantly for my business trip! Plus; they take all credit cards - including Amex! - and have very reasonable hours.   Definitely returning. [REVIEW_5] Worst movie theater around!  I am within walking distance and avoid this theater.  I'd rather drive out of town then waste my money going here.   Today I decided to give them another try only because there was a free screening being offered.  Gofobo apparently rents space to do screenings at Loews.  I understand it is a separate company.  I understand that they are not affiliated but when you rent space to a company that poorly runs events at your facility it is a reflection on your business as well.  That aside; a little courtesy and  goes a long way.  I do not understand why people with no customer service skills decide to work in a service industry.  How they become managers is also a mystery.   Gofobo offered a free screening at Loews today.  The representative stated that over 500 tickets were issued for the screening.  As a matter of fact; while I was at the theater I was able to see that tickets were still being offered online.  However; after a 1 hour wait (longer for many others) we were told that the theater was full. I do not remember the exact number but the theater held less than 200!  Less than 200 yet over 500 tickets were given out!    Here is where I have an issue with Loews.  I asked to see the theater manager.  I was upset that I had wasted my day.  I had gotten a baby sitter for my infant son and planned to have a day with my daughter.  We went out in the rain expecting to see a movie and after waiting in a line for an hour while peoples purses were searched and a few people were let in at a time we were then told the theater was full.  We were told to leave our email address and we would be issued tickets for a future screening.  I waited for a manager.  What a waste.  The manager; ""Nicole"" was very rude.  All she needed to say was; ""I am very sorry.  I understand"".  Instead she stared at me and only said; ""OK"" in response to everything I said to her.  No Nicole; it is not OK.  It is not okay that my time was wasted.  If you couldn't offer to let us into a different movie how about at least offering some empathy and simply saying I am sorry for the confusion then pass the blame onto Gofobo.  I feel sorry for your staff.  I hope you do not treat them as poorly as you treat customers!  Time to brush up on your customer service skills!  You really do not belong working in management in the service industry.    My past experiences with Loews have been poor.  We were there a few months ago and it was gross.  The floors and cup holders were sticky.  Food spilled everywhere.  The bathrooms were also gross.  This was the second bad experience in a row.  I had said then that I would not be back.  The only reason I gave them another try was because it was a free screening.  In the future; free wont even get me to go back there.  They have permanently lost this family as customers.",3
18,"[REVIEW_1] Outstanding customer service! And my car is driving great now! Brian and the other guys walked me through the work I needed on my car; and I never once felt taken advantage of or blindsided. I ended up needing four new tires and a new hub cap; talk about bad news! But they were extremely professional; personable; and treated me like a human being. I've experienced auto shops that treat me like an idiot; that do a poor job fixing my car; or that tell me I need extra work done (for a fee; of course). It turns out I did need ""extra"" work; but Brian showed me the damage; explained the process; and showed a lot of compassion. And now my car is remarkably better. I will definitely be back in the future; and I would recommend Tires Plus in Flourtown to anyone. [REVIEW_2] Aw; man. I was hoping I'd previously posted a glowing review of RuSan's so I could prove that once upon a time; I liked it here. But; I didn't so just trust me on this one.  It is with a heavy heart that I relay today's experience over the lunch sushi buffet. Cold; gelatinous; and ~$11/each. It's been a year or three but I remember this being so much better. Don't get me wrong... I love cheap; fast food-ish; ethnic cuisine and I have lovely memories of the Ginger Simmered Beef; Fried Garlic and Bay Shrimp Salad Maki (like I said; once upon a time); but today? Lackluster is an overstatement.  With each bite; I kept hoping the next would be better. But; alas. It wasn't.   Why; RuSan's? With all your new neighboring restauranteurs in The Gulch; is this the taste of complacency? I shake my head in disappointment because I know your potential and cherish what we once had.   On the upside; my water was refreshing and the service was fine. [REVIEW_3] I've had some great Ethiopian food but this place was the worst ever; very disappointing and overpriced!  The service was very slow and the waitress spent most of the time chatting with her fellow employees and essentially ignoring us.    The menu was misleading - it lists a combo of ""all vegetables"" for $15; but really you just get 8 items of their choosing - the ""Queen's Eight"" platter.  Our waitress didn't even know this; until I questioned after she only brought us 6 items; and she had to ask someone else.  It seems unfair to charge the exact same price for a vegetarian platter as for one with meat dishes.    Every other place I've visited served the combo platter on a big piece of injera spread out on a large plate but here they serve a few (very small) portions of items on a couple of strips of injera.  Their injera was a disgrace!  As some other reviewers have noted; it was slightly dried out and the edges were crusty!  To top it off; the veggie items were maybe lukewarm; at best; and pretty bland for Ethiopian cuisine.    As we finished up our meal; I chose to eat a salvageable portion of the injera that had all the juices soaked into it.  Unfortunately hiding underneath it was a long black hair!  Needless to say; we won't be back!!! [REVIEW_4] Best place late night.. authentic simple food.   Great service and friendly staff. Food was awesome - had the breakfast wrap. [REVIEW_5] I ordered the chicken stew; it was Tasteless chicken; it was a fried chicken possibly a leftover; that was thrown into a pot and made it into a stew.  If I wanted leftovers; I would have eaten at home.  Gross; still feel like I have to throw up.",2
19,[REVIEW_1] Customer service at its finest; combined with great food and a diverse menu.  Always a good experience since I've been going there the last 2 years.  Misha genuinely cares about her customers and takes the time to get to know them (by name).  The wake-up breakfast wrap is the best! [REVIEW_2] Rosemary's Grill is my favorite resaurant.  My wife and I take my Mother in law to Rosemary's Grill often for many reasons.  Their menu is extensive.  You can get Classic American food in many categories prepared fresh and delicious with great care and attention to detail that is lacking in common chain restaurants.  You can also get traditional Turkish cuisine that is the very best kebab that I ever had.  Rosemary's is a family owned business and they treat you like you are part of that family.  We are making Rosemary's our Saturday night place.  last weekend my wife and I took my. Mother in law to Rosemary's Grill for dinner.  It was even better that the time before.  I tried the Mixed grill kebab platter.  Lamb; Chicken; Adana; and gyro kebab meats; so tender and expertly spiced and grilled; along with a shepherds salad; grilled half tomatoes; rice; and of course flat bread.  The Adana kebab was particularly tender; juicy; and tasty.  I had never had Adana kebab before and will be ordering it again.  I shared a taste with my Mother in law and she loved it too!  mom in law had crab cakes and she enjoyed them very much.  My wife had the French onion soup; which she raves about and always orders.  She also had the roast turkey; mashed potatoes; cranberry sauce; and corn.  She loved everything on that platter.  She commented that the gravy was especially good.  The portion sizes are huge and we love to have the left overs again at home.  I have honestly not been to a restaurant in the area that has such good quality in all there entrees; sides; salad bar; and drinks; and you have to try the rice pudding.  We have eaten a few times here for breakfast; lunch; and dinner and it continues to be our very favorite place.  The waitstaff and owners make you feel right at home and are warm; welcoming; and friendly.  I can not say enough good things.    Sent from my iPad [REVIEW_3] Great service; large portion size and reasonable prices. My new favorite place to go for dinner. We will definitely return. [REVIEW_4] I've used Merrigans several times for work on both a 2012 RV and a vintage 1984 Dolphin. They aren't the best at always answering the phones or calling back but they are the best at fixing what's wrong at a fair price. Your patience will be rewarded with a quality repair at a fair price. It's an honest mom and pop shop that has an eclectic collection of parts for older RV's along with the know-how and experience to fix anything. Definitely the place in Tucson where you won't get ripped off for work on your RV. If you want it done right and still have money left in your travel fund; go to Merrigans. They also have a FREE 24 hr. dump station WITH water.

20,"[REVIEW_1] first off the service is absolutely terrible. the waiter only came over to take our order and bring us our drinks and food. after that when we needed something we practically had to look around to hunt him down during our entire meal. he never bothered to come over to check on us to see if we needed drink refills or how our food was. even when we wanted our check he was no where to be found.  as for the food; my sister had ordered the clam chowder and she had to send it back and asked them to reheat it because it wasn't even warm; it was room tempature. than between the 5 of us we had ordered other dishes and 20 wings (4/person) well there was definitely 20 piece of chicken on the plate; if you count the one tiny piece that looks like the very tip of the chicken wing that usually gets thrown out.  when we brought it up to the waiters attention; after having to look for him for 15 mins; his response was the chefs usually cooks a big batch at a time so they probably miscounted so he'll bring us another wing. we waited another 15 minutes before finally getting his attention to ask for our check and a couple boxes. so by now we have leftovers all packed up and money in the check sleeve ready for the waiter to take. i wanted to leave a feedback with the manager on duty there about our meal so I asked a waitress to get the manager for me since our waiter wasn't around. now we are pretty much ready to leave and the one piece of wing never came out; that is until our waiter overheard us asking for the manager. because as soon as the manager got to our table so did the one piece of chicken wing soaked in oil.  when we told the manager about the wings he pretty much brushed it off and laughed in our face and said ""I guarantee the chefs didn't count this as a wing"" and that ""they probably just shorted you guys a wing and so someone else here got that extra wing"". it was 20 wings for $20 so his solution was telling us he'll take a dollar off our bill if we wanted.  i felt like that was a slap to my face and I felt a little discriminated; like if I wasn't asian things would've been different. I wasn't looking for any type of discount or freebie; all i wanted to do was give a feedback to the manager so he knows they should be more careful since this wasn't the first time they ""miscounted"" (in the past I've been shorted on wings and shrimps) tonight is the last time I'm ever eating/drinking here and i will no longer be recommending people to come here. [REVIEW_2] Has to be the best khmer restaurant in philadelphia.  Great food! great service and fair price.  Pa-Hok with veggie is freaking awesome.  Fried frog legs! My new home away from home. [REVIEW_3] This was the WORST HOTEL STAY EVER!!  asked for a Non- smoking room.  Went to that room and it smelled so bad!  Asked for another room and that room smelled as well.  Not that clean; bathroom was old.  Not a place you wanna stay at.  And they charge a fortune for crap!!  I don't even want to rate this hotel.  But in order to post I have to pick.   One! [REVIEW_4] What can I really say? Classic New Orleans feel. Great service. Great location. The building only has about 6 rooms and the rooms are extremely nice. It's nestled into the neighborhood on esplanade and is a prime location for French quarter exploration. I do recommend the extra parking provided by the hotel as finding parking on the street is next to impossible. Last trip to New Orleans l; we stayed st the Hilton. This place has them best hands down and we will defined be back for future New Orleans trips. [REVIEW_5] It was great.  I had crab Benedict. Just the kind of place i was looking for. Paud parking on the street was easy to find.",3
21,"[REVIEW_1] Awesome prices!  Great selection of shoes not usually found in other stores.  Sign up for the email as well to receive more discounts. Clearance section is practically a steal.  Go check it out! [REVIEW_2] We tried to go here on a Sunday night before a concert.  Got there at 6:30 were on the no wait app.  Said it would be 40 minutes max. We left at 7:40 had not been seated and was told the kitchen was behind.  The last time I was here it took a long time to get our food.  I do not recommend this establishment. [REVIEW_3] I wish I would have read the reviews before stopping here... I drove in looking to quickly get my tires filled with air because my light was on and I was having a difficult time getting them filled up due to my air valve extensions. I told them this and that I was in a hurry because I had an appointment to get to. I told them I only wanted them to fill up my tires and I didn't need them to do their regular inspection because my car is only 3 years old and had been check just a few months ago before moving here. After waiting nearly an hour I asked the man at the counter how much longer it would be and they took me in to the shop... at this point they told me the sensors in my tires either ""all broke at once or didn't have them in the first place."" The mechanic called two places and told me it would cost $800 to get these installed. I told him I wasn't going to pay that because it's not a necessary expense and I wouldn't be able to afford it. At this point I asked if they had even tried filling up my tires with air; to which he told me no. A different mechanic then filled them up with air and told me that the light probably wouldn't go off because of the ""problem with the sensors."" A mile down the road with full tires the light went off! This was not quick or convenient and I do not appreciate men assuming that I do not know anything about cars in an attempt to get me to spend more money to repair problems that don't even exist! [REVIEW_4] The service was very good here. I came during happy hour and my drinks were very strong. I ordered a matzo ball soup-  very good and with flavorful broth. I also had the  beet salad because I'd already had enough fried food at lunch. It was light and refreshing and I loved the spicy pecan candied garnish. Very good. I finished my meal with the bread pudding which I didn't care for personally; I felt like the ice cream texture was flat; and I don't think I like bread pudding. But I'm assuming it's good if you like it because everyone gives it good reviews. The flavor was there. I enjoyed my dinner and my happy hour buzz. [REVIEW_5] Service was ok. Good deals. But the staff was very loud and unprofessional. They were the loudest in the restaurant. Eating while working. Just being generally obnoxious. Will not be going back.",2
22,[REVIEW_1] I just left the spa and booked the signature package which includes and hour message and an hour facial. It was amazing. The staff was so nice and made me feel totally comfortable. My facial was performed by Andie and she was so nice and really knew her stuff. My face feels great! The prices are totally adorable and I will definitely be back. [REVIEW_2] This place is over priced; it was totally empty on a Friday night at 9:30.... Disappointed that I didn't look at the menu before coming here and just looked at the rating. The quality of the food is completely off. They didn't give us utensils to begin with. I am disappointed. [REVIEW_3] The worst meal I ever had. Server was rude; took 25 minutes to receive our meals; order was wrong; food wad cold; hardly any food on the plate. Like the name ROTTEN food.  Less than 1 star. [REVIEW_4] Had a very memorable birthday in SB and was so happy to have Wine Edventures be my gift! Sean picked us up Saturday morning and was super friendly (funny; too). It was just my husband and I along with a group of 10 - who happened to be all guys; having a bachelor party! Haha; so that was pretty funny. We stopped at 3 wineries and 1 brewery. Sean explained where we were as we were driving around and also gave us lessons at the tastings. He provided us with bottled water and souvenir wine glasses. We had lunch at the 2nd vineyard of the day; which was very good - choice of sandwich and a pasta salad side with chips and a cookie (the cookies are awesome). It was a fun day and I'd highly recommend this adventure to anyone looking for a fun day in the SB area. [REVIEW_5] It just wasn't fun; or informative; or interesting; and the water portion-which is the thing that makes it different from other tours-is like 7min. and super boring. The guide wasn't great either; but for us at least they gave out the quakers at the end of the tour; being on the boat for 90 seconds with those things made the tour seem hours longer. There must be a better way to spend your money. I've been on duck tours in other cities and this one is the worst.,2
23,[REVIEW_1] Our favorite little taco place! We always get the steak; chicken; and fish tacos. We looove the queso! Highly recommend. [REVIEW_2] He had the she crab soup and I had lobster bisque. Both were amazing! Rest atmosphere. Bree is terrific waitress! [REVIEW_3] A die hard Met fan; I came here with my sister on Mothers day to watch the Mets play your beloved Phillies.  Citizen's Bank Park is clearly one of the nicest parks in the MLB.  I was impressed with how easy it was to get to as well as the layout.  The park is not too big and it seems that every seat has a great view.  The fans were really respectful and enthusiastic for their home team (Mets won though!).  In addition; there is know doubt that the Philly Phanatic is the best mascot in baseball.  While I love Mr. Met; he can not compare to the fun antics of Phillies mascot.  Food was plentiful and of course pricey; but what isn't in the MLBs.  I will definitely be back.  Congratulations Philadelphia on a great stadium and fun team. [REVIEW_4] So I called and placed an order over the phone with pizza huts apparent call center. the little girl who sounded all of seventeen was very unprofessional no phone experience she messed up my order and put me on hold whole she had a side bar conversation about her friend finally showing up for work.  I say this because when I got there it was a all male crew! My order was wrong the lady had relayed a totally different order. The poor guy at pizza hut making pizza was so frustrated no his fault I totally understood at this point. He apologized and told me he would re make it right now correctly such a respectable man. Something between who takes the call somewhere else and who relays to the establishment has a disconnect. Annoying to have to drive all the way back! [REVIEW_5] Great neighborhood spot.  The food is delicious and everyone is super friendly.  It used to be my go to spot when I lived in the city.  It's a great spot to start or end your night out.,4
24,"[REVIEW_1] Stayed at the Holiday Inn while on vacation; and thought we would give it a try this place is beautiful! Right on water; big and lots to see. Live music was great! I expected great food to come out and what I got was frozen seafood!!! Ordered the calamari- looked great but tasted like frozen fried with no season at all!! Kids got chicken fingers and a burger which also taste frozen and the burger no joke tasted just like a frozen bubba burger you get from the store. Also got the Mango Mai Mai; this I thought for sure would be good but again the fresh was rubbery; over cooked tasted frozen; the baked potato tasted to be old. When it came time to pay; i have my server a $100 bill she brings me back change for a $50! Not cool at all! In all honesty the only thing this place is good for is drinks. I'm very disappointed in it ! I should have saved the money and walked over to Crabby Bills! [REVIEW_2] by far the WORST effort at chain mexican food. I thought this was a sister restaurant of the The Lime ( now called the Green Lemon)  and gave it a shot.  Terrible food. My wife gave me a bit of her guacamole and it tasted like water mush. one their smoky salsas tasted metallic.   DO NOT GO!!! [REVIEW_3] Horrible service and food. Service was terrible. The management staff seemed to congregate at the wait station and chat with the servers in an unprofessional manner. At 8:30 on a Friday night the clean up guy was dragging rug mats thru the dining area. [REVIEW_4] Do Not Come to this Place! The shrimp was disgusting you can even taste the dirt inside it.  It took the 20 min to serve it. And took them another 20 min for the gumbo. Most horrible is no service at all! None! I sit in the bar for 10 min no one serves me! Even after I ask the bar tender many times he took my order with a shitty face; I got no water no Fock knife no nothing the guy next to me even yelled at them to get service. I asked the woman from the kitchen sending gumbo for water she said as kinda surprised and said"" you want water?"" Oh yeah should I is she dumb?   The bar tender was busy counting money and cold as as ice; the other guy grilling oyster is ridiculous as well. And oh boy the food is way over priced for the poor quality.  And the bar tender dare to have the face asking for 20% tip.  To the manager you should first fire the bar tender and then fire the chef; probably in the end fire yourself for hiring such horrible people! [REVIEW_5] Just visited Station 52 today for lunch and was disappointed.  Food was mediocre at best. The nachos were a joke; the salsa is not fresh; all food seems to be frozen and reheated. They display specials on a blackboard as you enter but fail to mention they are only valid at the bar. Found this out once we received the bill. My wife ordered the Greek chicken pita which comes with fries and she asked to have old bay fries instead of standard fries. We get the bill and they charged us for a basket of old bay fries and when questioned why the charge for a basket; they said the Greek Pita came with chips but we didn't even get the chips.  The waitress then says ""oh I thought you wanted to sub fries for the chips"" then why did we get charged the full amount for the basket of fries; there should have been some discount if it was a sub. The waitress completely forgot my drink refill and brought it out with the check about 10-15 minutes after she took my glass. Overall very bad experience; won't be back.",0
25,"[REVIEW_1] Wonderful way to enjoy a few hours on the water for a good price.  Crew was fantastic and nice selection of soft drinks and beer and snacks.  Having gone 5 times; they are consistently on the ball.  Manatees; dolphins even sharks were pointed out.  Definitely do the sandbar tour; well worth it; and bring water shoes to avoid stepping on shells;etc if you can but not a requirement.  No bathing suit needed. [REVIEW_2] This place has everything you need for buying gifts; and plenty of stuff you don't need (or didn't know you needed until you see it). It's got all the knick-knacks a person could ever want; which makes it the perfect place to purchase fun gifts. From candles to jewelry; locally made shirts and wallets to posters; prints; and coffee mugs; this place is the perfect place to peruse on a visit to Mass Ave or the perfect spot to stop for a gift for a host; birthday; graduation; or anything else.   I was tempted to think that I'd be able to find things in the store that I wanted and order them online cheaper; but Silver in the City already has good prices (with shipping; few things were cheaper online). I love it here! [REVIEW_3] The guy checking you out is horrible.  He seemed high to me. It took almost 20 minutes to get through the 'exit' gate.  When I went to return the car I was distracted and forgot to fill it. I asked the attendant where I could go; and he was helpful.. AS I went to leave; I told the gate guy (ironically the same one) what the attendant told me to say. I have a contract that started last Sunday; and I just need to head out to refuel. The guy gave me deer in headlights; and said... ""what do you mean re-fuel"".  I said; I forgot.... and need to fill the car  up before I turn it in.""  -What do you mean fill it up?   Do you have a contact.... then 5 minutes......... Really [REVIEW_4] It always has a strong smell when you open the door plus they aren't friendly or approachable at all.. .I will never go in there again [REVIEW_5] I really don't bother with negative reviews; but this time an exception has to be made.  I'd like to follow up on Elsa H.'s review of this place; since I was a member of the family being threatened with police action over trying to purchase a lamp.  I've visited this store many times (it's only a few blocks from our house--we live in the Garden District / Irish Channel); and have had no small share of weird or rude encounters.  Previously; it was decidedly unfriendly looks from the staff; noting encounters with patrons who wanted to keep their purses rather than surrender them at the front counter; etc.  I continued to visit; however; because there's a certain sort of eclectic ""junk pile"" vibe here and some genuinely interesting stuff. This time; the epic unfriendliness of the staff was directed squarely at us; however.  One detail omitted from the previous description of this encounter is when Elsa tried to diffuse the situation with the female owner; the husband (?); rather than trying to also diffuse the situation and (perhaps?) sell something; immediately not only made the ""tell the police to hurry up"" remark  but also tried to throw additional and unrelated fuel on the fire; and blame the kids for breaking things.  Since they were picking vintage comic books for purchase with me; in a different area of the store; and the lamp was on a high shelf elsewhere; that's a little hard to digest.  I'd also like to reinforce how nice it was to have other patrons who were also going to buy things simply leave the store and follow us next door to La Davina (highly recommended gelato) to discuss what happened.  If you're visiting New Orleans and looking for antiques; I strongly encourage you to check out the other offerings on Magazine St.  If you're a local; I think it's obvious that except possibly as an anti-gentrification move; we really don't want a visitor's experience on the otherwise fantastic Magazine St. stretch to include this sort of abuse.  And finally; if you're considering consigning your merchandise to be sold by this store; I encourage you to first be an observant ""customer""; and decide if you believe anything will actually be sold at all; given the attitude of the owners.  There are better choices.   Please don't support this horrible store.  And in summary; it's unfortunate that Yelp doesn't allow zero-star reviews.",2
26,"[REVIEW_1] This place doesn't want your business!! Try to call in a take-out order and they'll ignore the phone; direct you to their app (they've actually refused to take my order over the phone) or require a credit card to place an order. Going there is no picnic either. Your clothes will smell like you worked the kitchen. Bring headphones if you do go because there's no music and the noise is deafening. Constant noise from the fry cutting machine and sirens going off when fries are done. The burgers taste OK but the fries are greasy and undercooked. Expect diarrhea. I tried to give zero stars but Yelp doesn't allow that! [REVIEW_2] I tried this nail salon for the first time last week.  I found everyone there to be very friendly and helpful.  I had a gel manicure and had my eyebrows waxed - both were done by Thuy who is the owner; or one of the owners.  I was very happy with the results and we will be back!  The salon itself is beautiful and decorated in a mostly white palette and is minimalist in design - the place looks very clean and sleek.    They haven't been open very long (probably around a year) and the owner is a young woman building a local business.  Give them a try! [REVIEW_3] A few years ago my parents; my brothers and i went to this restaraunt for my birthday. We ordered the usual huge spread because we love thai food. But there was a surprise in the tea. A roach; swimming around. The server brought a new pot (no apology) and that was all. No taking the tea off the bill; no acknowledgement of what happened; nothing. We haven't eaten there since. [REVIEW_4] Went for Taco Tuesday. They were also having an event; and having just opened; I was a little worried. However; everything was great; the servers tried their hardest to make us happy.  PS: this is more Texmex style; not authentic. Keep that in mind. [REVIEW_5] I wanted to really like this place; but it was very underwhelming. The service was very slow. It took 15 minutes to get a cup of black coffee. When I asked for a refill; they said ""Yes; but it is 75 cents."" You spend $3 dollars on a small cup of coffee without a refill??? I ordered the sausage; egg; and cheese biscuit with home fries. The sausage had no flavor and the food was not warm.",2
27,"[REVIEW_1] Was the second patient in the door. Still waited over a half an hour to be seen. Saw the nurse (not practitioner) for a total of 5 minutes and had a throat swab which took another half an hour. $1100. No thanks; I'll not be back. [REVIEW_2] quite the professional response Caroline.  yes i do have quite a palate. eating off the streets of Manhattan for years makes one quite the critic.  salty=too much freaking salt. do you understand this?  and medium lamb doesn't mean a plate of blood you reject.  grow up and take criticism well; you are a small/ok place-  deal with it. [REVIEW_3] We took a trip to New Orleans for spring break/my son's 11th birthday.  One of our excursions was the Swamp Tour; our guide was Capt. Troy.    Please please please take this tour.  When I say it was awesome; that is an understatement.  Capt. Troy provided us with a wealth of information.  He was very patient and answered every question that was asked.  I am  a Swamp People (the reality show) fan and I learned stuff that was totally different than the show....oh AND we were on Honey Island; how cool is that.   If you take a trip to the Bayou make sure you book a swamp tour through Cajun Encounters; you will NOT be disappointed from beginning to end. [REVIEW_4] The pictures online were better than the in-person experience. The price that we paid per night did not match the expectation.  For starters; it would be nice to be greeted by any employee at the front desk when wheeling my luggage through the front door. They seemed busy with other more important things.  Cleanliness; I would rate this a ""B""; maybe. We ended up cleaning the room before we unpacked since room services were not available to remedy. They left us a spray bottle with cleaning solution.  The hallways had an odd odor smell.  The room air was so dry that we had to purchase a humidifier to help with the breathing at a local drug store.  The facility seems ""aged"" and in need of a renovation. For example; our room's curtain rod valences were falling off the wall; barely hanging by 2 screws.  The in-room clothing iron had melted plastic residue on the metal grates. I literally stained my white business shirt with someone else's mess.  The continental breakfast was subpar and was nothing as advertised. I am not sure what was in the eggs and sausage but did not taste ""fresh"".  If we were not in such a hurry; we would have packed up and drove a few more miles down the street to the nearest competitor. [REVIEW_5] We went for lunch on Saturday.  They only serve from a brunch menu.  It was very disappointing.  They really need to re-think the brunch menu and serve items from their good at.  I never had dinner her although I would assume it is better than the brunch items.  I had the meatball omelette which was just ok.  I would say anywhere else would have better omelets. My husband had the burger with an egg on it.  He thought it was good but there are better burgers out there.  I should have went with my gut instinct after seeing the brunch menu but decided to stay since it was Joe Madden's restaurant.  I say skip this place and go down the street to Goody Goody.",1
28,[REVIEW_1] I absolutely love this place and think is easily the best burrito shop in town. Great salsas; relaxed atmosphere; excellent service and price;  Most importantly the burritos are delicious. The chicken and chorizo combo is  my personal favorite but the smoked brisket is great as well. The medium burrito is plenty unless you are training for an eating event.  Family owned; not a chain and it shows in the attention to flavor. Highest recommendation if you are interested in good; healthy food (unless you eat yourself into oblivion) at a reasonable price. [REVIEW_2] Do not get the rice bowl unless you really are more interested in the vegetables than the fish.  I chose the spicy tuna tartar which was a small dollop of unrecognizable fish cut with jicama; which you don't realize until too late and realize the small portion of fish is really an even smaller portion of fish.  Adding insult to injury; the fish; sauces and pickled veggies didn't even taste that great.   I also realized too late they have poke bowls which is what I had in mind; but dare I come back.  I doubt it. [REVIEW_3] Every time we go to this place; we go because of the enticing beer selections; but time after time we leave disappointed by a complacent bar staff that makes you feel like an inconvenience. It's such a shame. The beer selection is second to none; but this time we had one drink and decided to spend our money elsewhere for dinner. This place has been consistent for sure; every time we go; we get a miserable bartender who seems like they'd rather be working on a slow night when they don't have to talk to people. All of the enticing beer in the world won't bring us back.   The owners brother has a great place a few miles away; Brickside Grill; we went there instead...good beer; excellent food and the staff is consistently friendly and engaging! [REVIEW_4] The girls behind the counter are so delightful and nice. Treat you nicer than your family! Help you get what you like! I also got a grilled cheese. It's nice to try the local delights.   Stevie Nicks playing overhead.   My grilled cheese is a work of art. I'm already excited af. The cheese was real not velveeta. Very very beautiful and comforting. It came with sea salted potato chips.  The ice tea was made fresh. The taste is refreshing & exceedingly delish.   Free WiFi too... so you can Yelp! [REVIEW_5] Unassuming location. Friendly staff. Neighborhood vibe. I was at first a little hesitant about ordering 10 to 15 dollar plates at dinner for a casual night out for Mexican food; but when the food was placed before us; beautifully plated; I got lost in the excitement of the first taste. Quality ingredients and balanced spices with  the meats cooked just right kept me high on flavors until our plates were licked clean! I will be back to taste more! Another review might be in order to list my favorite dishes; but I have a feeling that I'll be happy with the entire menu.,3
29,[REVIEW_1] The best cheese steaks around! Such nice and friendly staff don't think I have ever had any issues [REVIEW_2] Amazing! My 7 month old pup apparently got into something like a typical beagle and ended up with massive tummy aches which happened while I was sleeping. I woke up to a wonderful fecal Pollick all over my apartment. Ugh. I was looking for someone who had was reasonable and could come in asap and THS responded to me quick and scheduled me as soon as they could.   Today I received a text from Jeff saying he had a cancellation and would I want him to come sooner... ummm YES! He was great with my dogs; and was quick and efficient. My carpets look better then they did when I moved into this place! I highly recommend THS for any carpet cleaning needs! [REVIEW_3] The pizza had no taste and the wings that I ordered didn't even come buffalo; they came plain which I know for a fact I asked for mild wings... even the chicken was flavorless. Won't be ordering again. [REVIEW_4] Dr Kaplan is smart; knowledgable; and very personable. My wife and I have been coming here for two years. The staff is very accommodating as well. We have seen Dr Charles Kaplan and NP Lana Kessler and are very happy with both of them. Great practice! Highly Recommend! [REVIEW_5] We had a fantastic stay at Hotel Monaco. We got a great deal on Hotwire - $100 a night! - a heavy discount on the normal price for a twin. The experience was so good however; that we'd be more than tempted to pay the full price if we're in town again; it was that good.   Every staff member we met was exceptionally good; and lived upto the reputation of the City of Brotherly Love and Sisterly Affection!  Kirsten on front desk was an absolute delight - when she discovered it was our first time in Philadelphia she gave us a free upgrade which was an unexpected gesture; so we had a larger room and a wonderful view of Independence Hall where the Declaration of Independence was signed and the US constitution was drafted. The room must have just been redecorated; it was spacious; colorful and quirky - and spotlessly clean.  Free happy in the lobby and lounge for an hour made a great pre dinner tipple - they served a good selection of craft beer; wine and because it was so cold hot hard cider. Very nice!  We didn't eat at the hotel; going out for dinner and breakfast but the restaurant and bar looked very nice and I'm sure we'd have been happy to eat there had we wished.  In short: if every hotel I ever stayed in for the rest of my life was like this one; I'd be more than happy. We'll certainly return to Hotel Monaco when we next visit Philly.,4
30,[REVIEW_1] This place has a northern California vibe. Reminds me of breweries in napa. Very open large space and a good selection of craft beer. The other side is a winery which is neat as well.   I recommend trying their flight of beers to get a taste of everything. [REVIEW_2] I dig this place because I feel so far from STL when I'm here!  It's smokey and loud and tons of great stuff on the walls.  I love bars like this that don't look like they're trying too hard.  It's a place where people outside boring Midwest norm can be comfortable!  Looking forward to coming back soon [REVIEW_3] Great place; I had a moment to swing in as I walked from M.O.B.S Barbershop while I was taking a straight razor class from Franco.  I was in a hurry to catch the boat at the wharf for a sunset sail;  so I didn't get to stay long.  I will return to just vacation next time. Great atmosphere and the friendliest people.  Really wanted to stay for the music!!! Love it! [REVIEW_4] Very disappointed :( We came first thing in the morning; but we're rushed through because a group had appointments an HOUR later. The girl didn't clean out my toes; skipped my cuticles; and proceeded to BURN me with her callous sander. For four days I've been walking around with sander induced Blisters and they hurt like heck! She put two coats on my big toe and one on the other toes. The decor is nice; but the staff is unprofessional and need to be trained how to do nails without rushing. You won't get return customers with this level of service. [REVIEW_5] Absolutely fantastic service! I made a last minute appointment for a mani pedi and was taken care of with such ease. My nails look perfect and an extremely relaxing experience overall. Everybody there is very sweet and accommodating :),4
31,[REVIEW_1] Dean's Service was not professional or reliable at all.  I called to get a diagnosis and they got to my rental property and gave me misinformation.  I left messages for Jenny to call me back to get an estimate and a good time to complete the repair and I am still waiting for her to call me back. I had to call another company to do what Dean's Service was unable to do.  I will never call them back again nor would I refer them to anyone. [REVIEW_2] The food is excellent and the service was awesome; and Scot the Executive Chef and Proprietor makes you feel like you are part of the family. I got the grilled oyster and shrimp po'boy; and I asked for the Tabasco mayo. And if you like libations; the Old Fashion is definitely a good choice! Featured on Diners; Drive-Ins; and Dives [REVIEW_3] Meagan is amazing! She fit me in last minute and gave me one of the best deep tissue massages I've ever had. I went in with lower back pain and discomfort and left feeling amazing. She makes it seem easy. She found every sore spot on me and just fixed it all within an hour appointment. She obviously knows her anatomy well. She also has a welcoming and genuine personality. Do yourself a favor and book with her. You won't be sorry. [REVIEW_4] Huge fan; especially since it is right by our apartment. I've always had speedy and friendly  service here. The main allure has to be the breakfast dishes; which I believe I've had in all but one instance; but the burrito on the other visit did the trick too. Get the chilaquiles! Or a skillet or an omelet. Yes; it gets crowded. Maybe they should expand? [REVIEW_5] Can't believe this pit stays open. Like walking into a Fellini set. Disgusting. Dirty.,3
32,"[REVIEW_1] This is one of our favorite spots in Nashville.  It has recently been remodeled and looks great!  The patio can get loud; but other than that no complaints. [REVIEW_2] I've grown up in a Lebanese family and we owned a middle eastern restaurant for over 40 years. The food is everything to me. Their food and pleasentries makes me feel like I'm at my family's table. The smells bring me to sito's (grandmother's) kitchens.  This place is a must for truly authentic food and feel of middle eastern culture.   I've tried a few in Philly; none compare. [REVIEW_3] Can't speak about the food; since we never made it that far. We were seated (near the restrooms/kitchen); while a twosome that entered behind us were seated near the window and allowed to watch the comings and goings along Frenchmen Street. Was told the server would be with us soon. Server walks out from the kitchen and immediately goes to the twosome that came in after us. We were already forgotten before we had a chance to crack open the menus. Added to that; there was a dead cockroach on our table. Food didn't look spectacular enough to make us stay; that; and the dead cockroach was the ultimate deal-killer. Staff should spend more time cleaning up the joint instead of cleaning those fancy fedoras. [REVIEW_4] Absolutely terrible in every aspect.  My fiancé and I came here on a Saturday at 5:45.  All of the waitstaff were standing around the back of the restaurant looking at us awkwardly.  Eventually the bartender greeted us from behind the bar and pointed to the table where we will be seated.  I ordered ""The Cactus"" margarita; and it was salt lime juice and water.  Not a drop of tequila in it.  I'll give it to them that the salsa was good because of the added chipotle.  However; they have the audacity to charge $4 for an extra basket of stale chips.  Our food came out reasonably quick. My fiancé ordered the chicken fajitas and I ordered the 5-Alarm burrito.  Mine was dry as a bone; bland; and not spicey at all.  I'm reasonably sure that they got a frozen burrito from wava and heated it under a panini press.  My fiancée chicken was also dry and just over all bland.  Then came the waiting. We asked our waitress for the check and then she disappeared for 20 minutes.  I asked her again as she passed by our table; and still had to wait another 10 minutes.  It's a different story if they were the only show in town; but this is Main Street manayunk.  There is no reason for places like this to be taking up space if this is the quality and service they are offering. [REVIEW_5] We made reservations; and were seated upstairs about a foot from the band at a table that seemed more like a bar table. After sitting for 45 min with NO SERVICE; just empty glasses and silverware; we left. While leaving the host kindly insisted to grab the manager after we told her what happened. (The hosts were wonderful!)   The manager did nothing besides essentially say that this wasn't typical and to come back.",2
33,[REVIEW_1] Great service and food.  The Whipped Feta was a particularly great starter. [REVIEW_2] Definitely should have read the reviews first.   Ordered $100 worth of pizza for a 13 year Olds birthday.  Gave then 2 hours notice.  The pizza still showed up an hour late; cold and tasteless.  Absolutely awful.    Never again. [REVIEW_3] If i could give it no stars i would.Worst television  service ever!!! I warn you not to go though with direct t.v! I have had problems with them over charging me since the moment I signed up with them. They even sent me to collections for att Wifi service that I didn't even have!!!!! I would stick with Charter Cable! They are wayyyyy better! [REVIEW_4] How can you not like Ted Drewes...I live about a mile away and try not to overindulge. I try to stick with the basic scoop in a cup...I just like the ice cream. Sometimes I get a root beer float if I'm thirstly. Definately the best ice cream anywhere. [REVIEW_5] We all had a great time. We went to watch the football game. We ordered wings; onion rings; and drinks. The server was great; the food was great!! Food on time; drinks on time as well. All tv's were working; sound system was great. We sat outside; and had a great time! It's not our 1st time here; and we love it!!,3
34,"[REVIEW_1] This restaurant was the worst experience that I've had in Indianapolis to date. A coworker and I decided to go to lunch today at a Mexican restaurant that she recommend it. It was my first mind to go somewhere else but I decided to try something new and Yelp something different for a change. Mistake!   Upon entering we saw the sign for the lunch special wish we were both excited about; hey $5.99! We sat down and the waitress seemed friendly. She showed us the lunch menu. I decided to get the taco special and 1 chicken tamale to try (im still seachung for great tamales). Of course like a few other places that I have been too lately; my waitress comes from the kitchen to announce no tamles are ready for today.  Interesting because it's noon and you don't have my ready but you opened at 11am... #ICant  I let it go (and took off a star); getting ready for my  taco lunch with onions and cilantro extra cheese. It came out in due time  only to find out I was not very happy with the food at all. Actually took me a little while to eat my second taco. The positive thing about the meal was the portions. The two tacos were large. It just did not taste like authentic Mexican tacos. It tastes like something that I could easily make at home. American best-try kind-of tacos. Another star gone.   We ready to go soon enough and we ask for separate check which the waiter said that she could do. However she did not bring out separate checks. In fact my coworker had to ask how much her meal was. The waitress had to go back and count up for her total and then come back and tell her how much the her portion was. Well knowing that I only spent about $7 in the restaurant I did not think I needed to do the same. Mistake. I was very surprised when found out my meal was almost $11 when my card was ran. Apparently it was extra for the cilantro onion even know the meal came with tomatoes and lettuce which I asked for instead. Never was told it was extra. I knew I had to pay for extra chees; but dang!  Management came out upon my request to give me a breakdown of the bill; especially since I couldn't get itemized bill. I was not happy; not buying the explaination; nor impressed. They give me a small; change of a refund and vowed to NEVER be back.   No tamales; no detailed bill; no prior knowledge of changes would be extra; food not great at all... Yeah; you have ok decor and yes you smiled but service is lacking; never again. #EpicEpicEpicFail [REVIEW_2] I've been here a handful of times; and bagels have always been delicious. I visited the shop on 5/19/18; and this will be my last visit. I went there because I was hungry and in need of food; but it seemed like I walked into the middle of classic P.T. Barnum show: clowns juggling while riding unicycles and elephants parading around on their hind legs. The first employee I interacted with; at the ""bulk"" bagel counter; didn't hesitate to let me know that I was attempting to order from the wrong location. Fair enough. They did have a sign on the counter; but it wasn't as conspicuous as an ""order here"" sign that dangles from the ceiling. Her tone made it clear to me that I had already committed one transgression. I then order from the attendant at the POS. I clarified my complicated order of a breakfast sandwich and two toasted everything bagels with a tomato and garlic cream cheese; three times. The first clarification was that I wanted everything bagels; not plain. The second  clarification was directed toward me because they actually have garlic and herb cream cheese; not garlic cream cheese. The third was my reiteration of the tomato and the quantity of the said bagels. At this point I had more confidence in a drunk ESL Uber driver getting me home safely than my order being prepared as per my request. After waiting for my extravagant order to be prepared to imperfection and gazing at the yellow ceiling grid with stalactites of black dust; my name was called and the first employee I interacted with hastily handed me my bagel bag. On the ride home I asked my partner in crime to ensure that there were 3 bagels in the bag because they probably ""F-ed"" the order up. He assured me that the quantity was correct. When I got home; I feverishly ripped open the wrapping on the two everything bagels; like a joyous child on Christmas Day; only to find     that the bagels had the tomatoes omitted and the cream cheese barely exceeded a skim coat. The breakfast sandwich was anemic at best with barely any protein on it. I am so glad that I expected disappointment. Honestly I'm not too upset because closer to my house there is a new bagel shop: Red House bagels; where the staff is courteous; the shop is cleaner; and the bagels a bit larger. Red House is my new bagel stop.  Sorry Newtown Bagel Co; you've been replaced. Although your actual bagels are slightly better tasting; it is not enough to reconcile the pain points associated with your operations. My words of advice; replace (don't clean) your ceiling tiles and clean the filth from the grid. Having almost 10 years of food and beverage experience; I would hate to see what your walk-in and floors behind the counter look like. Coach your employees on courteous service; or maybe treat them better and they might pass that on to your patrons. Oh and maybe write the orders down before entering them into the POS; because sometimes those machines aren't as navigable for some operators. I'd like to keep going on about this; but I am probably beating an already abused P.T. Barnum animal. [REVIEW_3] Gave this store one star only because I had to in order to post a review. Went here last week to get a new phone. Service was indifferent to say the least. Staff was condescending and barely polite. Not a good experience. [REVIEW_4] The staff is very good at providing misinformation with; what I can only guess is; the objective of stretching out simple things into multiple; billable appointments. Be sure to show up on time so you can have the honor of waiting for netley d'souza to stroll by; in an unapologetic fashion; 45 minutes after your scheduled appointment. A word of caution; though. Do not suggest that his staff treat you with decency or that anyone other than yourself be punctual. Doctor d'souza will respond by having a staff member call you to tell you to find another doctor. If you're looking for integrity; punctuality; consideration for your time; a competent staff; a doctor who is on top of his game; or anyone to do anything other than give you a hard time or do more than the bare minimum; well; I guess you had better keep looking. [REVIEW_5] I found this center to be very honest; ethical; and competent.  Had a transmission problem with my BMW 2003 over the holidays. BMW Dealership wanted to replace it and charge me a fortune. Cottman was able to fix the transmission and save me the cost of getting a new one.  Highly recommended.",1
35,"[REVIEW_1] Stopped in for breakfast on our way to the French Quarter. I had a Build Your Own Scramble with cheddar cheese; andouille sausage and mushrooms. It came with a biscuit and breakfast potatoes (yum). Boyfriend got the Andouille Eggs Benedict; it looked and tasted wonderful. Bits of crawfish in there as well! Tasted fresh! [REVIEW_2] If I could rate them less than one star I would. I had the worst experience here. I felt discriminated against; disrespected; and attacked. The place was over crowded because they over sold tickets. We were asked to move from where we were standing because it would block the dancers from walking by. However; they brought out chairs from the back for other people to sit in that same exact spot. The second time we were asked to move because a couple wanted to sit behind us and couldn't see. A woman then turned a chair around and told one of my friends that the seat wasn't for her in a very rude tone. Next; two girls came in and stood directly in front of me which was also directly in front of the doorway where the dancers were supposed to enter; a server came to us and asked us to move again but said nothing to the two girls. We stated that we could not move where he wanted because then we would be blocking the view of the customers already standing there so he then asked us to move to the back of the bar where we would not be able to see anything. After that the rude woman (who told my friend the seat wasn't for her) had her husband tap my friend and ask could she switch places with me because she was too tall and blocking everyone's view. There was no room for us to switch spots so I said no and continued to try to watch the ""show.""  He then tapped her again and asked did she want to sit down; she said no she was fine. He proceeded by pushing the chair into the back of her legs and forcing her to sit down. There was no staff around to assist us with these issues and there was hardly any room to try to find someone so we left before things got anymore out of hand. As we stood outside getting ready to leave a couple that lived next door overheard us talking about how disrespected we felt they chimed in and said that many of the people there are impolite and rude. I will never again in my life recommend nor visit this establishment. [REVIEW_3] I stumble upon this place during a day trip to Reno.  This sporting good store is well stocked with guns; gun accessories; and fishing gear.  Too bad that I was short on time; otherwise I could have spent more time browsing around.  It was interesting to walk around and check out all their real stuft animals on display from around the world.  Their customer service is really great; and their staff is knowledgeable and friendly.   It is really great to know that Big Box stores like Cabelas and Sportsmart did not drive out all of the smaller guys.  I will go back there on my next trip to Reno. [REVIEW_4] This review is about the receptionist.  Normally I have a decent experience here; but this morning I  called to schedule an appt for the same night at 7:45. The lady up sold me on a special; said ""see you tonight;"" and we ended our conversation.   Got to the salon and was informed my services were scheduled for tomorrow; not tonight. Well; im going away tomorrow; so that is just not going to work. The girl at the desk was very unapologetic and made it sound like it was my fault. They were 100% booked; which I understand; but she offered no real sorry or anything.  I just walked out feeling pretty stupid; although they should be the ones feeling stupid.   Will start taking my business elsewhere. [REVIEW_5] It took me over a year after I moved to St. Louis to finally make the decision that I could not fly back to my home state of New Jersey every time I needed my hair cut and colored.  So I bid adieu to my stylist back home; and started my St. Louis search.  After asking a friend's mom; whose hair always looks fabulous; she pointed me to Studio Branaca; and my stylist Steve.  What a blessing!  He is an amazing stylist and all around good guy.  He really knows how to work with your hair and is honest about what he things will look good based on your face shape; coloring etc.  He also pointed me in the direction of Julie; my colorist.  Now I must digress and say that I trust my stylists totally...I mean that is their job; right.  So I put myself in their hands...which; with color; can be risky.  Well; there was nothing to worry about because Julie does great color...really thinking about the time of year; what you're looking for; etc.  I've recommend everyone that is looking for a new stylist to go here; you won't be disappointed.",3
36,"[REVIEW_1] The food was outstanding.  I got chicken tagine; with the delicious tender meat falling off the bone; and carrot salad; flavored with mint and cumin.  Service was good; and the inside of the restaurant is cheerful and well-lit.  Total cost was around $13. [REVIEW_2] Someone is ""salting"" this place ... what I mean is; if you are giving this joint even the sightest positive nod you are either a family member of the owner or you have been living in the Sudan for the last ten years (no offense to the Sudanese but if you have been there.. ) This restaurant was good years ago .. NOW = Old food that does not get replentished unless you beg (where the F is the board of health?) My wife goes for the Crab Legs (ALL YOU CAN EAT MY EYE) .. they actually have the nerve to post a hand written sign taped over the very small cab leg pan that reads ""please take only 3 or 4 legs ..be considerate to others"" What it should read is  ""Please take only 3 or 4 crab legs because we want to capture more of your money by not having to repentish the crab legs"" .... the propieters are very nice; but their actions are not appropriate .. Perhaps they should just close down and do something else .. or do something right. [REVIEW_3] Have been here many times and always had a great experience. When we moved to Rita Ranch 6 months ago my husband and I did a lot of rehab work on our new house and would go almost once a week to recover from the week's ""work-out"". It's always clean; they never gyp you on time; take the time to work on problem areas. Felicia is the best. Highly recommend them!   Update...neck really bothering me so I went in and had the best therapeutic massage with Felicia. It was amazing! She is truly talented. [REVIEW_4] I really had a wonderful experience at the Nashville location; and we found out that New Orleans had one now and should go to it. Last night we got there kinda late around 10pm. Sat there for 10min and not one person greeted us. Went to the bar to see about service and she informed that the kitchen was behind on completing orders.  I had to apologize to my friends that we may not get any food after driving three hours down to enjoy the weekend. We did end up leaving the restaurant after 25 min wait for no service or an apology.   I have to say this not what I expected from a big known place for adults to have fun along with kids also. Please do something about this. I hope this is not a reflection of how others could become. [REVIEW_5] I read at least 30 reviews before I decided to eat here. The only thing that was good was the oysters because it's raw. Everything else was dry and tasteless. The space is cramp. We had people on our backs coughing on us while sitting at the bar trying to enjoy it. Let's just say the 2 half and half baskets that my boyfriend and I ordered was not worth $60.",2

[REVIEW_2] Awful awful awful went in today to have lunch with my husband we ordered we get to the register and they inform us there's no ice for the drinks we ordered do we still want them I say yes because I made the wrongful assumption that the soda would at least be cold and drinkable boy was I wrong not only was it hot but it had no carbonation what so ever. Now mine you we paid for these drinks I don't know about you but I've worked in the food industry and my store has ran out of ice before and we went to the grocery store and bought bags of ice brought them back and made sure our customers were happy until we could fix the situation apparently that was not the managers idea at this store. So instead of just saying sorry our drink situation sucks today u can have it for free they charge us. I went to 5 guys and got us cold drinks we started eating our burritos were disgusting they tasted like cat food and the chips were completely plain no lime or salt at all! Clearly someone has dropped the ball at this chipotle because it was complete garbage! I hope they can turn this store around because they've now lost a customer [REVIEW_3] Friday's  Bartender must own the place;  be related to the owner;   or have pictures  of someone in charge............What an Arsehole!!!!;  How does this guy stay in business??;  the attached  bowling alley must be the answer..............avoid this place;   bowling alley is great though;  what a shame [REVIEW_4] Soo disappointed. Ordered delivery and specified that it was from a hotel. They brought no utensils and told them I did not specify them. They changed my order without asking me. The kicker was that the Biryani I ordered had hard things in it; some of which were whole cardamon pods but also (and yuck) a partially eaten stone fruit. Please don't get delivery. If anything eat there; but I will not [REVIEW_5] Inspect your food before you put it in your mouth! Ordered the Spicy Tuna Roll last night and am now battling the worst case of food poisoning the world has ever known - think projectile vomiting- . The tuna was mushy and the color was too dark; like it had been sitting out at room temperature all day. This place needs to be inspected. Avoid this place.",0
38,"[REVIEW_1] A few years ago my parents; my brothers and i went to this restaraunt for my birthday. We ordered the usual huge spread because we love thai food. But there was a surprise in the tea. A roach; swimming around. The server brought a new pot (no apology) and that was all. No taking the tea off the bill; no acknowledgement of what happened; nothing. We haven't eaten there since. [REVIEW_2] The restaurant smelled like a toilet.  I couldn't stand it.  My daughter and I got the meals to go and the guy put them in the same box.  She doesn't eat fish and that is what I got.  I know it's a sushi restaurant but she likes the California rolls.  I got the spicy tuna roll.  It was mediocre.  My daughter did enjoyed hers.  Will not be going back. [REVIEW_3] i've trained casually at various MMA gyms in the LA area and decided to try out Paragon at the recommendation of a friend. although I had ""trained"" before; going to a new gym is always nerve-wracking when you are not yet familiar with the setup... where do i put my bag? should I be wearing muay-thai shorts? is anyone wearing a mouth guard? how in shape am i REALLY? will i or will i not be the worst one in the class? suffice it to say; my anxiety was misplaced. the atmosphere at Paragon is so friendly and unpretentious (refreshing; after exposure to some more uppity LA gyms). i took a saturday am all-levels kickboxing class with Tyson; who leads a damn good workout and helps you with technique. it was a perfect mix of cardio and sparring combinations. needless to say i was the-good-kind-of-sore come sunday.   gym quality is top notch. they had apparently just put in new mats which looked and felt great. the gym is huge so there was plenty of room for solid training; and everything was super clean.   special hats off to the owner; Sean. he was really welcoming when I first awkwardly stumbled in. you can seriously tell how engaged he is with the gym and its members. he seemed to know everyone by name; regardless of whether they're gunning for their black belt; or just looking for a good weekend workout. [REVIEW_4] This vet is the best! I took my 5 month old puppy in to get spayed. They could not have been more kind; from the receptionist to the doctor. And they brushed her out and clipped her nails while she was out! I'm a very worrisome doggy mom and I felt very confident leaving Doris in their care. She healed up beautifully and we had no troubles at all. Highly recommend this vet [REVIEW_5] It has been a long time since we ate here. But we were getting tired of the same-old; same-old and the husband suggested we try it again. What a mistake. The place looks old and tired. NO atmosphere. But the service was prompt and friendly. We ordered our meals.... fish and chips for me and an open-faced roast beef sandwich for my husband. My dish arrived with three healthy  pieces of scrod in a very eggy looking breading. Fake fries (you know; reconstituted potato parts shaped like fries) and a very mayonnaise - y tartar sauce. The fish was edible. The fries were not. But the real surprise was the horrendous meal my husband was served. Instead of beautiful roast beef; he received fatty; chewy brisket; shiny gravy and those awful excuses for fries. We should have been suspicious when they offered neither a baked potato nor mashed potatoes. Nevertheless; he dug in. He hated the dish and ate very little of it. The waitress questioned him about it and he said he didn't like it.   She came back to tell us that the meat came from the end of the roast (thus the overcooked texture and heavy fat content). Even as we paid the bill; the owner apologized for serving such a lousy cut of beef. Then why serve it???? It makes no sense. In the meantime; my fish was just passable. Not inedible... but not very good.   They did reduce the bill and gave us a $5 off coupon. But too little too late. If you hurry; you will find the coupon in the entrance to the restaurant.   We won't be back; so you are welcome to use it. Though I wouldn't recommend that you do.",2
39,"[REVIEW_1] Got some delicious dinner from here and it was just as good as the other Chipotles I've been to. I got a vegan burrito bowl with a side of corn tortillas. It was very good. [REVIEW_2] Visiting from out of town. Went to the Florida Aquarium and found this place after. Fantastic pizza!  Great service! If you like NY-style pizza; definitely give them try. The [REVIEW_3] We found Benny based on his yelp reviews.  We were in town to catch a cruise and after a red eye from California figured we could both use ""tuneups"".  The appointments were easy to make via email/text and I have to say he is an absolute gem of a find.  We scheduled a follow up appointment on our way out of town.   The best way I'd describe his work would be intense neuromuscular.  Relaxing it was not (although my boyfriend had a more relaxing experience) he did some intense release on my quads; hamstrings and glutes that did an amazing job on my sciatica.  Thank you Benny we will be back anytime we are in town.  I can't recommend this amazing healer highly enough! [REVIEW_4] Everyone with bad reviews needs to know this place is a bistro. Service was great; friendly; and entertaining. We enjoyed the bacon sampler; which was amazing. had the bacon cappuccino which was different but good! Recommend this to my fello baconeers! [REVIEW_5] The food was great; the service was quick; and the drinks were delicious. The servers have tablets now and it makes the food come out faster--someone actually brought drinks to our table while our server was still telling us about appetizers; how cool!",5
40,"[REVIEW_1] Came in at 9:59 am when they open at 10 am; door was unlocked and everything but they lady was very rude and told us they weren't open. Walked out a couple steps turned around and she had flicked the open sign on. Decided not to walk back because of the poor customer service. [REVIEW_2] Sad!  Last time eating here.  Over priced; over cooked; under staffed!  Salad ok butt charged $2 for extra anchovies (4 total).  No background music in seating area so we could hear everything the cooks and staff did all weekend but they never ask if we needed anything.  The management has now called me a ""sad little man"" in her response.  I'm not sad just disappointed in a chain restaurant that use to be good.  You should be the one apologizing for the bad food.  And yes that young man was nice butt by then my lunch was already ruined by that horrible excuse of a roast pork sandwich. [REVIEW_3] I have read some of the other reviews and should have read them before trying this place.  Eating should be enjoyable.  I have started eating at Jade Garden at Hillsborough and Habana.  Definitely worth the drive to get some quality Chinese food. [REVIEW_4] No longer liking china king.  Now that abacus delivers; we no longer get china king.   The food quality is okay.  We had a couple of pretty weak dishes.  Used to like the Hunan chicken and Hunan shrimp.  But last couple of times we ordered; we were disappointed in the quality and flavor. [REVIEW_5] They've yet to get even my most basic of orders right (iced black coffee); and when I do order specialty coffees; they suck. I ask for extra espresso every time and even though they'll charge me for it; they rarely add it. Specialty Lattes? They'll taste like mostly milk. Service is also mediocre. They will give me the correct drink if I drive back; but who wants to have to drive back every time? Not to mention it comes with a side of attitude.   Whoever is running this place; please get it together.",0
41,[REVIEW_1] My first time coming here was super awesome. So I decide to bring my Mom for my second visit. Unfortunately I was so disappointed and mad that I took my mom here for lunch. We waited for about an hour for our food and they even manage to messed it up.  Might come back for the drinks but not for the food. [REVIEW_2] This place has an awesome ambiance and great wine! It was the perfect place to come for my bday! [REVIEW_3] 11/4 Usually you go to an automatic and prepare your self to be told you need more than what's wrong. Not here. Sean  gave me his honest opinion and quoted me on exactly what I needed gave me best and worst case financial scenarios and booked my appointment. I really appreciate his honesty.   Being a woman driving an expensive car people try to get over on you. Not here I would recommend this place hands down   11/06 I was waiting on a call back today to get my car fixed because on Saturday one of the guys hurt his hand and my piece still needed to be ordered so we had to schedule an appointment . I never received the call so I figured I'd call because I understand people get busy and forget things; I get it. However when I called and explained a little bit about the situation Nick said sure come in; with not fully understanding what was going on before I agreed to take a 30 min drive I asked him did the piece come in? His reply was no. I immediately asked  why am I coming in then? He said he'll look around for the part and call me back. Long story short. I go in because he said the part has arrived. I get their I tell him of my time restrictions he said it was a 3 1/2 hour job and  assured me it will be fixed today at 4:30pm Because I was dropping the car off at 12pm. I receive a call at 3:57 pm with nick telling me that the car not only isn't ready but the original stated problem isn't even the problem and that the car won't be ready until tomorrow. So that means you were gonna work on the car for 30 min if you just realized at 3:57 that it wasn't the control arm but the shocks; after you told me it was a 3 hour job?? Then told me that my car wouldn't be able to be put together tonight then said it could; he did however order my Uber to get their after ordering it to the wrong address the first time   I was so exited about finding a trustworthy mechanic until this happened   Sean the owner is a great person I'm sure they all are however I no longer trust their judgment. [REVIEW_4] We had the best time at this little find. We walked right up and felt at home. Everyone was so nice & friendly.  The food is typical bar food & nothing to rave about. It's the atmosphere that is what makes this place.  It was hopping due to the seafood festival on the same weekend but the staff acted like it was a normal crowd. [REVIEW_5] Great place; go back all the time! My haircut and color is the best I've had. A fun place to have hair done; everyone is so friendly! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!,3
42,"[REVIEW_1] Great selection. Love the clearance prices that are always around. Definitely enjoy the Starbucks inside. A little peeved at the Target Card hawkers....employees who peruse the store asking shoppers if they ""want to save 10%?"" I think I have been asked 50 times(by the same employee); I already have 2 Target Cards thank you very much and I should not have to hide from employees. [REVIEW_2] Because of recommendations by my hotel at Union Station; I decided to try this place with my  dad and his fiance.  The wait wasn't terrible. However; the food was very plain. You may consider it decent if you paid next to nothing for it.  This however was not the case.... For 3 meals; we paid $120.  Honestly I'll advise you to consider red lobster long before this place. [REVIEW_3] Great restaurant. Very cool and classy decor; a super nice waitress; and excellently prepared dishes.   Food: The prix fixe menu prices were very reasonable with good choices. I especially liked the shrimp and goat cheese crepes - outrageously good. I also liked the pork chops - big; thick; fatty; and tasty. The bread pudding was delicious too.   Service: super attentive and polite and personable waitress.   Ambiance: very cool place; beautiful decor; historic building.   Would definitely return. [REVIEW_4] I have been a client of Stephanie's for many years getting eyelash extensions and have always been happy with her services. She is very professional and I highly recommend. Thank you Stephanie! [REVIEW_5] This was a wonderful find.  Customer service was amongst the best I have had.  I enjoyed the Chicken and Waffles with a side of eggs.   The quality; taste; amd presentation cannot be beat for a breakfast option. Enjoy I know you will :)",4
43,"[REVIEW_1] Mac's is a great place for many things.  They have lots of TV's so its great to watch games; etc. Large beer selection .  Really delicious bar-fare.  They have outside seating which is great for watching the people stroll by and friendly staff!  It's a welcoming place overall. [REVIEW_2] Nice place for lunch and the chefs are really nice. I love the soup; salad and yum yum sauce. [REVIEW_3] Featuring only Canadian ingredients (over 90% of which are sourced in Alberta and BC); the now 11 week old addition to Edmonton's growing 124 St was not far down on my list to eat. Our reservation was for 7pm last Saturday and when we arrived; it was surprisingly not fully seated! A long bar counter actually allows diners to show up without reservations; something I wish I would have known earlier. Large windows made it feel quite open and as the night went on; the dark interior gave it a very trendy atmosphere.  To start; I had my mind set on a Caesar; a truly Canadian drink. I didn't even bother to look at the drinks menu (whoops!) and when I ordered; our server Chris kindly told me they had removed it from the menu. Aperol Spritz then? North 53′s mixologist Brendan Brewster (formerly Woodwork; Manor Bistro); happily accommodated my off menu request.   Joe and I decided to order off the a la carte versus the $85 tasting meu (lowered from the original opening $100); although many tables were doing so. There's just something about being able to choose what to eat!  The ""Various Beets"" has been on the menu for some time now and that's always a sign that it's a winner. Indeed it was. Beets sourced from Riverbend Gardens; done in a multitude of ways: sorbet; pickled; and dehydrated meringue; layered with a goat's cheese mousse; red wine vinaigrette; candied walnuts; and nasturtium (a watercress-like leaf with a peppery taste). Best presentation ever. And incredibly delicious! The beet meringue was the most intriguing; dehydrated to the point that upon contact with moisture (your mouth); it almost dissolved into a burst of beet flavor. What just happened there?!  While I was pondering away on the use of a dehydrator; Joe was trying the duck rillette; which he chose from the menu. Similar to a pate; the Fourwhistle Farm's duck was cooked until tender; shredded and formed; topped with pieces of smoked duck breast; and cherry gelee. Gastriqued cherries along with a cherry and hazelnut puree decorated the rest of the plate. Joe loved the gastriqued cherries and both of us enjoyed the smoked duck breast. More of that; please!  Sauteed carrots came on top of pearl barley risotto; finished with the Cheesiry's pecorino stock; freshly shaved perocrino; and watercress. Sprinkled over top was a dehydrated brown butter powder; giving the dish another layer of seasoning.  The black cod; sourced from Vancouver Island; was done to perfection and supremely moist. Little neck clams and a clam froth were mixed in with the butternut squash puree and roasted butternut squash; although a different server (not Chris) said they were oysters when he brought it out. I really enjoyed this dish and it's because of dishes like these that I'm always keen on ordering a fish entree instead of another protein. I won't know how it compares to the wild boar or milk fed veal sirloin tip until my next visit!  I have learnt that two desserts will always make me happier than one and seeing that we were both 80% full; why not. Chris highly recommended the sunchoke ice cream. This dish is definitely not to be missed! Aside from the creative use of sunchoke; it was placed on a thyme sponge; layered with balsamic vinegar curd and more of the brown butter powder; this time with black malt. The ice cream was very well done; smooth; no crystals of ice and had such a pleasant flavor. The thyme sponge had a... spongey texture. Honestly one of the most interesting things to eat; next to the beet meringue we had earlier. Really starting to wonder what kind of dehydrator they're using back there!  Our second dessert was the wild blueberry sorbet; accompanying a goat's milk panna cotta. On the bottom were dried blueberries; roasted rolled oats; and a blueberry tuile to anchor the dish. All components were gorgeous; and overall the dish was very unsweetened; which can be a nice way to end a meal. The tarragon granite might not be for all; especially if you do not enjoy licorice! I didn't even know tarragon had that natural taste; it's always mixed in with other herbs when I've had it.  Overall; the meal was one of the best that I've ever had. Points all around for presentation; creativity; and taste! It's like an episode on the Food Network. Not only that; the service was excellent and the kitchen was timely with our plates. Chris was extremely knowledgeable on the menu and its ingredients. I had read from some diners that the atmosphere was quite formal; but not so when we went. Quite relaxed in my opinion but they may have eased up; much like the cost of the plates. [REVIEW_4] They never shipped the item and its been 18 days. They don't answer their phone or email and after I leave a message; they don't call back. It seems like they are basically running a scam.  I would avoid dealing with them as they do not fulfill their orders or believe in any customer service. [REVIEW_5] We had dinner at Convivio right after it opened and we will definitely go back. There were a few minor quirks with the service and with wine being out of stock; but I'm chalking it up to the fact that it just opened and they were working out the kinks. The owner visited our table and he could not have been nicer or more gracious. The food was excellent...nothing to change there! I had the tortelloni pansotti; and i think it was the best pasta I've ever had. I'm sure we will be frequent diners .",4
44,[REVIEW_1] Top Hog has the best hamburgers in the universe and their sweet tea will fix anything that ails you. Great people; fantastic food and reasonable prices. Can't beat that!! [REVIEW_2] Extremely great service! So happy I found this hotel. Food is great the drinks are great!! Not only the 24 hour food service! Amani works at front desk... Sweetest girl ever. Defiantly recommend staying here!!! [REVIEW_3] The Steamboat Natchez was excellent! The ride was lengthy and enjoyable and the guide was very informative. We also had access to a lot of the boat and were able to go into the engine room and see how the ship operates. If you are mildly interested in taking a ride on the Mississippi; you won't be disappointed if you ride on Steamboat Natchez. [REVIEW_4] One of my favorite breakfast joints in Nash! Love bringing fam here when I have them in town! Amazing bloody Mary's & biscuits! Well worth the wait; always!! [REVIEW_5] Just awesome! My orange chicken actually had orange peels sautéed with the food! Never seen that before. Will definitely go again,5
45,"[REVIEW_1] I can't comment on the service; as my wife picks this up and brings it home. But I can comment on the food; it's great. It's always fresh and tasty. I love the fiery habanero and usually get it on everything. We get food from here a few times a month; and it has yet to disappoint! [REVIEW_2] Over the summer I ordered from here without incident. Then comes fall and a particularly cold evening.  We placed our order or tried at first. My friend repeated the order three times.  The repeated her card number 2 times.  Then became tired of repeating my address.  I gave them my address the 4th time.  We were told we'd get our Indian goodness in 30 - 45 minutes.  Not a problem.  We were fine with waiting.  We thought the repeating-ourselves-thing was pretty comical until...  Over an hour later we had no Indian goodness.  We called the restaurant.  We let them know the time frame they gave us and that it was well past that time frame.  The person on the phone didn't seem to understand ""we've been waiting over an hour.  Can you tell us if the driver is near?""  Several times.  This time the repetition wasn't comical.  Then came Irate Guy On Phone.  ""DO YOU WANT YOUR FOOD!? DO YOU WANT YOUR FOOD!? WHY DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHERE THE DRIVER IS!? WHY!?""  My friend and I looked at each other as if to ask what just happened while Irate Guy On Phone kept screaming ""DO YOU WANT YOUR FOOD!?;"" Etc.    Driver finally showed up while this phone call was taking place.  My friend collected the food and paid the tab.    The food; mediocre.  Before to night I was fine with waiting to get it on the latter end of the stated time.  Tonight; a little late because of a lovely nor'easter but the person who answered the phone left such a rotten taste in my mouth that next time I will get into my wheels and haul my butt to pick up from a much better restaurant with less abusive service.  Bad service made the mediocre food... meh. Portions or naan and poori: fail.  Yeeeeeaaahhh. No. Will I order take out or delivery again from this establishment? Nope.  In short; Tandoor India; you bite and not the way I like. [REVIEW_3] Top rate service;  nice ambiance;  friendly staff.  We were taken care of from the moment we sat down.  Loved every second.  Good was just as good.  Splurge for the wagyu filet; it's worth it.  As for appetizers; the Kung pao calamari was one of the more intetesting appetizers I have had in awhile;  i loved it.  Amazing sauce. Top marks all around [REVIEW_4] Don't expect housekeeping on a Saturday because this is an extended stay hotel and I wouldn't expect too much from the management either. After several phone calls and no answer from the front desk we just gave up and said never again for this hotel......lesson learned. [REVIEW_5] Wait is not worth it. Almost an hour and they don't seem to have any sense of urgency. And the air conditioning is spotty. It's a good product but I won't be back and they're lucky this is tampa and not Seattle. With this kind of wait; little seating and no air - this place would have never survived in a market with competition. They need to get a better system for serving people if they want to remain open after the new ness wears off. I won't be back and I'm willing to bet this is a lot of people's first and last visit. I wish them well though and want them to succeed. But they have to fix the air and wait times.",2
46,[REVIEW_1] My husband and I have been renting from milpas rental for many years now. If I could give it 6 stars I would. They have anything you can imagine to rent. From scissor lifts to great quality power tools. Their fleet of equipment is always in top shape and never outdated. You not only get amazing customer service every time; but definitely the lowest prices around. Their staff is super knowledgeable and super friendly. When we had our wedding a few years back; we needed extra power for lighting and kitchen equipment; and they were so helpful with leading us towards what size cord we needed and even connectors for all of the lighting.  Keep up the good work Milpas Rental! [REVIEW_2] Delicious food and attentive; friendly service. Our waitress Jessica and bus person Sarah were fantastic!  They checked on us at just the right moment every single time! [REVIEW_3] Truly outstanding food....with among the friendliest and most enthusiastic service I have experienced.  This place is a must and should be on your rotation....  Please support your locally owned businesses !! [REVIEW_4] I visited Just Cookies to get some chocolate chip cookies for a friend and I before a concert at the (awesome) Murat.  Specialty bakeries are the best; unfortunately; this place was the worst.  For cookies at this price; they should be better than the discount day-old cookies at the supermarket..  much better; even!  But these were; somehow; worse.  Not just dry; but bland.  I couldn't believe that a bakery specializing on just one item could do them so poorly.  And while the woman was not explicitly rude; she certainly wasn't friendly either (not even a smile.)  To Just Cookies; I'll Just say No! [REVIEW_5] Used MegaBus for the first time on May2 & 4; 2014. The only thing it has going for it is the price. The driver got lost trying to find the CalTrain station in Sacramento and drove for over one hour on the surface streets of Sacramento; wandering and looking for the station in residential areas. Passengers tried to help her with directions from smart phones; but she wans't interested in any assistance. By the time we pulled into the station over an hour late; we could smell that something was overheating. First the driver claimed it was the system to open the luggage doors; as these were not working and could not be opened to offload and reload passengers luggage. She finally got that to work; and told us we would have to wait for a hot tire to cool off. Eventually all seemed well; and we left. Within 5 minutes of getting on the freeway; the driver yanked the bus over to the side while slamming on the brakes. There was an offramp approzimately 20 feet from the front of the bus; no idea why she didn't pull off the freeway. She announced the same tire was overheating and it was not safe to take the bus to San Francisco. Then she took the offramp and parked in a shopping center. Told us it would take at least an hour for a new bus to be brought to us; plus time to unload and reload the luggage. Meanwhile; the passengers start getting off the bus to smoke; buy a soda at the convenience store; etc. The driver came unglued and ordered everyone back on the bus; no one could stand outside except the smokers that were smoking with her.And the replacement was not a megabus; no wi-fi; etc. The portapotty called a bathroom was filthy; burn your shoes if you have to use it. The trip back was slightly better; also very late and had a stop to explore a smell coming from the bus. After my experience; I will pay to fly Southwest into Oakland and take BART into the city. I have no confidence that these bus drivers could handle a real emergency while driving and did not feel safe.,3
47,[REVIEW_1] Only been here for breakfast but all three times have sat out on the pet-friendly patio; I usually bring my own travel water bowl but forgot it this time and they were happy to provide me with a soup bowl.  Now on to my service; I've always been greeted with a cheery good morning and I absolutely adore the oatmeal. The egg-white; spinach & tomato breakfast sandwich is delicious. [REVIEW_2] Really great customer service; and their pizzas really hit the spot. The crust was baked just right. They also have some really great deal. This is one of the few late night pizza deliveries I would call a second time. [REVIEW_3] I can't say enough good things about this wonderful Sushi restaurant in Riverview!  The staff are incredibly friendly and timely!  The sushi is so fresh and tasty!!  One of my all time favorites!! [REVIEW_4] The best comedy club in Santa Barbara. Okay the only club. But still a great club to come watch a show. Don Friesen was the headliner the day we went and I have seen him several times before at various clubs but never gets old. Super talented and super funny and super impressive since Don is. Totally clean comedian. He has actually won the San Francisco comedy festival twice -the only person to ever have done that with two different hours of material. No I don't work for Don but he always impresses me. The acts from start to finish were terrific. And the food is great which says something bc a lot of comedy clubs just do crappy bar food: i had ahi and oysters which I was hesitating about but had no reason to. The food was greatl. The comedy was great.the staff was great. Run don't walk here. [REVIEW_5] In love with my haircut! Very reasonable prices as well. This is my second time here. The first time the cut and style were amazing but the color was a little off from what I wanted but it still looked good. I will definitely continue to be a returning customer.,5
48,"[REVIEW_1] Vault of Souls is a $50 cover charge to get into an over-priced bar.  The ""experience"" lasts for 20 minutes unlike the escape room.  You are rushed through and spoon-fed the answers in a pitch-black room. If you want to waste your money and buy crappy drinks; be my guest. I say SKIP IT! [REVIEW_2] I've been 3 times; so I think I can share a fair judgement.  This business is a lot of show; without the go.   Service has been the overall department that has been completely lacking along with some breakfast items are products of horrible cooking.  First time: asked for black coffee and a matcha latte; dad didn't get his coffee until our food already arrived (which also seemed to take forever) and I actually never received my matcha latte after asking and reminding waiters more than eight times; 8!!! It got to be comical; which is why we counted.  By the end of our breakfast they finally offered it to me in it as a to go drink and still had the audacity to charge me for it; so I said no.  Second visit; was dinner with friends; this was a much more pleasant experience; there was four of us; we shared a bottle of wine and I remember I liked my food. No complaints here. Third time; was another breakfast round... I'm not sure what it is about breakfast but I don't think they do a good job for breakfast. To start with; we were given menus for both breakfast and lunch; which was appreciated; but no drink menus and we were specifically interested in mimosas or Bloody Mary's etc. because we didn't know what to order; or what was our options were... my dad ordered a Bloody Mary; and I ordered a Mimosa. I only mention this because it was frustrating to see other people have different variations of mimosas and also bloody mary's; other breakfast cocktails which we didn't even know existed.  My dad ordered a ham and cheese omelette with his side of home fries. I ordered the power bowl muesli.  We got through two drinks before the food came; which actually was a long time. By the time our food came; the order was wrong - my dad had fruit; but no home fries as he requested.  We immediately let our server know; and she said she would go grab them.  Additionally; our plates were extremely bland.  Just an omelette; no garnish or sides at all (other than the fruit in the side bowl.  The plates just looked sad.  Also; I could tell by looking at the omelette it wasn't good; that's how bad it was; and my dad concurred.  The wait staff failed to bring his home fries in any kind of fast or quick manner; so we reminded our bartender; who then reminded to server; once my dad got a refill on his coffee we also then reminded that server as well.  We ate through the entire meal; never got the home fries; and in the end right as our check was being delivered we mentioned the homefries again; and that's when the bartender sent a server running for them; and as we were signing our check is when they came out and were offered as a ""to go"" option.  While a simple side; it was really disappointing to go the entire breakfast with an awkward feeling of  ""I guess they just don't care"" and instead of comping anything; the manager offered me a $15 off coupon the next time we came in.  It's just hard to ever want to come in again... and didn't feel like an adequate apology on a $45 breakfast.  And lastly my dads omelette tasted like McDonalds.  Only upside was that my muesli power bowl was delicious; just hard to believe it took as long as it did to come out or that anything cost as much as it did with as horrible of service and lack of ""care"" put behind anything that was done there. [REVIEW_3] So we walk in and the receptionist Vann was   absolutely incompetent at his job;  we simply asked if there was any vacancy to which he replied with out any computer or paperwork check ""NO""  so we walk out and do a online search and booked a room to that same hotel!  We Came back confronted him about it to which he replied ""he didn't know anything about it""   Well Van if you don't know the only thing you are being paid to do; I suggest a you find a new profession. [REVIEW_4] There is nothing like the other pics showed!!! I never give out review on Yelp; but I had to comment on this restaurant! I am a sushi lover; the fish was poorly cut and the sushi rice is tasteless. The dynamite we had was extremely salty and loads of mayos. I took one bite left the rest on the table. This is the worst experience l've ever had in a 4.5 star restaurant; please avoid at all cost!!! [REVIEW_5] Went there yesterday the combo was almost 10.00 the burger was burned to a crisp;fries and drink were good when I told the cashier she said they all look like that baby so I threw everything including their little red basket in the trash.There was a couple of employees off the clock sitting in the restaurant cursing and laughing so loud that a few couples got up and left.No management or customer service skills in that entire place!Save your money and go and buy some fresh ground meat and make a real burger!",0
49,"[REVIEW_1] It just wasn't fun; or informative; or interesting; and the water portion-which is the thing that makes it different from other tours-is like 7min. and super boring. The guide wasn't great either; but for us at least they gave out the quakers at the end of the tour; being on the boat for 90 seconds with those things made the tour seem hours longer. There must be a better way to spend your money. I've been on duck tours in other cities and this one is the worst. [REVIEW_2] Local to St. Pete and finally visited for the first time tonight - we will not be back.  We started wondering if Ted Peter's is associated with that place Dicks Last Resort where the staff is intentionally miserable.  While there was one server who was friendly (taller blond with a braided ponytail); the rest of the staff were simply unhappy people.  The majority of the time we were there they moped around behind the counter like zombies where a TV was on with the news.  Smiles were met with grumpy faces; waves from a smiling 17 month old were met with a obvious turn the other way; questions were met with short and unpleasant answers - it was depressing to say the least.  To say it nicely; the staff all need some hugs- as someone previously mentioned about Carl (again except for the blond with braided ponytail; she was pleasant). If you are looking to bring out of town guests to Ted Peter's; I don't recommend it. If the experience was like ours tonight; your guests will certainly leave with the wrong impression of the people of St. Pete. [REVIEW_3] Would not recommend; the customer service is awful. Went for Sunday lunch only about 8 customers in the building; Took 15 minutes before they got our drink order. Ordered iced tea but they must've had a shortage of ice; the tea was cold but only few pieces of ice.  Once we got drinks we placed appetizer and food order. Took only 55 minutes for our appetizer and food to show up at the same time. Only to find hair in the food. I made comment to employee about taking so long to for food and they replied ""well we only have two cooks"" then she waked away. Like its my problem that the appetizer and food took so long. While I sat and waited I started noticing how careless and rude the staff was yelling back and forth across kitchen; cooks yelling to employees that were sitting down eating at kitchen area. feminine male playing around thrusting his hips as if he was having sex with someone. I threw up in my mouth and lost my appetite at this point. I figured it was just a bad batch of employees until I walked outside and look back at the building and seen all the torn up American flags. The owner and management obviously just don't have respect for anything or anybody. [REVIEW_4] There is a banner on the website that says ""free shipping over $50"". This company hates honoring this promotion and it's always a a hassle to get the free shipping and they conveniently have the shopping cart set up to always charge the shipping fee even if your order total qualifies for the free shipping. Anyway; my order total came to $160 but I was still charged shipping at checkout. So I called cust svc and spoke to an idiot beyotch that was hostile and completely mathematically challenged and illogical; as her defense was that since I used a coupon on my order; I should be okay with paying the shipping fee. Huh?! When that excuse didn't work; she then said I wasn't charged shipping for the conditioner (I had 4  items on my order). Umm; that makes no sense; as I'm still paying shipping on the other items (that are packaged in the same box as the ""freely shipped"" conditioner); plus the  shipping fee is a flate rate; so what good is it if one item out of 4 is shipped free?!  I have spent hundreds of dollars w/ this company but will never ever shop here again. My advice to all consumers is to bankrupt companies that don't appreciate your business. [REVIEW_5] Such a disappointment. I was expecting this to be one of the best burgers I've ever had (as I've heard) and some of the best fries; and I was completely underwhelmed. I ordered a burger with truffle mushrooms and a fried egg- cooked medium. The burger was completely over-cooked; way too salty; crumbling on my plate; and I couldn't drown it in enough ketchup to make it taste good. The fries were soggy and cold. My stepmother ordered the chicken sandwich and the chicken was so dry! Shake shack is WAY better. Sad. A for presentation; F for execution. Sorry but; if you're known for burgers and fries you should have a chef who knows how to execute.",0
50,"[REVIEW_1] Do not order the burgers! The menu laughingly states that they have the best burgers in town: not even close. Burger King has more flavor than these clearly frozen; stale tasting; poorly cooked pucks. Also; you could tell that the appetizers; while properly hot; were food service grade; pre-cooked; frozen concoctions that they then reheated. I cannot speak to other menu items; but I'm not going to waste any more money here. There is no excuse for not serving fresh food. [REVIEW_2] You will wait at least over 30 minutes in the drive thru! Go to ANY other Taco Bell and you wont! I have tried several times through the years and it never fails! They don't care about how long you wait! Wasn't even offered a apology for the wait! I asked why in the world is always so long of a wait here? Brooke just shrugged her shoulders and said;"" we are just short handed.."" which seems to always be the case! I wish they would just shut it down! Worse service ever! Laughing and flirting with other employees at the window! Never ever go here again! [REVIEW_3] I applaud Gaylord Entertainment for trying to tie a restaurant in with the Opry; its a shame the food doesn't measure up with the Opry. I just had my one and only meal at the Backstage Grill.  I tried their Southern Buttermilk Fried Chicken and instead of corn and potatoes I had Coleslaw and Mac N Cheese. They claim their chicken is Iron Skillet fired; maybe it is; but it sure is cooked in advance; From the time my server took my order until it was delivered to my table wasn't more than 10 minutes; no way their cooking Laminate; their attempting to hold it and serve as the orders come in. The Coleslaw had a bitter note with a heavy hand on the celery seed. The Mac N Cheese was luke warm less than 100 degrees and wasn't a very complimentary blend of cheese's; it tasted strange. The chicken was luke warm; at best it was 100 degrees which spells their going to make someone sick holding food in the danger zone.  I mentioned the food issues to my server who took the plate away with an apology. He returned once again with a freshly plated meal and told me to be careful the plate was hot.   Once again the Mac N Cheese was not any warmer than the 1st plate and the chicken was just maybe a tad warmer; not piping hot as it should be. What little chicken I did eat had a off putting flavor and texture. The coating was both grainy on the palette and lacked any seasoning what so ever. I visit Nashville every year so I do  frequent good eating establishments; sad to say this is not one I will return to since I'm not interested in playing Culinary Russian Roulette. [REVIEW_4] Never coming back. This is the second we've given then. Tonight; they charged us an extra $5; but was easily correct; not a huge deal. Second; the onion rings tasted like vanilla! We ordered a brownie cookie dough blast and got a cookie dough shake instead; the difference of about a dollar. My shake was missing the middle portion(see photo). The only good thing about this trip was the mozzarella sticks. 2 shakes and 2 sides for $15; no thanks. [REVIEW_5] Horrible food; undercooked sushi rice; pretty much bad everything. Don't waste your time or money",0
51,[REVIEW_1] Once again as of Friday it seems as though Wholefoods is moving away from organic and non gmo labeled products!  This transition is moving Sooo slow! Wholefoods market share will no doubt decline!  Also they always out of stock of store brand organic chicken breast [REVIEW_2] My husband and I ate here today. It was so good. It wasn't our original plan to stop there but the business across the street was out of oysters. ( oyster house?) So; we decided to go to Landry's. Wonderful and friendly staff. The food was amazing. The oysters we had were spot on what we wanted. It was our last stop before heading out of town. I forgot our waitresses name but she was great. Very friendly.  We also got the bananas fosters cake. For $13 it's a huge piece. And so good!  Thanks Landry's we will be back. [REVIEW_3] I was very disappointed with the cake I ordered. I picked it up at the shop. The service was very slow and I paid for the cake before I picked it up. I sat there for 10-15 minutes just for someone to wrap a bow around the already boxed cake. I ordered the White and Black Cake. The icing was not sweet at all and it was greasy. The cake was heavy and did not have much of a flavor. The cake was certainly not worth $70. [REVIEW_4] This place is a joke. Never going there again. No concept of customer service at all. Food is mediocre at best. [REVIEW_5] I usually stay away from restaurants on piers since most are tourist traps but went to this one since it had so many good reviews. Calm chowder had good pieces of clam but the soup was pretty thick - it is ok; not as good as some reviews here claim.  Crab cakes were also ok.  The shrimp and scallops pasta was awful - small shrimps and scallops; definitely not fresh.  It was also sour; either from some wrong ingredient or some overdue sauce.,1
52,[REVIEW_1] My bridesmaids booked this for my bachelorette party and it was so much fun!! We made really good friends with the other groups in our tour; played trivia; learned about Nashville's history; and got a little buzzed! Dave was an awesome tour guide; he's quirky and knowledgable and really opens up if you joke around with him :) plus he have me a bride cowboy hat with a veil and temporary tattoos for all of us which was a fun twist! Definitely a unique spin on day drinking! [REVIEW_2] Love this place!  Stopped in for a drink and a snack on Valentine's Day.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  We sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender a bit.  Loved the decor and the fact they only show 80s movies on their TV.  We had beef fat fries - life changing - so good! Overall great experience! [REVIEW_3] Food is great. Got food poisoning. Sooooo not going Back there ever. Check out koizi in Tampa [REVIEW_4] Foreword: My experience with the Bottleworks is as an event venue.  Every year; when the WUSTL department I'm in is trying to recruit new graduate students; we hold a social event here for the prospective and current students to mingle and get to know each other better.  The two years I've taken part in this event have just been a blast.  The Schlafly event room in the back-- I forget the name of it; but I think it has one-- is just a fun and unique place to have a private event.  The view of the Bottleworks is impressive; and the huge private bar set up on the side is just great.  I think the cost is pretty reasonable for us; too; which includes unlimited beer/wine per head along with a bunch of delicious hors d'oeuvre.  I'm a member of the group that helps put the event on this year; and I definitely think we're sticking with the Bottleworks again.  Look forward to an updated review around February or March next year! [REVIEW_5] Been here twice for sushi. Servers are fantastic- knowledgeable; patient; and not pushy,4
53,"[REVIEW_1] Great food!  Service was super nice: George!  Crab cakes were awesome.  Just a great place to eat! [REVIEW_2] If you want a hamburger or steak this isn't your joint.  So going to Pita Jungle was not my choice but my soon to be in-law's choice.  The patio is great to sit outside when it gets cooler out; it's laid back atmosphere is very much vegan- tree hugger.  I guess If you like veggies and healthy stuff this is your place to go. Personally me I'm a meat and potato type of gal who isn't your typical ""I'll order a salad and water""   The prices are very reasonable and from what others ordered it appeared the deep friend cauliflower was amazing. [REVIEW_3] I had a cheesesteak on the gluten free bread and a strawberry milkshake.  The gluten free hoagie bread was really good texture.  Not crumbly like a lot of gluten free breads and it didn't break apart at the seam.  Also the shake was delicious and I loved the decor.  I would eat here again if I lived in Philadelphia. [REVIEW_4] If you go to New Orleans this place is a must enjoy great music really cool atmosphere and when you notice that is nothing electronic in there is definitely a mind blowing feeling like a time machine [REVIEW_5] Went there for brunch today. Unfortunately; the person assigned to the omelet station had no idea how to cook AND she was sooooooo slow.  She overcooked every omelet and could not handle a two burner station.",3
54,"[REVIEW_1] St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 is the oldest and most famous of the three.   This is a must see on a visit to the Crescent City! I would also recommend signing up for a walking tour to fully appreciate what you are looking at.   Notable sites to see include: renowned Voodoo priestess Marie Laveau; Homer Plessy; (of 1896's Plessy v. Ferguson); and Nicolas Cage's pyramid shaped tomb (he will reportedly be buried here).  They are in the process of revamping some of the graves; but it would help if tourists stopped defacing the property. Leave your respects; leave a token of your appreciation if you will; but don't touch and don't take anything away with you except pictures.  You would think that this is common courtesy; but from what I witnessed this is not the case. OK; fine; I'll get off my soapbox now; thanks for listening! :) [REVIEW_2] Really really good.  I had the vegetarian spring rolls and chicken pho. The broth was incredible. Awesome fast and friendly service! Highly recommend! [REVIEW_3] Have been here many times and always had a great experience. When we moved to Rita Ranch 6 months ago my husband and I did a lot of rehab work on our new house and would go almost once a week to recover from the week's ""work-out"". It's always clean; they never gyp you on time; take the time to work on problem areas. Felicia is the best. Highly recommend them! [REVIEW_4] horrible food! waited for my nachos that took forever!!!! when they came they were freezing cold even the chips highly disappointed wish i could've given them  no stars they do not deserve any of my stars [REVIEW_5] We came here as a recommendation from a friend who lived in NOLA. This was by far one of the best places we stopped during our trip. The Iced Vanilla Latte was sooooooo good! Also; the Chicken Salad was by far the best salad I have EVER had! Luckily we stopped here on our way out of New Orleans so I bought an extra one for the trip home-- that's how good it is! My husband got a chocolate donut and breakfast taco and thought they both were super delicious. We also bought a king cake to take home since we heard such good things about theirs. Whenever we come back to NOLA this will be one of our first stops. It's my new favorite coffee joint! Please think about expanding and opening up one in Houston; Tx!",4
55,"[REVIEW_1] I see Dr Welch had have for nearly 4 years. I love him! He is old school and not into all the fancy crap some of these new Dr's are into. He is patient and very calming. I've had multiple issues with my body and he always seems to get me through! The staff is great and the office is clean! Highly recommend! [REVIEW_2] Expected better with all the hype. Tastes like bland day old pizza with a rubber crust. And I watched them make it. Perhaps this ""under new management"" thing has something to do with it? [REVIEW_3] Smoke and Barrel BBQ; less than marginal at best; I don't think I will ever come again! They should have kept Pastavino. Tri tip was roasted not smoked or BBQ'd cut into one inch squares; bread was hard. The chicken was the only thing somewhat worth eating. [REVIEW_4] My husband picked up 2 acai bowls for me and our 2 year old son at the West Nashville location. My bowl was great; but I'm thankful my son did not eat his. I ate his bowl for breakfast the following morning and it had 3 huge pieces of plastic in it! It was disgusting and very dangerous if my son had eaten that. I contacted The Urban Juicer to tell about our experience. Their head of HR emailed me back within 24 hours apologizing; saying she already contacted the store to ensure it wouldn't happen again; and said the CEO would issue me a refund and a $10 gift certificate. It's been over a week and I have not received a refund or gift certificate. I sent a follow-up email this morning; but still have yet to hear back. I'm bummed about this entire experience because I loved Urban Juicer...but this experience was disgusting; dangerous; and handled poorly by management. [REVIEW_5] Here's an update for my further Comcast experience. Our bill was increased to 250.00 a month. We called and removed some luxery items which brought our bill to 225.00 a month. Called 4 time a to see how we could get our bill lowered; as we have been a loyal customer for 14 years. ""Nothing we can do"" was all I heard. We decided to no longer be raped by this company and set up service with Verizon. Called Comcast to cancel once we got hooked up with Verizon. All of a sudden; they can do better and reduce my bill to 140.00 a month....which I would have been extremely happy with. Unfortunately; it should have been offered the four previous times I called.  I have Verizon now and have been quite happy with the installation; customer service; and overall product.  I wish Comcast would go under because they don't care about quality customer service. They could offer me a years free of service; yet I wouldn't take it on principle. Screw you Comcast!",1
56,"[REVIEW_1] I don't know if you can see it from the pic I uploaded but there's sauce covered straws; hair; crumbs and red soda all over the table they sat us at. I asked the waitress to clean it up. She wouldn't. We left before getting our food. Super gross. [REVIEW_2] I'm not sure why I'm writing this since you can just look at every other review written for this place and get the exact same story.   My wife was literally grabbed; like actually literally grabbed; by the face the second she stepped in the door. The culprit was a big-tittied shot girl that proceeded to dump a bunch of piss water down her throat. Then I was informed I owed her $24. When I refused to pay I was told the police were being called. My wife; not wanting to spend our trip coming to pick me up at the police station; (which is where I gladly would have gone rather than give a penny to these shady-ass MFers); swiped my wallet from my pocket and paid the bill.   Everybody there from the door guys to the managers to the bathroom attendants are the worst; most sketchy people on Bourbon Street. If you gave this place a five-star review please do humanity a favor and shoot yourself in the face. [REVIEW_3] NO WAY I know others like this place ;I'm sorry to say it was awful. The soup was ok; not filled up; looked like they didn't want to splurge with filling up to look decent.  the salad looked like they opened a bag of salad  dribbled it on then grabbed some off.  the garlic bread is full of jared garlic and oil  will make your stomach sick. my son ordered lasagna ; who knows what was in it  and i ordered pasta w/ broccoli it tasted like it was sitting in salt water and that was only flavor. when they found out i didn't like it the owner or someone; picked up my plate and with his fingers grabbed the spaghetti  and put it in his mouth ; need I say more how disgusting . Over priced and was awful. [REVIEW_4] I had high hopes for this place since the parking lot was full. I ordered fish and chips; and got peas and macaroni and cheese on the side. My companion ordered the knackwurst and saurerkraut with mashed potatoes on the side. The main courses were all right. The macaroni and cheese was inedible for me. The flavoring tasted very artificial. My companion's mashed potatoes tasted like paper. We have eaten at enough establishments like this to know we can get better quality food for more affordable prices. We will not be returning. [REVIEW_5] I typically only write reviews for excellent service and like to say I try to see the best in people. However our experience at shelter compelled me to share my experience.  We reserved an hour for bowling to celebrate a birthday.  By the time the hour was up; we had 4 people yet to finish their 10th frame.  This was perfectly fine. I walked over and asked for a 5 minute extension even offering more money for the courteous extension to finish our round.  I was then directed to the bartender who said he would do this; great!  While we waited for our match to come back online; someone came over and told my me and my fiancee to get off our seats because another group was coming. Of course we don't mind moving and sharing space once the other group gets there but there was aggression in his tone.  I assumed this man was just a sour person from the next group; but I later discovered he was actually the owner rudely telling us to move our rear ends.  After several minutes our scores disappeared; and I went to check in on the extra time still thinking this should be a simple fix and in good spirits.  I was told by the person I originally asked that he was too busy and that I should have talked to him when it first happened (this is the same person I initially talked to who redirected me to the bartended) because our scores are gone. He then redirected me to the owner who irritably said you're scores are gone; you can buy another hour if you want.  After I began to become upset; he backtracked and then offered 5 minutes but our scores  were still gone and his tone was still ""get out of my face; I don't care""  I understand mistakes happen and that's not the reason for my negative review.  Customer service was non existent. My entire party felt like a nuisance and not a customer.  The owner should be the pinnacle for customer service; but I have little doubt he is a reason that shelter has a limited lifespan.  It's a shame because it is a beautiful bar.",0
57,"[REVIEW_1] OMG 2 PLUS hours after a b-ball game waiting for our order TONS of people after us have eaten and left and they lost our order and said ""Oh well we  don't have your order you have already  paid for; we have others ahead of you "". WTF NOOOOO we had our order placed first it's not our fault you lost it hours ago so make OURS!!!!!!! (They didn't. ).  They came at least an HOUR AFTER us.  Forget  this place.  The WORST service  I will NEVER come back and will highly NOT suggest this place.   The food came 3 hours later and the onion rings were cold (how could that be ?. Ribeye sandwich didn't taste great and was not worth 10.00   POOR SERVICE; food isn't great; dirty smelly restrooms & I had to clean our table no YUCK!!!!! DO NOT come here!!!! [REVIEW_2] Two days here at the Eldorado with a group of 25 people. We have experienced the worse customer service . We just finished brunch and we're constantly badgered by our waitress about the number of people in our group. We were taking up too much space. She was a nice as a rattlesnake.  At 17 dollars per person I would think more is better. Food was ok but you will definitely not be welcomed or appreciated.   Yesterday same warm fuzzy feeling at the coffee shop when we spent over 350 dollars and we're treated like castaways.  TAKE YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE. .. NO HOSPITALITY AT ELDORADO [REVIEW_3] Fair warning; this is gonna be a long one; involving multiple locations and Southwest's ""Customer Service"".    I was heading out this past Thursday to make my cousin's HS graduation in east TX.  My first warning this would be the trip from hell was a text warning me of a delay in Tucson (TUS).  I live an hour & a half east of TUS; but decided to leave the house as originally planned to ensure I could speak to a gate agent.    My layover was to be 45 minutes in Denver; yet the delay was already 55 minutes due to weather according to the SW gate agent in TUS.  I was quickly informed I wouldn't make my Denver (DEN) departure.  What ensued was a crazy spider web of options having me fly to LAX; staying overnight in DEN; flying to Houston; then Dallas Love Field (DAL); my final destination...arriving at 5:45pm; with a 7pm graduation to make two hours away.  No Go!  Finally the gate agent said; ""Can you drive to Phoenix?...there's a flight leaving at 7:40pm.""  Realizing I had a nearly two hour drive; she quickly changed my flight & I hauled butt off-site to pick up my car & drive to PHX.   During the drive I realized the gate agent hadn't rescheduled my return flight & my car would be parked in PHX.  I quickly parked at the closest lot so I could speak to a gate agent; the parking later costing me $75 for a three day stay.  I stood for 45 minutes while the poor gate agent; Nancy; tried every way she could to reschedule my return flight so I could reunite with my car.  The system repeatedly gave her error messages & she couldn't even check in a stroller for two dazed parents.  All her calls to her supervisor yielded no physical response.  Nancy did her best; calling everyone she could & finally informed me ""for future reference; ensure the original agent changes your return flight too.""  A tad too late in this instance & I just had to board the plane; resorting to a Facebook post that yielded a possible ride from TUS to get my car in PHX; something I didn't want to use.  Nancy entered some notes & told me to call the 1-800-I-FLY-SWA customer service number to reschedule once in Texas.   Sadly; this was the tip of the iceberg.    The flight; pilots & flight attendants were wonderful.  I arrived 55 minutes later than my original flight; thankful the rental car company was still available.  What was terrible was the website & lack of customer service at FLY SWA.   Over two days I called eight times; spending a total of 4 hours; 18 minutes & 49 seconds desperately trying to get a human on the line.  As a tip - SW get some decent Muzak!  I stayed up til 4am freaking out because no one would respond; despite two messages saying I would get a call back in 15 minutes and 7 minutes; respectively.  I made two Facebook posts; even messaging them; with FB communications rep Lindsey no help.  During one hour+ session on hold I did a Google search & discovered that SW's website had gone into ""meltdown"" & their phone lines were overwhelmed due to their recent low fare sale.  Sure enough; I checked the website; & was booted off repeatedly.  I was in full-on panic now because it showed I had no upcoming flights; listing my departure was on my original TUS flight; with my return the rescheduled flight out of PHX - stupid considering this would've meant that I was in the air at the same time on two separate flights!  It was a very sleepless night imagining I was going to have to book another very expensive; short-notice; flight just to get back to my car.   Finally my cousin said ""to hell with SW; let's go to Walmart & buy some wine!""  Once again; I was on the phone; on hold buying a kiddie pool & booze when an angel named Rhonda finally answered.  24 minutes later I finally had a direct return flight to PHX; with a three hour drive home when I returned.  I have always loved the flight crews & agents at SW.  I love that they give snacks on the plane & their in-flight cocktails are reasonably priced.  But this was a very stressful ""adventure"" I don't ever want to repeat.  After all was said & done; Rhonda informed me I somehow have a miraculous credit of $133 I must use in the next two months.  I am searching for a brave soul to purchase the ticket for since I really don't want to fly SW ever again.  Sadly; SW is typically more expensive than other carriers; particularly since I rarely need to check a bag; & if I do; it's always free since I'm in the military. In addition; there's no assigned seating for the extra cost.  (As a comedian once said ""Ever fly Southwest?...One thru Forty...GO!!!"")  I might also add that most other carriers will let military pre-board; while Southwest does not.    I sincerely hope my experience this past weekend was a rare one & dedicated flyers fare better than I. [REVIEW_4] Went there for brunch today. Unfortunately; the person assigned to the omelet station had no idea how to cook AND she was sooooooo slow.  She overcooked every omelet and could not handle a two burner station. [REVIEW_5] This was so disappointing. I love Chick fil A. My son even works at the Avon location; which is fabulous. This is not the same. I tried to order my usual; that I get several times a week in Avon; and they received to accommodate. I only wanted the bread from the mini rolls. Go to Avon; very close and such a wonderful place to eat.",0
58,[REVIEW_1] My absolute favorite coffee place in Reno! Love everything here; including their mochas; lavender lattes; food (there's an AMAZING bread pudding). Great atmosphere where you can hang out with friends or study. Also love the Coffeebar in Truckee! [REVIEW_2] We had so much fun at this place! Lisa; Erika and and Sean  were phenomenal bartenders and really made our Saturday night the best. We will be bringing all our friends here to watch eagles games. Very friendly and makes you feel like home! [REVIEW_3] All I have to say is NANCY! She is the best waitress I've ever had. My friend and I love Cracker Barrel and it is always such a treat to go in and see Nancy's welcoming smile! She is attentive; funny and excellent at making great food suggestions. Go there and great service and great food!! [REVIEW_4] Went for Taco Tuesday. They were also having an event; and having just opened; I was a little worried. However; everything was great; the servers tried their hardest to make us happy.  PS: this is more Texmex style; not authentic. Keep that in mind. [REVIEW_5] The next morning we were up early; filled with expectations of the new adventures in New Orleans. We decided to walk to have breakfast in Surrey; which we found on Yelp. It was a highly recommended local breakfast place. Located far from the touristy French quarters; it's a small shack-dive beloved by locals and tourists as the best in local cuisine. Even before we got there; we saw a crowd of people waiting outside. The wait for a table was 30 minutes so we felt lucky and elated to sit at the bar. We got a watermelon and jicama salad and a crabmeat omelet. I was disappointment from the first bite. The omelet was soooo rich; like it was made with cream and butter and more butter-cream on top; it made me nauseous. The salad was so plain; it felt like a joke; a few pieces of watermelon on ripped up leaves of bibb lettuce  covered with black pepper. I needed to eat something and asked for a garden salad with a poached egg. It was a poor showing with some mixed greens; a pathetically thin slice of tomato; a few cubes of huge cucumbers used for juicing and a balsamic vinaigrette mixed by finger right in front of me. The place is a tiny shack; should be filled with lovingly prepared local cuisine. It is NOT. The food; as well as the service and the ambiance are a poor showing; more hype than substance. The supposedly organic fresh juices; at $7 a pop; are not squeezed to order but poured from containers from the fridge. Freshly squeezed should be freshly squeezed. They refused to give us water with ice. How can you not give people water when its so unbearable hot outside? We paid more for our breakfast than a top French restaurant in New York and I walked away hungry and disgusted.,4
59,"[REVIEW_1] This place is atrocious. The food made me sick. My boyfriend and I got the sushi for two and nothing was fresh. At all. The service was even worse. The guy refused to split our check. So bad; we went to chick-fil-a after. Overall; do not come here unless you want to live in the bathroom for the night. [REVIEW_2] My order has been either incorrect; overcharged; or cold each and every time I have come. If you are fine sacrificing quality of food and service for a cheaper price though; this could be the place for you. Just don't speak up about a mistake if you fear the staff and/or manager will give you attitude; because it may happen. [REVIEW_3] Please; this place makes a semi-new menu and raised their prices. The food is very mediocre. i just started cooking and i make a couple pasta dishes which include spaghetti and lemon chicken piccatta.  As a beginner in cooking I can judge this place's food is horrible. A day after the food looked like it had been out for weeks. Good food can last for a day or two.When i went in there to eat the hostess was nice. first; we ordered a glass a wine. he poured the wine; missed the glass and some spilled on the table and he just ignored it. hello. idiot. waitressing 101. go back. well needless to say. not worth your money at all. ive been there during happy hour with girlfriends and its fine. not a 'high end' restaurant by any means even though they try to make it that way. [REVIEW_4] Overall good experience from the from the front desk; to the tech who evaluated our dog and finally to the veterinarian who gave our dog the nose to tail exam. I highly recommend this place to anyone who needs veterinarian care. [REVIEW_5] Yelp doesn't allow to leave 0 star review; so that is why you see one star. Me and my wife are moving from NY to South California; and we contacted 5 different moving companies. I sent my initial email to United Van Lines on 05/02/2018; and soon I got email back with Virtual Survey confirmation for 05/10. The lady that did virtual survey was very meticulous and professional and we ""screened"" through the whole apartment in 15 minutes. No one contacted me after that; so I sent a second email almost a month after; on 06/05 asking if everything is ok; and if I can get the quote. I don't need to mention that other 4 companies sent their quotes in less than 48 hours. Since no one replied til today; I called the direct phone and I left the message on the answering machine. No one called me back. I hope everything is ok; and that no one is hurt; because I don't see any other reasonable explanation why they are avoiding me. Very; very unprofessional.",1
60,"[REVIEW_1] Been to this location twice and will never go back again!!!!  First time was mediocre; the second time was so very disappointing it beggars belief. I ordered some ribs and had to send them back because one half was warm and the other half was refrigerator cold. They came back and one side was really hot and the other side was still cold; third time it was edible. The manager came over the third time to apologize; never once offered to comp anything. I'm not the kind of guy to cause a fuss to get something comped; but to send something back three times to get it cooked properly and only get an insincere apology really pisses me off; enough for me to write this review. [REVIEW_2] Went to Honey grow today (12-21-15) around 6 o'clock and needed two 10.00 gift cards. It took 3 people and 20minutes to ring me up for 2 freakin'gift cards. Ridiculous......... The attitudes of the evening workers is very dissatisfying and disappointing. They are there to serve and greet people as well as make good food. They did NO greeting and they looked like they had bad attitudes; 2 of them were playing around with a spoon that was probably soon going to be used to stir someones food. Ewwwwww. I will most likely NOT be entering this Honey Grow establishment again. [REVIEW_3] Stopped in here with my wife and a friend for lunch today. And let me tell you it will probably be the last time I visit this location.  I normally love QDOBA but this location down right sucks. From the ride ass customer service to the cleanliness it's just all around terrible. I've never had a person whistle at me from behind a ""line"" and say ""excuse me what would you like to eat"". You're kidding me right?  And plus look at my pics; this chick had her hair dangling down in front of her face and swaying back in forth and prepping food. ARE YOU SERIOUS? What happened to having it covered up? I won't be back to this location; to easy to get sick or catch something. [REVIEW_4] I was excited about the opening of this restaurant. The location is amazing and I felt it would help to welcome the cruise visitors as well as provide ""revitalization"" of the area. I don't know that they know anything about Mexican cuisine; but then again; the choice of name should have told me that. It might be an intent to be witty; but they know about mexican food as much as they speak a language that does not exist. Was the food Tex-Mex? no. Was it; maybe; a glorified franchise version of what a taco could be? close. The location is fabulous. Tons of potential there. The place itself is like a franchise is. Nothing peculiar or memorable. The music is loud and definitely not in Spanish. It is a try to compete with Hooters. Tons of very young and inexperienced servers who stood around the kitchen-dispensing counter that can be seen by all the patrons sitting around. All expressions of waiters and staff easily read. It is a new place; and we were instructed that most of the menu was not yet available. Quite limiting as of right now. We were given the standard chips and salsa of some restaurants. The chips were crisp and thin. Lovely; the actual problem was how to scoop up the guacamole and queso fundido we ordered with them. They crumbled and broke every time. We ended with a kind of tortilla soup/puree of sorts. The salsa was rather sweet. It tasted like marinara with some roasted chiles in it. Not spicy at all; and I ought to know because everything is spicy to me. The guacamole was definitely fresh. Want to know how I know? I had a whole avocado slice inside the green tasty mush. Needless to say; the thin tortillas presented a challenge. We cut it in pieces and used a knive to spread it on the tortillas as if they were crackers. Our order was brought to the table and about three minutes later; a confused waiter brought another for us (of the same we were eating) and was baffled as to what to do with the obvious mistake. She returned to the counter and the whole crowd of staff members seemed uncertain as to what to do with the extra queso fundido; refritos and guacamole. We ordered tacos! yes; they hablan taco! we got: cold flour tortillas; stiff upright and if you tried folding them into a burrito they broke. Sounds familiar? we have all bought ""la Banderita"" and eat them unheated at home. I wanted steak taco; but was told they had ran out of the meat (it was 5 o""clock on a Sunday) so I decided to go for chicken... it had ONE texture; As if it came from a can. It was also cold. the toppings and their runny juices of veggies cascaded to the plate. The same story happened with the beef tacos. Cold and runny. The hamburger (yes; they speak hamburguesas too) was charred but almost raw inside. And cold. The server asked us how our food was. I aswered with a cold: ""interesting..."" He never bothered to ask as to what I meant. There were not desserts or coffee offered. Apparently not a place to linger. Our server passed us by and we asked for the bill. He immediately took it out of his pocket and placed it on our table. He was psychic enough to somehow know we would not want anything else. Ever. [REVIEW_5] The service here is terrible. After a fill in my nail and the acrylic cracked in half there he used the blade. I called up there and the man who answered said they'll fix it. Once I got there they tried to charge me 10 to fix something that was their fault. Then the man at station 5 caught an attitude because I wouldn't let him pull my broken nail off that was still connected to my skin. He then told me he wasn't fixing my nail.",0
61,"[REVIEW_1] Wow; wow....just wow.  So after a year of dying to come here; I finally made it.  My girlfriend treated me for my birthday.  We made reservations for 2 at 6PM on a Wednesday night.  This place is BYOB so bring your wine!  The place is SUPER tiny; so be prepared for that.  This isn't your standard Italian place by any stretch.  There are only roughly 12 tables here; which I'm sure undoubtedly ensures the highest quality food coming out in a timely manner.  The wait staff were pretty darn good.  They worked more as a team as the 3 person squad were all constantly at our table either delivering food or checking up on how we were doing.  We never had to ask for more water and were helpful and choosing a perfect menu for us.  We decided to go with 2 orders of the antipasto and an order of the shrimp/beans appetizer.  The antipasto was AMAZING; almost everything on it was unique and flavorful.  My girlfriend was obsessed with the fresh arugula.  I loved the roasted red peppers; frittada and asparagus.  The shrimp were expertly cooked and seasoned and pretty much unlike any shrimp you get at a restaurant.  Well worth it in my opinion.  For our entree we decided to get 3 small portions of different pastas on the menu.  We went with the spinach gnocchi; tagliatelli al limone with the bottarga cheese and the pesto trapanese.  All were extremely unique.  I've never had spinach gnocchi quite like this and was such an awesome experience.  The tagliatelli was super fresh and the limone sauce was divine.  I loved the pesto dish and the crushed pistachio on top complimented the pesto so well.  They are also pretty liberal with their bread here; so order away!  The tomato pie focaccia was amazing.  The other bread was on par as well.  We ended our night with some zeppolies.  They were warm and fresh.  The nutella sauce was a great modern twist.  A perfect ending to a perfect meal.  The place can be a bit on the high side; but I think it's totally worth it.  This is coming from someone who would merely be happy with 2 for $20 at Chilis.  On an ending note; with the place being so super cramped it can get a wee bit loud.  The table next to us had about 6 people and were dominating the noise space of the entire dining area.  It was quite obnoxious; but it was tolerable...only because of the food!  Am I going back? Do you have to ask? [REVIEW_2] Ruined our Friday happiness.   Thought it would be nice to go to Friendly's for a family meal to start the weekend...but the moment we arrived; I knew we should have left.   Two employees at the front were talking to themselves; ignoring to greet us. When a 3rd employee asked his colleague where to seat us; she clearly wasn't eager to have us in her section; then she caught my eye as she then knew I heard her.   We were guided to our table -- right next to the kitchen entry...meanwhile 1/2 the place was empty; as we passed by booths with ""broken"" signs on them and other dirty; uncleared tables. I asked to be seated at another booth--so we then were seated 1 row over from the kitchen entry...   The initial ""Hi; I'm so-and-so"" was fine and we ordered our 3 meals and waited. Drinks arrived -- my glass of Coke was chipped and the other glass of Sprite tasted terrible; like seltzer. Asked for another Sprite and got the same terrible drink.   Later; I spotted our 3 meals on the warmer (remember; we are sitting 1 row away from the kitchen...) and ironically the warmer shelf is next to a clock. 6:02pm. Waited and waited...server finally walked by and I had to let her know that our meals were ready -- ""Let me check;"" she says.  6:04pm. She goes missing...then she brings 2 of the 3 plates to our table and disappears again. I had to waved down another server and asked for my plate; still sitting on the warmer. 6:06pm. That server goes missing. Our original server finally brings my plate. Burger with the wrong cheese...over-cooked waffle fries. (Or maybe fries were over-cooked and dry from sitting under the warmer for 5 minutes as I stared at it.) Turkey BLT was subpar and the kids chicken fingers were over-cooked too.   I'm surprised the server came by later and asked how our meals were (albeit robotic) but not surprised that when we said I got the wrong cheese; she said ""sorry"" without any suggestions or offers to make good on her mistake.   We were ready to pay and eager to leave...we waved down another server who said she couldn't take our payment as our assigned server had to do it. We said ""Can you let her know?"" and she said ""I can't; she's with another table"" and walked away. We were in disbelief that this experience just got worse.   The only good memorable moment was when I said under my breath ""This place is terrible;"" and my young son repeated me.   Advice: Hire people who are actually Friendly or shut it down. This is an embarrassment. Will never go there again and probably never go to another Friendly's ever. [REVIEW_3] Wow. I am not a vegetarian; nor am I a health-food nut (except for my random ""diet"" binges) but this place is awesome. A co-worker talked me into trying it out one day (by going there and getting me something and putting it in front of me) and she created a monster. I may not order every day but I sure do think about them. And their delicious salads! Every time I go there I am greeted with a smile and there are tons of other people waiting for their food; as well. Good company =) [REVIEW_4] Good place for a good breakfast and coffee.  Simple wholesome and good service what else can one ask for breakfast? If you are visiting New Orleans at the French quarter and looking for a good place to start your day; then that this is the place for you.  Recommended... [REVIEW_5] I was in the market for a car and went here to look. They didn't really have what I wanted; but my car salesman found one I might like about a week later. I decided to put $1;000 down to save the car so I could think about it. The salesman said that the money would be refunded in full if I decided I didn't want the car. I decided THAT DAY to NOT purchase the car and informed the salesman. The $1;000 had already been charged to my account and now it's taken over 2 WEEKS and my refund still hasn't gone through. This is a nightmare; I wish I had never given them my deposit. I feel SO stupid for trusting in them.    On top of that; the salesman was so over-the-top with his hyper energy; it made me anxious. He kept urging me to ""sign today; sign today."" He even went as far as to show up unannounced at my place of work. He had brought a car off the lot to show me. I felt so violated and uncomfortable.      They may have the car you are looking for but don't let them push you; don't give them your number and be CAREFUL with signing anything and giving them money.",3
62,[REVIEW_1] Love this place. My partner and I go all the time. The food ( thanks; in part; to James in the kitchen) is consistent and so good. My partner is addicted to the Rueben. I change around a lot but the burgers are fantastic. We prefer sitting at the bar and always get great service; we especially like Claire. Beautiful job on the decor. Bathrooms are always clean. This place is a great addition to the neighborhood and an asset to our community. [REVIEW_2] I can't believe I have to give a star.  Quick rundown.  I ordered: single with no ketchup; mayo; or mustard with med fried and large unsweetened teas double with everything lg fries large coke 2 5 piece nuggets side salad cheeseburger kids meal plain with oranges and vanilla frosty. Ok now for what I GOT: double with bacon; no ketchup mayo or mustard; lg fries; coke single with everything; lg fries coke hamburger kids meal with fries and coke right around the time I said no ketchup a blank look came across the face of the employee. This is not rocket science. [REVIEW_3] Such great customer service!! I was only there for a few minutes to get some food; but the workers were very very friendly and left a good impression on me! [REVIEW_4] Came here for breakfast for the first time a year ago.  Went here again last week.  Still very good!   Food is delicious; and the coffee (capuccinos; lattes; etc.) are outstanding.  Not too hot; not too bitter; and the milk is incorporated into the coffee just right.   Will definitely come back the next time we visit Santa Barbara. [REVIEW_5] This place has the worst customer service! We were the 2nd in line to sell clothing; and by the time they get to ours they don't even look the just start throwing things to the side without even looking at them... They are rude!!! Take your time to drive elsewhere!!! It's worth it to use the gas and pass this place,3
63,[REVIEW_1] I did a lot of research for fence businesses to compare quality; honesty; and professionalism. I chose Prince's Fences to install a privacy fence. Chuck; the owner; is easy to work with. He leaves his contact number and is very quick to return calls. I was impressed with Chuck and his team. Each one knowledgable; professional; and friendly. Give Prince's Fences consideration when you want consider fencing. I appreciate; too; that he answered all my questions concerning different options and why one fence might be better over another. Good job; Prince's Fences! Thank you. [REVIEW_2] This was a cool place to stop by and check out the birds on a Sunday morning.    My daughter and I have stopped in here a couple of times so she can look at the birds.  Very friendly staff.  If you're a bird person this is the place to go. [REVIEW_3] The last 2 times we took our dog here; our female dog got kennel cough.  Added vet bills over $100.  Never going back to this place again. [REVIEW_4] We have had a blast to each event we've been to.  We've been to concerts and basketball games and other were a lot of fun.  The food is really good; also.  A lot of local favorites are offered. [REVIEW_5] Favorite place in Nashville for breakfast!! This is a must go to spot!! Near Vandy and always busy...park in the back lot and be sure to get the parking ticket from the machine so you won't be charged...its free parking for a specified amount of time. My favorite is banana pancakes...think banana bread only in a pancake!! Perfection!!!! I don't leave Nashville until I go here to eat my pancakes!,4
64,[REVIEW_1] I remember being wheeled in the basket by my mother across this parking lot as a child 40+ years ago.  So happy that they are still around and better than ever.  Dorignacs has by far the best produce; meats and liquor selection and prices.  They also have hard to find items that you cannot find anywhere else. The bakery is amazing; the glazed donuts and canolis are the best.  They also have Turtles.  YUM!  They are upgrading the layout and have recently given it a facelift to keep it fresh looking.  I also like that when you are there almost every isle is staffed with a checkout person. [REVIEW_2] My friends and I went here one time for margaritas; and we sat outside. We were charged a $5 cover; and I have literally NEVER encountered as horrible service as I have at Copa. After we got drinks we didn't see the waitress again. We actually had to go inside to close our tab. [REVIEW_3] Jayna is a great asset when it comes to wedding dress hunting. After listening to my location and style of wedding she pulled amazing show-stopping dresses that I wouldn't originally think would work. She has a gift! She's honest and insightful but also let the members of my party really enjoy the process. She also regularly updates the dresses in her boutique. [REVIEW_4] best coffee shop in santa barbara great vegan snacks very nice and beautiful employees also good music [REVIEW_5] We tried to stop in and wait for a table for the second night in a row. The hostess was utterly useless. She refused to tell us how many tables were in front of us; rough estimate of how long it would be (other than a while); and wouldn't tell us how long a to go order would be. There were empty tables everywhere so I didn't understand why there was such a long wait.   Since we did eat there the night before and we were trying to go back; the food was good. Best cheesecake my fiancé ever had. My steak was cooked well and flavorful. My baked potato was cold when it came out. Bread was yummy. But the service sucks so bad; I wouldn't recommend it.,3
65,[REVIEW_1] This place should be on Restaurant Impossible. It's run down; the decor is tacky; beaten up; miss-matched and cheap. It's really dark...probably to hide how dingy it is. Everything was sticky. I ordered a burger medium and got a charred; tasteless hockey puck. My mom and aunt got the baked crab soup; which before we ordered; we misheard each other and called it baked crap soup. It turned out to be a better description. The crab stuffed mushrooms were heavy on the stuff and light on the crab.  The servers were super nice though. [REVIEW_2] Ok well I'd heard so much about this place i had to try it. Well NEVER AGAIN! Dirty Dirty Dirty! Rude service. Chicken parm outrageous over priced. N never in life had chicken parm covered in black pepper. Would of sent back if waiter ever came back to table. Bread was so old n when asked for new i was questioned if i new what i was talking about. Well since i grew up in the food industry. I think i know. N from dirty table clothes. Too dirty glasses not once but 2x give up on clean one. If it wasn't for husband stopping me complaining right then u would of heard it all in person. I know restaurant have off nights. But this was beyond OFF. [REVIEW_3] Why did it just take over 5 minutes for me to get only a medium coffee?  Because there wasn't any coffee made in a coffee establishment; that's why. In addition; there are non-customers sitting in all of the outdoor seats and the floors and counters are sticky. I'm done with this Cosi. I'll be going to Brew Ha Ha from now on. The customer service is just too poor here. [REVIEW_4] Service was...wait what service?! We were disregarded for 15 minutes after asking for service. While the quality and atmosphere may have been wonderful the service was an absolute disappointment. Save your money for those that appreciate your patronage. [REVIEW_5] I went in on a Sunday morning to pick up a few desserts for a family gathering at the Center City location..  I saw Baklava; and was told not to purchase them by the sales associate (and I appreciate her honesty) because they were hard as a rock..  I then purchased to cakes; a Pound cake; and a peanut butter mousse cake.  Everyone was looking forward to the peanut butter cake.  EVERYONE TOOK A BITE AND SPIT IT OUT!  IT WAS STALE.  The chocolate was ok; but the mousse has a horrible RANK taste; and SMELL as well.  It tasted and smelled  like spoiled cream cheese.  It wasn't one of those things that taste like something; IT WAS SPOILED.  Even the partial peanut butter cups on the top tasted stale!!!  The pound cake was ok; nothing special..  Needless to say; the experience of tasting spoiled food makes me never to return again!,0
66,"[REVIEW_1] Horrible Customer Service. I asked for a quote on my car from damages from the tornado. I thought he wrote everything down and he called me several times so that I can repeat the damages. The next day; I called to notify Vic that 2 of my small windows that I originally thought were broken are actually intact. I asked him could he adjust the quote and he told me to just subtract the price from the other windows. He was so frustrated that I requested the quote he hung up the phone or so he thought. He thought he hung up and proceeded to vent his frustrations about me loudly and rudely to whomever was in the shop. I stayed on the phone until he picked it up to express why I would not patronize his establishment. I understand that Vic is reasonable; but you get what you pay for and that's lack of respect and customer service by the owner! [REVIEW_2] My husband took me out to dinner at the Joe's crabshack on us31 on October 5th.  We went in and the hostess started to take us to a booth; and i told her asap that i need a table as I can't sit in a booth.  She paused; called someone & asked if they were still on breack (yes the waitress was); then said nothing and led us to a table.  Upon sitting down; she gave us 2 menus.  Mine had food all over it; so I put it aside and used my husbands.  We then sat for over 10 minutes NOT getting acknowledged; NOT being spoken too; and we knew we had been seated at a table where the person was on break.  After almost 15 minutes we decided to just walk out.  I went up to the manager and told him we were leaving and why.  He asked us to stay; said it was his fault; and said he would pay for our meal.  No thanks.  Not staying under those conditions.  We were disgusted with the staff there.  At one point while we were sitting there; we saw 5 waitresses all gathered around the register with the manager just talking.  I guess they figured we would sit there waiting on that waitress to come back off break.  We left; and went to the other Joe's on Dean Road.  Much better staff there; and a whole diff atmosphere.  I do NOT recommend this place at all.  They all need training; including the manager. [REVIEW_3] Went here for the great food I had experienced before.  After HORRIBLE service; flagging down the waitresses; & being told they were out of all drinks except alcohol & water; my friends and I left leaving cash at the table to cover our tabs but did not tip. The staff proceeded to call my boyfriend a nigger & follow my friend outside threatening to call the cops.  I was disappointed in the wait staff but their intolerance & bigotry will definitely prevent me from ever going back. [REVIEW_4] I really want to like this place; they have a really cool concept with interesting drinks; however the excitement stops there. But because of the service; and the environment the rude bartenders create; I will never go back. I went recently with a group of girls celebrating a bachelorette party. This was at the beginning of the night; none of us were drunk; we're all a little bit older; so we were very quiet and tame; as far as groups of girls go.   The bartenders were nothing but rude to all of us. I hate nothing more than an entitled bartender. You're in the service industry... in the quarter... Anyway; the bride to be wanted a picture at each bar she went to; and we asked the bartender in a nearly empty bar if he could either take a picture or be in the picture; and his responses were beyond rude.   Also; my friend asked for change for a $20; and the bartender completely forgot; and made her sit and wait for 15 minutes while he did other things. My friend just patiently waited. and when the bartender realized he forgot; he wasn't even apologetic.   Don't waste your money on this place; go to Latitude 29 where the bartenders are nice and accommodating; the drinks are better at Latitude anyway in my opinion. [REVIEW_5] Vault of Souls is a $50 cover charge to get into an over-priced bar.  The ""experience"" lasts for 20 minutes unlike the escape room.  You are rushed through and spoon-fed the answers in a pitch-black room. If you want to waste your money and buy crappy drinks; be my guest. I say SKIP IT!",0
67,"[REVIEW_1] My fiancé and I went to Spraga last night..needless to say it was our first and last time dining at this establishment.  We were pretty pumped to go here since we live right down the street and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at Fat Ham a few weeks ago.  The food was good but not show stopping.  My major issues were with the service.  1 word.  Unbelievable.  We spent $180 on 2 people.  When you spend that much money on a meal.. You expect perfection with food; service and ambiance.  This place underwhelmed and now I have to deal with my fiancé who is still raging with last nights experience.  Thanks Spraga.  Issues: 1.  Soups came before cocktails.  I finally had to ask a manager where our cocktails we're because it so long.  - not in my world if I'm paying $180!   2.  First course came while we were still eating our soup..so we had 2 plates in front of us on a cramped table.  Hello serving 101 at like the most basic restaurant in the world..Don't bring the next course when people are still eating their first!  Again I would expect shit like this to happen if I were at TGI Fridays but I wasn't at TGI Fridays.  I was at SPRAGA. 4. The waiter tried to remove plates while we were still eating from them.  Say what?  Not when I'm paying $180 on a meal son!  You leave the plate until I am finished! 5.  The waiter would awkwardly come to the table and just stand there.. Obviously we know he came to take our food order or dessert order but you say "" Is everyone ready?.. I'd like to take your order"" etc.  WTF.  Nope he just stood there... Weird!   6.  Empty glasses/butter dishes left on the table throughout the meal.  Sloppy.  The server tries to take plates we are still eating from but leaves sangria glasses etc for the entire meal?  I just.  Don't.  Get it.    All in all food was good; not amazing and I've had better service at Tangier.  If you are going to spend that much money go somewhere else. [REVIEW_2] I have taken my small pomimo here 4 times and before I hadn't had any complaints. I had set up an appointment on Thursday which I had walked to and the power was out but they still told me to keep my dog there. 30 mins after being home I get a call saying they can't do it and that we need to reschedule. I rescheduled for Saturday morning; two hours they call me tell me to come get him. I paid 60$ and his haircut is literally a hack job; i could of done something similar with my boyfriends trimmers! I called to inform them and they were not picking up my call.. What a waste of my Christmas money! [REVIEW_3] After reading these reviews; being a patron several times over the past 3 years; and now having the privilege to work for this company I have noticed several things.     I haven't had a bad experience with the service; or my food personally. my family on the other hand had a particularly bad experience 2 months ago. Basically bartender service took way too long; first beer was flat; replacement never came and he was charged anyway. Kitchen was backed up; server was absent and inattentive; resulting in a screaming baby; cranky mother; and frustrated customers.     That being said; this is NOT the restaurant I work at today. MILLER'S SPRINGFIELD has recently gotten a MAJOR makeover...under new general management  new assistant manager and new kitchen and service management along with MAJOR overhaul in front of house staffing; keeping only the most qualified of previous staff and maintaining rigorous training standards for new staff such as myself will continue to produce improved service; knowledgeable hard working staff; smaller margin of error; and higher customer satisfaction. This I know.    I have confidence in our team in particular; the support and structure we give each other. Only with a solid structure and support system can a workplace be free to have fun and express themselves. [REVIEW_4] Coming from California it's been hard finding authentic Mexican food but my search is over. This place is delicious  I live far from this place but it's worth the drive for sure. Everything on the menu is good! Plus the service was excellent  unfortunately I didn't take pictures because I was hungry and the food looked amazing lol next time [REVIEW_5] HUGE disappointment!  I am from Seattle and came down to Santa Barbara for New Year's Eve.  My girlfriends and I wanted to have a nice meal to bring in 2010. I thought I did my research--read reviews; got a recommendation from a local; and thought the online menu looked good.  When I called to make a reservation I had a lovely conversation with the owner--another confirmation that I had made the right choice.  Well; I couldn't have been more wrong.  My girlfriends and I got dressed up; made our way to the restaurant; and the second we walked in; I knew it was a mistake.  It was too cold to sit outside (which was beautiful); and so we went into the brightly lit indoor part of the restaurant; surveyed the scene and realized that we were the youngest people there by at least 40 years (and we are in our 30s).  The ""Latin jazz"" band was little more than forgettable background music; which did absolutely nothing to help the vibe.  There was no vibe.  The restaurant lacked energy; the wait staff were professional; but not personable; and the food was incredibly disappointing.  We knew we would be paying a lot (total 100.00 each) for a price fixe New Year's Eve dinner--and I have no problem spending that if the food is amazing; and the experience is unforgettable. As soon as we sat down we started to be served; the wait staff; highly attentive; perhaps because all of the food was already prepared in the back; not many people were there; and they wished they didn't have to work on New Year's Eve.  It was too much.  We got our drinks (mediocre mojitos) and immediately were served our appetizers; which made it hard to enjoy our drinks.  We could not languish over any of our dishes; but perhaps this was better; because the food was absolutely terrible.  I can only speak to what I ordered--it was the New Year's Eve price fixe; and apparently there was a guest chef that night; but I couldn't eat the majority of it.  The empanadas were OK; the soup was fine; I had a salad that had some kind of tangy dressing that I couldn't bear to put in my mouth.  The main dish I ordered was fish and it was served in tin foil.  I understand if it was cooked this way; but to serve it on a plate; with sides on the outside of the tin foil; made no sense to me.  In the end; it didn't even matter because the fish had absolutely no taste.  We ended up leaving before the clock struck 12:00--none on us wanted to start 2010 in a place that was bland; vibe-less; and forgettable.  I understand that this night may have been different from other nights; but it literally left a bad taste in my mouth and I will not return there nor recommend it to others.",2
68,"[REVIEW_1] This place has terrible customer service. I pulled up to the rails and 1 of the employees walked out and acted like I didn't stop. He started shaking his head and acting like I was an idiot. Hey. Your the idiot who waves people up to you and don't move out of the way. I'll never be back. Watch out. They are looking to sue somebody for their stupidity. [REVIEW_2] After an unsuccessful first experience with this pizza place; the owner contacted me and generously offered to deliver another pizza in the future; free of charge.  Tonight; I took him up on his kind offer.  We ordered the Pepper pie; which included Peppadews; Jalepenos; Poblano Peppers; Crumbled Hot Sausage; Mozzarella & Red Sauce.  We were not disappointed!  Not only was our order delivered in a very timely manner; but the pizza was fresh; hot; and smelled wonderful!  The pizza was full of flavor; with equal parts sweetness and spiciness.  The crust was also very tasty.  I can definitely say the ingredients were top-notch; as well.  I plan on being a Pizzicare customer in the future; as the business shows excellent customer service and takes pride in their product.  I highly recommend it! [REVIEW_3] Everything I had was amazing! We ordered brisket plate with corn bread; coleslaw; Mac and cheese and potato salad. I don't usually like potato salad but this was really good! Mac and cheese was good but could use some more spices. Brisket was tender and easy to eat. [REVIEW_4] It is a shame; since my kids love the jungle gym; that this place is such a dive.  It is dirty. Really dirty. And a lot of attractions are in pretty lousy shape.  The air conditioning is barely holding on. It is a super hot day; but c'mon; I shouldn't be sweating buckets just sitting and my kids are so hot we're headed out after being here a half hour :/  It is pretty cheap; but not worth it when the conditions are so rough that we can't stay and play. We were the only ones here on a weekday afternoon; I guess everyone else has already figured out what a dump it is.  Edited to add: I let the kids get a few tokens from the token machine on the way out. The machine spit out tokens that the games wouldn't take and management wouldn't give us new ones saying that those aren't jungle wonder tokens. (Even though I got them from the machine in jungle wonder.)   Never again. [REVIEW_5] I was shocked by my stay here.  I came for a wedding weekend and felt that I would have had a better experience at a a Holiday Inn Express down the street.  My hotel room left me feeling absolutely disgusted.  There was hair all over the bathroom; on towels and heaped on the floor.  The headboard had HUGE dust bunnies hanging off the front of it.  The next morning I go to breakfast and the service was clearly that of people motivated to get the back of the house or communal tasks done; but not actually to serve the people.  I was asked and ordered orange juice; only to have to ask a different server 10 minutes later.  This happened multiple times with different members of our group.  Then another table must have requested tabasco sauce; which we had on our table.  The server comes over between two of our members and takes it; there was no ""Are you using this?"" or even ""Excuse Me.""  They need to find a different way to motivate the staff because it did not meet basic service expectations.  Do not waste your money by staying at this hotel; you will only be disappointed and potentially disgusted.",2
69,"[REVIEW_1] Ok; I hate to give a place one star and I generally don't do it; but after two visits within the past week and both of them being poor; I am left no choice.  On the first visit; an individual in my party (of three people) received their order incorrectly and the kitchen manager was going to fix it.  I believe she then forgot to turn in the order to fix it so everyone was done and the lady still didn't have her corrected order.  Our waitress didn't even return to our table the entire time we were there.  We had to flag down another employee for drink refills.  Second visit... waited...waited...waited... seriously; how long does it take to make a few pizzas; a salad and an app?  Then; we ordered dessert; waited about ten minutes for it.  The employee said ""sorry for your wait"" when he brought us the check and then we continued to wait another ten minutes for him to come back and pick it up.  If you are going to acknowledge our wait; you might not want to make us wait again.  Grr!  We were late getting back to our office from our lunch break.  Probably have to say with certainty that I won't be returning to CPK.  Sorry; because the food is actually not that bad but the service could use serious improvements because they are not even that busy of a place! [REVIEW_2] Our service wasn't the greatest. They told us it takes 35-40 for a pizza and we were in a little bit of a rush so just ordered appetizers but those took 40 mins to get as well. [REVIEW_3] Great place to go for an inexpensive byte. They have a few locations throughout New Orleans; polite staff great quick service. They do have beer. Love their burgers and fries. Excellent seafood. Plenty of parking. [REVIEW_4] I typically love KFC but my opinion is changing based on increasing cost and poor service.  Was interested in trying their new Nashville flavor but was advised that it is only offered in strips; as a 2 piece with one side or a bucket. I wanted it in a 3 piece with two sides and was advised that that was not possible. I guess I won't be able to try it. [REVIEW_5] Had my phone inside a LIFEPROOF case and less than a week later; accidentally dropped it on a CARPETED floor and the screen shattered. Not so impressed anymore.  Oh; and it took a day or so to really notice; but their reinstallation include a slanted home button. (Is this related to the enormous shatter across the new screen; Apple people?)",1
70,"[REVIEW_1] They have a lot to learn about service. The male bartender was super apathetic and seemingly annoyed by our existence...ex: when taking our brunch order he just walked up and said ""Food?"" In general he couldn't be bothered to interact with us; let alone do it with any hospitality.   Lousy drinks --  the mimosas are a ripoff. We ordered a carafe; but it was 90% juice; only the neck was topped off w/ sparkling wine. We're not ordering juice here; people; we're ordering drinks! A mimosa should be mostly sparkling and topped w/ juice. I asked if he could add more but his adjustment made no difference. But here's the kicker -- when a friend of the apathetic bartender sat next to us; she was welcomed with smiles and jovial hospitality; and when she ordered a mimosa guess what she got? 90% sparkling wine; topped with juice! You know; the way they're supposed to be made.  Clearly there's no front-of-house manager to oversee and ensure good service.  Food-wise; it's meh. The forgettable $13 & $15 entrees didn't come with sides; so you gotta pay extra to have potatoes or grits or bacon w/ those eggs.  Sorry guys; but New Orleans is a food and hospitality town....You aren't even trying. I don't imagine Morrow's will be around unless you step up your game in a major way. (and writing yourself fake reviews wasn't the solution -- glad Yelp removed them!) [REVIEW_2] I really; truly hate giving bad reviews but I can't help it this time. Before I check a place out I refer to Yelp and boy did I get an eyeful when I read about the BROKEN BEAKER DISTILLERY. Vodka tasting like dirt? I wanted to give it a chance anyway. I never knew there was Dirt Flavored Vodka; but they sell it and it's expensive!! You can drink while the TV is turned down so you can't hear it; while there is no music on and while they ignore you and talk amongst themselves behind the bar. Rude!! The glasses/beakers that the drinks were served in were neat; but there was barely anything in there to drink at all; and for nearly $10!!! Don't get me started on the food and how when your ordering they make you think the side comes with it by asking; ""What's your side?"" only to be given your bill to see that sides are extra. The sandwich was just like one you could've made at home. Not even worth a description. I really hate it but 1 star is all I can give. I hope they make it big with Dirt Flavored Vodka. [REVIEW_3] Awesome little shop.  The owner really knows his stuff and you can tell he loves his work.  They have tires and other parts you won't find anywhere else. [REVIEW_4] The pizza was horrible had to send it back.. Even though we didn't get a new one they tried charging us for it even though we literally only took a bite.. The server avoided talking to us about it and we had to get her attention and she said she will talk to the manager about it and came back making it seem like they were doing us a favor. I do not recommend this place. [REVIEW_5] Best thai food in the area.  Everything was authentic and delicious.  Will definitely be back again and again.",2
71,"[REVIEW_1] Terrible selection; even worse quality. Big mistake. Skip this place. Not worth the price! [REVIEW_2] Bad experience in every way! Kept me waiting for no apparent reason; wasn't nice at all and did a terrible job on my brows. Aside from feeling scalped I am also uneven. All this for top dollar. Never again. [REVIEW_3] This has been one of my favorite chains for a while. I will not visit this one again. Slowest service I can remember anywhere. Food was cold when I got it. I will not be returning. [REVIEW_4] McDonalds... What do you need to know?..   They serve the purpose. I'd complain about the inaudible Spanish fellow working the drive through but why would I expect much else..  Update:  they just charged me .25 cents for ranch..  I'm pretty wealthy actually but this stuff is so annoying.  I handed him a dollar; took 4 of them and walked to the trash can to throw away 3 of them as I only needed one.  I feel I made my point.. [REVIEW_5] Change the name of this place to ""$12 a night just to park at this dump"" and maybe there is a chance at more than one star because I never made it past the less than persuasive garage attendant. It is trashy but common to charge customers park if you are located downtown or adjacent to the airport. This place is neither and has no excuse. It is located at the corner of bad neighborhood and interstate noise.",0
72,[REVIEW_1] LOVE this new Italian Market restaurant. The waiters were as nice and helpful as can be. The food was phenomenal - DO NOT miss the short rib pasta. We had probably 6 or 7 dishes (plus dessert) and the only thing that wasn't basically perfect was the duck with cauliflower rice - the cauliflower rice was quite salty; but other than that; overall flavor of it was also great. I would order everything we got again; including the delicious desserts; and can't wait to try the rest of the menu! [REVIEW_2] Excellent!!! Got the broiled octopus!!! Super tender!!!! Excellent service !! Server was on point all time !!! Desserts are awesome !!!!! [REVIEW_3] This amazing Korean take out only establishment is  in The H-Mart Plaza located @ Cheltenham &Old York Road. It is right next to where H-Mart  begins; across from Paris Baguette.They have an incredible selection of delicious hot and cold prepared foods.Outstanding choices to die for are the spicy chicken pieces(breast) w/sweet & sour sauce; wings(rival Cafe Soho; but cheaper); and the spicy blue  crab soup.Everything I have tried here has been nothing short of fresh and delicious. Other items you can't go wrong with are the Soft Tofu Seafood Soup; japchae;(although I prefer the H-mart japchae cause you get like twice as much for the same price);the fried squid;gimbap; box lunches; mak kimchi;and savory pancakes.  Their prices are incredibly reasonable with most things $5-$6. The box lunches are $6 and I had an amazing one last week consisting of Beef Bulgogi; Rice; Kimchi; Japchae; 2 pan fried savory dumplings and one sweet fried thing that I had no idea what it was 'cept it was incredible! I think it was some type of deep-fried flour-type ball of goodness.I'm still dreaming of that lunch. Not all items are always available. There sometimes is a bit of a language barrier; however most things are labeled and the woman who work there are friendly ans will help you as much as they can.  I always check in on this place when I shop @ H-Mart to see if they have the Spicy Blue Crab soup. Today I lucked out and they had some. There was a woman who was buying like 10 qts. of the stuff. Turns out she is taking back home to Wisconsin to freeze it. You know it's special when folks come from out of state to buy it.  Some of their foods are pretty spicy for occidental palates; but isn't that what Korean food is supposed to be? I love this place! [REVIEW_4] Muriel's is wonderful. Great food and impeccable service. We ate in the dining room for lunch one day and another time just popped into the bar at the back for a drink and cooling off.  Zach the bartender is amazing!  And also a cutie. :) [REVIEW_5] Excellent italian food at good prices.  On weekends you need a reservation.  It is small; the tables are close to one another; and it is loud.  I can understand how it could bug people; and if the food wasn't so good; it would bug me.  Overall though; the crowd; noise; size; only add to the experience of being at a popular restaurant with good food.,5
73,"[REVIEW_1] Wow; just wow!  The food was unbelievable.  No photo since I scarfed it down before I thought to snap a picture.  We got there just before noon and there were 3-4 people in line.  All-in-all we were there a good 15 min.  Not bad.  Everything everyone said is absolutely true.  So fresh; so yummy.  I was a little surprised that the rice/chick pea dish was cold (everything except the chicken and fallafel were); but it was delish none-the-less.  For $10; my platter included the most amazing smelling (and tasting) grilled chicken; a rice and chick pea mixture; hummus; a small scoop of the best fruit salad I've ever eaten; some sort of greens; and a nice hunk of crusty bread (I got the nose).  I'll definitely go back again! [REVIEW_2] BEST haircut I've ever had!  I recently moved to the Reno/Sparks area from the San Francisco area; and was a tad bit nervous about finding a new hairdresser.  I searched the internet; and decided on Shearz and specifically asked for Katie based on Yelp reviews.  My experience exceeded my expectations.  Katie was so patient listening to my concerns; but beyond that; gave me the best haircut ever.  I've paid three times the price at some 'boutique' salons in the Bay area; and have never received a better haircut.  This is the place to go! [REVIEW_3] Good portions; good prices; yummy food. That's all.  Wish they had more menu items with avocado though! [REVIEW_4] Fantastic classic Indian food; and very well executed.  Great atmosphere; great service; and delicious fare paired with traditional Indian beers. I will definitely be going back. [REVIEW_5] Just visited Station 52 today for lunch and was disappointed.  Food was mediocre at best. The nachos were a joke; the salsa is not fresh; all food seems to be frozen and reheated. They display specials on a blackboard as you enter but fail to mention they are only valid at the bar. Found this out once we received the bill. My wife ordered the Greek chicken pita which comes with fries and she asked to have old bay fries instead of standard fries. We get the bill and they charged us for a basket of old bay fries and when questioned why the charge for a basket; they said the Greek Pita came with chips but we didn't even get the chips.  The waitress then says ""oh I thought you wanted to sub fries for the chips"" then why did we get charged the full amount for the basket of fries; there should have been some discount if it was a sub. The waitress completely forgot my drink refill and brought it out with the check about 10-15 minutes after she took my glass. Overall very bad experience; won't be back.",4
74,[REVIEW_1] Jones has the look; feel; and most importantly; taste; of an upscaled American diner.   The menu is a good size; lots of options for people  but not so much as to make me concerned for the amount of ingredients that need to be stocked. Perfect for a weekend brunch.  The secret here is the staff. Our server was one of the best I have ever had. She was friendly and efficient; making great suggestions (pickle juice in a Bloody Mary? Awesome!); keeping our coffees refilled; and keeping us updated on the status of our drink and food orders. Everything came out perfectly and pretty quickly.   Our food was excellent; and serving gravy on the side for chicken and waffles is a fantastic idea. The heuvos rancheros were nice and light; and our request for sriracha was gladly met.   Overall; one of the best experiences I have had in this part of the city; and we will certainly be back; and bringing friends to join us! [REVIEW_2] This place is gross.  The bathroom was dirty; with peeling paint and rusting fixtures.  Old AC unit made horrible noises every time it shut off.  The previous guests left some sort of food in the microwave; indicating that it had not been cleaned.  The rates were low; but the Howard Johnson or Motel 6 next door couldn't possibly be worse.  Not worth it; go somewhere else. [REVIEW_3] They take advantage of people who doesn't speak English and sign them up for a membership. They have ridiculous rules about cancelling membership but luckily for my father; he was from CA. I sent them a message via their website in December saying I have a copy of his license and I'd like to e-mail them to prove that he's not from the area and have his membership cancelled. No one bothered to reply back with an e-mail address nor physical mailing address since January was around the corner and they can rob my father of that extra month of membership fee. No wonder these thieves aren't successful as the two major gym we have nationwide. Sooner they get that through their thick skull and start having some decent customer service; sooner they'd be successful. Terrible experience. Don't use this place. You'll definitely get robbed. [REVIEW_4] Only been here for breakfast but all three times have sat out on the pet-friendly patio; I usually bring my own travel water bowl but forgot it this time and they were happy to provide me with a soup bowl.  Now on to my service; I've always been greeted with a cheery good morning and I absolutely adore the oatmeal. The egg-white; spinach & tomato breakfast sandwich is delicious. [REVIEW_5] Had brunch here yesterday. Nice relaxing time but terrible food.  Eggs looked and tasted like they had been held for a while after being cooked; not at all fresh. Salad on one plate had more dressing then salad; really inedible. What I did notice was the complete lack of bacon or sausage or anything pork related. Odd for a brunch; but maybe gypsies don't eat meat? The other thing I found was 1. It was 40 degrees in the bathroom; really really cold. 2. The wall next to our table really needed painting; or at least washing; food splatters and grease stains on the paint were really unappealing. The cute puffy wall coverings looked like someone used them as napkins over and over.  A tremendous disappointment after many really great experiences at Southern Cross.  It seems to me they can do a lot better; or close the place for a rehab.  We felt pretty ripped off with brunch; though the live music was awesome. Maybe dinner is better; breakfast is really hard to do well after all but I doubt we will ever find out as we have no intention of returning. In fact we cancelled our Valentine's Day reservation after this experience. Conshy girls up your game.,2
75,[REVIEW_1] Not very hungry for this meal which was too bad as everyone seemed to enjoy their burgers.  Definitely what you're looking for in a sports bar - loud; energetic; good food and lots of televisions but beat of all the customer service! Thank you Jelicia - sweet disposition and even amongst the crazy Saturday night college football chaos; she maintained a high level of professionalism; accuracy and dang; she was one of the nicest waitresses I've come across in a sports bar!  Thanks Jelicia! [REVIEW_2] Wendy and Leah at Preferred Rental Service are a life-saving team. They helped me to find the perfect place. Incredibly;  it all worked out in the very first try and within three days I am completely moved in and happy in my new home. I am grateful for their effort and would recommend their services to anyone looking to rent. Wendy and Leah were efficient and invested and clearly cared about the outcome of our work together. J.P. [REVIEW_3] So as an automotive shop owner I have customers ask all the time can you have my car detailed. Well I have to say after having Chuck do a few cars for customers and seeing the glee in their eyes when they see the job; I have to say he is amazing. Now add his great detail services along with the amazing job he does for me weekly between my wives car and my dually I am a very satisfied customer!!! Between a black SUV and a 4 door long bed dually that nobody likes to wash; Chuck puts a smile on my face every time I see him. Do yourself and your car a big favor call Chuck. Remember the sign of a great business is they are busy and the price is the price; somebody willing to cut corners and make deals does it because they need to!!! Chuck is fairly priced and amazing at what he does!!! You won't be disappointed. [REVIEW_4] Steamed buns for the adults. Beef & Broccoli for the kids. Great service. Good for kids. Food holds up if you opt to take out. Our favorite to go spot. [REVIEW_5] I love these guys. You couldn't ask for better customer service. My shoes needed more stretching after the first round; and they explained the process to me; stretched them again to perfection; and gave me some shoe spray for free! If you want expert service from helpful; welcoming people; this is the place.,5
76,"[REVIEW_1] Oh boy... why do I continue to torture myself with this KFC location? After 2 months of a diet I allow myself a cheat day and I stupidly (Why God; why?) pick this location for a fried chicken craving I had. Firstly; more than half the time my wife and I have been to this location they are always ""out"" of the extra crispy all white which is my go to order. It doesn't matyter the time of day OR day of week; ""Sorry sir; we just ran out"". How and WHY does this happen on a continual basis. Well; this time my wife had the forthought of recording the conversation in the drive thru. Sure enough; the female employe started with the ""Sorry maam; we don't have that enymore"". Well; someone must have seen my wife holding the cellphone up to the speaker box through the mirror because  another man started yelling something in the background and the lady said; ""Excuse me maam; we DO have some; if you'd like to wait 10 minutes we'll get it for you."" My wife said ""yes"" and waited for the order..... Well; WTH! She brought the order home; I opened the box and Yippie; a 3 piece ALL white freaking ORIGINAL recipe. Seriously? My wife felt horrible she didn't check the order before leaving but after all of that didn't feel it was necessary; and you know what; she shouldn't have to. Raise the minimum wage for fast food workers to $15 my %^#  !!! [REVIEW_2] Giving this review so that others know the honest truth.  DO NOT eat here!!!!!   We went here after 4pm on Wednesday thinking that there would be crab legs..there is no posting stating that it is only Friday - Sunday. That was the first issue.  The food is not good. There is not a variety at all and assuming since it is a weekday they dont like to make sure what is on the buffet is fresh. The food was not of great quality ; minimal and cold.   The hibachi was meeehhhhh....I don't like that they have fresh eggs on the counter and they are very warm. They should have them in ice since they are sitting out for a while.   This restaurant should not be called a buffet. I was VERY DISAPPOINTED and will not return or tell anyone to go there. I remember seeing a post stating that they were trying to get things going as they were just opening. This restaurant has been opened long enough to know what people like and how to keep food hot and fresh..also a better variety.  If you are going to be in the Daytona area try Hibachi Grill & Supreme Buffet...this is a REAL asian buffet.  Imperial Asian Buffet needs to do better. [REVIEW_3] The new Bacon-Bleu cheeseburger is excellent! Probably one of the best fast food burgers I've had in a while! Dave Thomas would be proud! [REVIEW_4] the customer service and quality of nails here is impressive. I called and made an appointment for 6:30PM (at 6PM). The women on the phone said no problem. I show up and the place was packed; but the women said I had an appointment and took me right away.  I was glad I made an appointment. She was quick and my nails look great! I got a no chip manicure. Place is clean and have a wide variety of colors to choose from. [REVIEW_5] The customer service was horrible. I called to place an order for pick up. The kids menu was not posted online so I asked the lady who answered for the kids menu. She proceeded to tell me that she was too busy to tell me and placed me on hold. However; she didn't realize that I could still hear her. She proceeded to complain that someone was on the phone asking her to read the entire menu and she didn't have time. I told her to cancel the order and I drove up there. When I got there and asked to speak to a manager; I discovered that the person who answered the phone was the manager. I have never experienced such rude and unprofessional customer service. RUDE RUDE RUDE!",2
77,"[REVIEW_1] Texas Roadhouse does not give you the steak you ask for in the case. I have been here multiple times; asked for a specific steak; and have a steak come out for my meal that is a completely different steak. This is such a hoax; tourist attraction as part of the restaurants; and really dishonest. This restaurant shouldn't offer this if they cannot actually provide their customers with what they ask for. [REVIEW_2] Food was pretty good. We had a long day and it was good to have delicious indo-chinese food. [REVIEW_3] BEST ICE CREAM. Why? -soooo many flavors -Unique flavors are creative and taste better than you would think -Classic flavors better than any chain ice cream shop -good price -fun atmosphere -big scoops! [REVIEW_4] A++  I have to say; this place is great and one of the biggest reasons why is their bar staff. There is a bartender named ""Ally"". She is always kind and attentive. Everyone can be crammed at the bar; and the employees running around like their hair is on fire; and Ally still treats you like you're her only customer.  Cool vibe; great indoor and outdoor seating. Great addition to the Funk Zone. Definitely go!! PS: Say hi to Ally for me :-) [REVIEW_5] Love nails is the best nail salon and spa in Tampa. Ive been going there for over 10 years now and I haven't once had a bad experience.  Every employee and Vicki; the owner; are super friendly and hospitable. It is always a great experience!",4
78,[REVIEW_1] Excited to try this new; nice looking burger place in town and finally got a chance eat there - very disappointed. It's it set up as a fast food restaurant; but they charge like a high end operation. Missed the mark by a mile. The burger was expensive; side were severely overpriced. Fries were boring; ordinary and weren't very fresh. The bright spots would be the fried zucchini and the ghost pepper cheese. I will stop at Red Robin next time for better service; better food and better value. [REVIEW_2] Awesome place to visit Grants home is full of history with the old out buildings the tour guide was very helpful and knew everything you could ever ask its for sure worth the time even more if you take the time to go to Grants farm across the street [REVIEW_3] Dr. McCrady and Staff are top notch!! When my fur grand baby moved from SD to Tucson with serious medical issues Dr. McCrady has had all the best medical advice ; treatment and care available for our boy!  Dr. McCrady and staff have been there for us many times and each time with love and compassion! Those that have reviews stating they are a little pricey (disagree); BUT ... well you get what you pay for and we have been given the BEST of care to our family! We will not go any where else!  Thank you Dr. McCrady and VCA Valley Animal Hospital!!! [REVIEW_4] I thought this burger joint was phenomenal! I ordered a chicken burger with pepper jack; bacon; guacamole; pico and ranch and the flavors were excellent. The chicken was AMAZING. I also thought our waiter was very attentive and helped with recommendations as well. This is a very cute/ hip place that seemed filled with the typical gluten free hipster but I really enjoyed it! [REVIEW_5] Fair Grinds Coffee House takes away all the feelings of distress at having to complete hours and hours of work and transforms it into a pleasurable--or at least tolerable-- experience.  It not only provides me with the space I need to focus and a good cup of coffee to help me stay awake and motivated; but unlike other coffee houses; it actually offers a great atmosphere and vibe! I always feel extremely cozy and positive in the space. Books on the bookshelves; art on the walls; dimmed lights and colors all around are just some of characteristics that create a wonderful ambiance.    It truly is a local coffee house like no other-- and I love all of it! Best of all; it's in my lovely Mid City neighborhood.   I am going to make it a point to visit more often!,4
79,[REVIEW_1] this was so worth it.  first; what an awesome innovation - the mini-scoop sampler!  i can never decide what to get; and this time i got to choose FOUR flavors!  i got the chocolate; lavendar honey; coffee butter pecan; and the pumpkin cheesecake.  the butter pecan was in a league of its own; but closely followed by the honey.  not only were these flavorful; but all four were perfectly dense creaminess.  it's a good thing i don't leave near the place. [REVIEW_2] This place is game changer for the neighborhood. We got some take out tonight and the food was absolutely  delicious.  I'm really stoked they moved in and I'm newly smitted by southern Latin food.  The family who owns it also seem very sweet!  I think this place is exactly  what the neighborhood needed! [REVIEW_3] I ordered a big order to go from them and it was my first time as well. They called me to make sure they got it right and were super nice and helpful! The food was your typical kurdish/middle eastern plate; but extremely delicious! You can tell it was fresh and well made! My boys and i loved it so much; we will definitely order from there again! [REVIEW_4] Nowadays we have so many places we can go into to pass time or to have a meeting with a long lost friend or business meeting; from my last experiment at this location I was impressed with seeing a gentleman a part of the staff with a long beard and the amount of multi tasking; he helped me with a question and recommendations I had about a drink and food choice for the experience while being able to fully continue the work he was assigned or is daily assigned. Thanks again big beard gentleman (will get name when I am there again) and to the experience and company. Thank you for both of your time. [REVIEW_5] I LOVE this place. I have dreams about the Bananas Fosters Pancakes. Owners are super sweet and really try to take care of you. Place is small and the line is long so get there very early!,5
80,"[REVIEW_1] I would not recommend using Alexander Bourne or Patina Shoe Parlor for any service. This ""business man"" is not who or what he claims to be. He is not nice; professional; or reliable. I am baffled at this man's success within the local community; all things come to the light eventually.   My personal headache with this I met the ""proprietor"" out last summer; he was a nice enough guy; we had a bunch of mutual acquaintances. When he told me what he did; as shoe junkie I was happy to support a young local business as I too have a young local business; and strongly believe in supporting young entrepreneurs and craftsmen.   Fast forward to January; when I called to have my shoes picked up; as Patinas had transitioned into a mobile service. Alexander came to my house at 8am to pick up my shoes that needed repair; five pairs (4 heels; one pair of flats). He requested I pay upfront; being that it was early in the morning; we had numerous mutual contacts; and he is a young business with hesitation agreed. Thankfully I wrote a check tragically it was for nearly $250. What I was told I was buying was a six pair sole and heel package; the remaining pair I could call in at any time. A receipt would be emailed to me; and my shoes would be done in 10-14 days. 10 days later I call to inquire about my shoes; they are not ready. Day 14; I get voicemail. Day 20 I get hung up on. This persisted. I sent emails; Facebook messages; texts. I get no response.   Eventually I get a weird and vague communication from Alexander's ""assistant"". Nothing is resolved; and then I am blocked from any means of contacting the business and its owner.   In March 3 months later I run into Alexander; we have a hostile and rude exchange. He proceeded to call me a peon and other nasty names; denying having my shoes. In April I see this individual at another event; he laughs as I walk away knowing good and well what is up. Literally as I am prepping to sue this questionable character calls; yep I was that upset he calls and claims there was a mix up; he indeed has my shoes and will drop them off later that day. I give him my work address via a text and email. No response.   He shows up the next morning; doesn't say a word and shows me the 4 heels he has repaired. The work is not bad; I have had much better work done elsewhere without the drama. I inquire about my gold flats; give a description and am told he would look for them; No apology; no explanation given; nothing.   I get an email asking for the shoes to be described; which I find odd considering that I just did this; and that I would get an apology letter later in the day. In my response I suggest a refund; my other shoes found/returned or replaced; only to be answered with ""I never had your flats; and a link to his website. No apology; no receipt.   Funny; he doesn't have my flats like he didn't have my shoes; like he did not remember who I was in March before he decided I was all these terrible random things; and cursed me out.   The lies; deception and utter disregard for customer service and human decency is too much.  I responded professionally requesting a refund; shoes replacement; receipt; and apology. I got zero response.   This whole exchange was really frustrating; and unprofessional. At this point I am out a pair of flats; it's not the end of the world but it is disappointing. It's unfortunate that someone feels entitled to treat others in this fashion; to deceive and steal.  While I am elated that I have my heels back; the reality the work Bourne did was mediocre and his customer service is HORRIBLE! I will chalk this up as a lesson to be careful who I choose to do business with. Research everyone; and do not use Alexander Bourne or Patina Shoe Parlor for ANY  service. You will be disappointed; ripped off and or treated poorly. Just go elsewhere and save yourself the trouble. [REVIEW_2] Went here on a Friday night awkward because no system for how to get a table. The margarita I had was really weak. Asked for extra limes and never got any. The chicken tacos are incredibly bland. Literally chicken and salsa verde nothing else; which would normally be okay; but the chicken didn't have any taste. Got charged $2 for a little cheese to put on my taco for taste. Ambience was cool and different; but everything else gets a thumbs down. Service was marginal at best. My friends had their orders messed up. First and last time coming. [REVIEW_3] Place is dirty; customer service is bad; small portions of food; leaves you hungry and over price. I would not recommend this place at all! Went on 03/15/17 will never go again. [REVIEW_4] Went here twice over last weekend.  The first time I was not too impressed by the food quality but the beer was very good according to everyone that drank it.    However the second time they let us host a wedding toast after a friend's wedding at the river walk.  These guys are really nice and were unbelievably generous with their space.  They let us bring in our own champagne and cupcakes to setup for the after party of our friends nuptials.  We agreed that people would still order off the menu but what a great group of guys for helping us out after we needed a space and the bar manager at the Silver Legacy cancelled on us at the last minute. [REVIEW_5] Went here with high hopes considering it's handmade and most of the reviews said it was good. It was worse than a little Ceasers Pizza. The sauce tasted like it was from a can like school lunch. The cheese was terrible quality; even though they advertise it's 100% real it;and really isn't. The garlic knots were okay; better than the pizza but was not fond of the chunks of garlic on top. There are so many better pizza places to spend your money.",1
81,"[REVIEW_1] Holy bat crap; this place is amazing. Go to place in St. Pete; anything on the menu was good. Food coma! [REVIEW_2] I've been meaning to write this review for a week now! Unpacking was the worst part of this move thanks to these guys! Quick; efficient; and fairly priced I will always be using this company. Antoine Sebastian and Brian were amazing! I recommend requesting them! All in all our move was a little less stressful. [REVIEW_3] One of the worst customer service I have ever experienced at any Toyota service center! Twice in the past half year; I have had very poor customer service here. The first time was when I bought my car in specifically asking for an inspection of my right front tire; informing them it had been leaking air a few days ago and I had to pull over to get air pumped in. They found nothing... only 2 days later; that same tire went completely flat. I took my car to a local auto shop; and they found a huge nail stuck in the tire that would've been found if Toyota had done a careful inspection the first time.  Second experience was even worse and more shocking. I took my car in for servicing on a Saturday morning. The service person could not answer many of my questions; and when he stated that he was new; I kindly asked him how long he'd been working there (thinking that if he was so new that he didn't know a lot of info; that I'd ask another representative to help me). Out of nowhere; he yelled out in an extremely rude and angry manner;  ""That's none of your business ! ... I won't have you harrassing me..."" Everyone in the room was startled and turned around to see why he was shouting so loudly.  Perhaps he acted this way because there was no manager on duty; however; this behavior is customer service at its worst. As a person in the service industry myself (I am a physician and my patients' health; safety and satisfaction come first); I am shocked by his blatantly inappropriate and unacceptable behavior. This behavior reflects poorly on his company; and I hope nothing like this happens to any other customers in the future. I went to another shop to have my car serviced; where customers would be treated more politely and with respect. [REVIEW_4] We ate here a few months ago; and I forgot to review it.  I've forgotten the details; but I really enjoyed the meal.  We'll be back seasonally; as the menu changes to follow the sun. [REVIEW_5] My boyfriend and i tried out this place and we were surprised how good the food and service was despite it being packed! My boyfriend ordered a hot pot soup and it was delicious. I had the pad Thai and love it. Very fast and attentaive service. The vibe of the place is pretty cool too; make sure to get outdoor seating; it's beautiful and worth the wait.",4
82,[REVIEW_1] Very unfriendly to people with dietary restrictions/allergies. Refused to make an accommodation.  Wouldn't come here again. [REVIEW_2] The waitstaff were attentive and very nice! That is the only positive comment that I have for this establishment: I waited fir over an hour while moderate celebrities were ushered in. After all of the waiting the food was not good. Grits were hard and not seasoned; shrimp & fish over cooked; it was a disappointment. [REVIEW_3] Everybody in our lab is a fan of their food; and we all come from different parts of the world and glad we agreed on this immediately. It's a frequent lab lunch spot. Their buffet is just fantastic; everything is cooked spot on and nowhere beat their price. I normally have to skip dinner after their lunch buffet cuz I just can't stop eating over there. [REVIEW_4] Amazing tacos. Don't judge a book by its cover. It may look like its run down and no good but the food is awesome. Street tacos are bomb.com [REVIEW_5] Just an update regarding the only complaint in my first review of Kajuns: the smoke. They've since installed a couple of smoke eaters that have made the air extremely breathable for people who; like me; have sensitivities to cigarette smoke. I previously would get headaches because of the smoke if I stayed at Kajuns too long; as I am wont to do; but now I can hardly notice that people are smoking while I'm sitting inside the bar! (When I leave; it's a different story as my clothes still smell like smoke; but that's a compromise I am willing to make.) Just goes to show you how dedicated the Kajuns staff is to improving the experiences of their customers. Thank you Kajuns!,3
83,"[REVIEW_1] I wish I could say it was not an incredibly unpleasant experience. She was very loud and very rude. [REVIEW_2] I have visited this establishment over the years and can only say it continues a downward slide to depths of mediocrity I thought unattainable for a business to remain open.  I stopped in again today solely because the usual Saturday performer was not playing. His replacement was a welcome change from the overly affected ridiculous twang rendition of every song played by the usual performer.  Equally welcome was the absence of his asinine and drunken ""roadie"" riding his non existent coat tails and harassing the staff. Laughably billed as an Idol and Voice contestant who has yet to make it past round one of local auditions.  As for Kelly Days; beyond disappointing! If someone can explain the economics behind a 12 oz draft of costing 4.25 and a 16 oz can of the same brand  costing only 3.25 I will nominate you for the Nobel Prize in economics.   Not sure why the previous manager; Jay; left but I wish him the best. The current staff and management falls just short of oblivious which combined with their unique brand of indifference and incompetence leaves one wondering how the doors stay open. Did I try the food? Heavens no! Not making that mistake again or the aforementioned ever again! [REVIEW_3] My family and company used mayflower in late sept of 2013. What a complete mess; from the packing to the delivery. We moved from Southern California to Minot North Dakota for work. We had so much damaged items that it was hard to keep track of. We were told by a rep that our items had been off loaded to a warehouse after loading up at our house to be loaded back up in a moving van (with air ride) well this didn't happen; the same rental freight trailer that was used at the loading showed up at delivery; another lie from the company.The scheduling date was a mess also; the funny thing is the company reps in Minot tried to blame us for their mistakes. We have been in contact with California for this to be resolved and to this date 1-3-14 we still haven't received a call say sorry for the f!?"" Ups. Our salesman in California turned out to be just that a salesman; he didn't give a rats a!$ about anything and refused to return my calls. I would never recommend this company to anyone. Please check out other companies first !!!  Hey mayflower executives I am sure you know who I am ; feel free to call me to apologize and to get input on how this should have been handled !! I would not have given 1 star except it would not let me continue to post !!! [REVIEW_4] A friend of mine recommended this restaurant when i told him i would be in new Orleans. I went with a group of friends with high expectations. Since we were 7 we waited for more than an hour to get seated; which we took in good stride we just sat somewhere outside and chatted. When we were finally seated; it took the them about 15 minutes to come and take our orders and then...the ordeal started; the waiter told one of my friends to hurry up and order(he had just delivered the menus) or he will go and serve another table. There were about 4 of us on the table who had not ordered yet and we asked if he can take our orders first instead while my friend made up his mind but no...he said we had to follow the order we were seated. We let that slide; but then he delivered the drinks in a leaking glass and the food took another hour to come. People who arrived after we were seated had finished eating before we even had our food. Needless to say...the whole experience was so terrible there was nothing special about the food. [REVIEW_5] Just had a ""ramen"" delivered... All I'm going to say is; you're better off eating the instant ramen soup! First time I tried this place and I'm sure it will be the last.",0
84,[REVIEW_1] 4 stars for carved turkey and smoked sausage; 5 for genuine staff and Diet Mountain Dew!! [REVIEW_2] Terrible mixed drinks. Our table got four different drinks and no on like their drink. I got the desert highball and it smelled like the fruit mix was spoiled. On top of that it was just bland; totally watered down. [REVIEW_3] I came here once & never again! The girls working know nothing about the food & basically shove a menu in your hand! I wasn't impressed with the food myself; it was very bland & pricey for 1 meal. [REVIEW_4] LOVE this new Italian Market restaurant. The waiters were as nice and helpful as can be. The food was phenomenal - DO NOT miss the short rib pasta. We had probably 6 or 7 dishes (plus dessert) and the only thing that wasn't basically perfect was the duck with cauliflower rice - the cauliflower rice was quite salty; but other than that; overall flavor of it was also great. I would order everything we got again; including the delicious desserts; and can't wait to try the rest of the menu! [REVIEW_5] The only place in Tucson I let wax my eyebrows! I always go to Jennifer and she is amazing. She selects an eyebrow shape that is most complimentary to your face using different stencils. Then she carefully sculpts them using hard wax; not strips. This is so much better for your skin! They do an absolutely amazing job; and for only $20!,3
85,[REVIEW_1] St. Louis isn't short on fantastic sandwich shops; but Blues City Deli is awesome. They venture into ALL things sandwich combos (even with the well beloved St. Louis favorite pretzel roll) - great; tasty; classics and well-priced. Check out their menu for all their tried and true favorites; or better yet; wait to arrive at the door and check their Daily Special Board. There's no question from the line snaking out (for a quarter mile) of their corner shop; DAILY; hovering over the lucky eaters munching-in on their bench seating outdoors; this is the King of Sandwich Eateries. [REVIEW_2] This place is nice and open.  The food is great and the staff is very friendly.  I don't really have anything insightful to say; so you'll just have to go to experience the goodness. [REVIEW_3] I absolutely love this place! I go there about 5 times a month and ate almost everything on the menu at least once. My favorite is the B-nice cheesesteak (I get the wrap). My favorite part about this place is that they offer all their sandwiches as wraps. I wish they would offer wheat wraps but i'm just getting a little picky.  Their smoked wings; ribs; and quesadillas; burgers and fries are all awesome. Margarita pitchers are strong and fairly priced during happy hour. Everything I order here is amazing. [REVIEW_4] Open 24/7 plenty of equipment never too crowded classes also available the staff is always friendly and willing to help the district manager stops in as well every week to Make sure everything is on the up and up and my membership is good everything! [REVIEW_5] Ok had Sunday lunch with my mother and grandmother here and it was just terrible. Our server didn't even tell us his name and took forever for him to take our drink order. We asked for sweet and low with one of our unsweet teas and didn't receive it. Had to ask for it again to then receive the sweet and low. We ordered the bloomin onion and the chesse fries. The bloomin onion was not the onion the restaurant usually uses because it was on the spicy side. The chesse fires when on the ok side since they did not put much chesse or bacon on the appetizer. So in all reality we ordered a plate of fires with a little chesse and bacon. My grandmother ordered the 6oz steak and it was also on the spicy side. I however ordered the same thing but I ordered mine medium rare but when I got my steak it was rare instead of medium rare and also was really spicy.  We then had to ask for a bottle of steak sauce because if you ask for steak sauce for a party of three you will only get one tiny cup full of steak sauce for the whole table. Had to order a to go order for my father couldn't make it to lunch and our waiter said he would put it in after we had finished our meal. When we finished our food and the waiter gave us our check we still haven't received our to go order. Had to sit and extra five to ten minutes to get that said order. Lets just say we gave a bad tip. Be caution to this place not worth a hundred dollar bill for a spicy mouth and bad experience!,4
86,"[REVIEW_1] Went here on a Saturday night was seated right away I was shocked. Our server was amazing even helped pick out some drinks. I would suggest the white ale! Delicious! The food was amazing the best sushi I have had! I would drive 45 mins again to come back! [REVIEW_2] The staff was so kind; the food was delicious; and I love the location. I highly recommend the mojito and the cassoulet! [REVIEW_3] If you're not an overweight middle-aged white guy; or a 20-something female wearing a Hooter's uniform; don't bother looking for assistance at this location.  And if you do manage to corral a ""specialist""; or they deign to take a moment out of chatting with each other in clumps - clumps of overweight middle-aged white guys; that is -  you'll be lucky to get pointed in kind of the right direction. But be prepared to endure a lot of sighing and eye rolling before they do.  Update : after year or so of avoiding this place I stopped in today for some cabinet hardware. While I was shopping; the associate manager Kelly and another employee barged between me and the merchandise; talking amongst themselves. Neither of them bothered to look up; to say "" excuse me"" ; to offer to help; or even just say ""hey - how about getting the h*** out of our way"" . When confronted; rather than apologize; Kelly's first choice was to explain why whatever it was she was doing was more important than greeting or offering assistance to a customer. (She did eventually offer a snarky and clearly insincere apology.)   So it makes sense that the staff at this location behave like some customers are invisible. They're following the lead of the management. [REVIEW_4] Happy hour here is great! We ordered the corn rangoons; which were a nice combination of savory and sweet; and the bulgogi dumplings; along with the happy hour cocktail special. If we had stopped there; the bill would have been $24. But the dumplings were so good we had to get another order and the cocktails were so good we had to each get (ahem) two more. And the food in general was so delicious that we wanted to try some entrees. The brisket ramen noodles were perfectly cooked and the meat was very tender. The shrimp dan dan noodles were peanutty and creamy. Service was very attentive and friendly and even with all the booze; the bill was more than reasonable. Can't wait to come back! [REVIEW_5] The lady who works here is a miracle worker! I came in with a couple pairs of pants that needed to be hemmed; and a suit jacket whose sleeves needed to be shortened (both of which are not quick and easy; since suits are normally lined and it's a lot of work). I also needed it to be done fast - I was leaving the country the next day. Not only did she do all of these alterations in a day; they were also excellently done - neat and professional - and now I have a beautiful suit that fits me brilliantly for my business trip! Plus; they take all credit cards - including Amex! - and have very reasonable hours.   Definitely returning.",4
87,[REVIEW_1] A wonderful way to spend a few nights while you're house is being worked on. Seems like a true vacation at a beautiful resort. Lani took great care of us at Cafe Milano! [REVIEW_2] We visit every weekend for breakfast; it's a very nice and cozy cafe with good food and great service. Free wifi too! We recommend it 100%. [REVIEW_3] I needed a quick eyebrow waxing and was skeptical of where to go. My eyebrows are thin already and I didn't want someone to ruin them. I walked into European Wax Center and got my eyebrows perfectly shaped; in under 5 minutes; for $10. It was honestly faster than getting in and out of line at Starbucks! I will definitely come here in the future. [REVIEW_4] Had lunch with girlfriends.  So happy to finally get down there; super yummy.  The cashier could have been more friendly and helpful; but I'll be back for sure!!! [REVIEW_5] My favorite Latin place in town! Favorites: Papusas; flan; green salsa on the table; chicken tacos; napales tacos; chorizo tacos; enchiladas; and the chimichanga is huge. Great burritos and aguas frescos too! Super fast and inexpensive!,5
88,[REVIEW_1] Great service; nice atmosphere; delicious food.  My friend's shrimp wasn't as he expected and the manager comped his entire dinner although we didn't ask for it.    Had the fajita burrito with grilled chicken - delicious! [REVIEW_2] Great spot for pho! Broth is very good. I ordered No. 51 (small) and it was filling. Would definitely come back again when I'm in Philly. [REVIEW_3] Wow! What a great dining adventure! Huge rolls; good sake; good beer and HOT tea- was all awesome! [REVIEW_4] A very welcome authentic and delicious addition to the neighborhood.   This is the real thing! We stopped in for the lunch special and were not disappointed. My partner and I were in Vientiane last year.  The food here is on par with what we had in Laos.  Love that they cater to vegans and vegetarians and that the food is as mild or spicy as you like.  We had the coconut soup and the spicy tom yum soup to start - both excellent. Then the spring roll and the pork dumplings - not so great. They only offered 1 spring roll (though it was very tasty and perfectly cooked) but the pork dumplings were bland and flavorless. However the main courses - chicken with sweet basil sauce for my partner; and the pad kee mao were delicious and nicely sized portions.  Overall?  We really enjoyed our meal; the restaurant was very clean and the staff friendly and welcoming and we were surprised that the restaurant was fairly full at lunchtime - always a good sign. Can't wait to eat here again. This will definitely be a go-to spot in the neighborhood. [REVIEW_5] I don't know that I'm actually cool enough to hang out at Coffeebar; but I do love it. In fact; their Lavender Latte and I are besties. I've never had a drink that I've simultaneously wanted to smell; drink; and bathe in that is also caffeinated. Way to go; Coffeebar. 10 points to you.  But seriously; Coffeebar is the bees knees. I love the location; the interior is funky. Oh tiny cups with bicycles; bless you for being so little and adorable; yet filled with caffeine. Bless you.  Their food offerings are also pretty fantastic. Lots of GF options; yummy breakfast quiche; gelato that I will look at longingly; crepes (including a Nutella crepe. A Nutella crepe so good it makes God cry) and tea. Plus beer. Plus wine.  Add all of this + hipsters and it equals my favorite coffee place in Reno.,5
89,"[REVIEW_1] Ordered for pick up and was told 45 minutes. Arrived 45 minutes after ordering and waited another 45 minutes for cold food. Never again. I'll never pay 40$ for an hour and a half wait for cold food. I'll go to the place on the next corner and get my food faster and hotter. [REVIEW_2] In and Out is the worst neighborhood take out place in West Oak Lane. I ordered breakfast (I know lol) from them about a month ago; and received pancakes that were drenched in some weird butter substance and home fries that were rock hard. I spoke to a man named Tommy; who offered all kinds of excuses about the food before finally offering me a credit.   Fast forward to this morning. I decided to give them another chance because I was hungry and had a credit. I call and am greeted by a young woman who informed me that I had two people waiting before me and asked me to hold. She proceeded to place me on hold before I could even respond. I held for about 3 minutes before she picked up. I placed my order and then explained that I had a credit. She stated she would need to look in ""the book"" for my credit. Another two minutes of waiting and surprise; she can't locate my credit. I ask to speak to a manager; and she says that the manager is out doing deliveries. Seriously...wth? She tells me I can call back later. Umm no; I'm hungry now.  I ended up canceling my order. This place is beyond ratchet and I will never order from them again. The food at Bruno's and Bally's is much better...so is their level of cleanliness and customer service. [REVIEW_3] This is my first review and I really felt it was needed.  I love to cook but also love eating out . It's very exciting to see all the new restaurants opening up around town and I really want them all to succeed. I've been to Nox  many times now. I have to say it's been so inconsistent last night being the Worst!!!  Waitstaff were inexperienced; appetizers came out with the dinners and only one was hot.  Had to send two out of the three dinners back for various reasons.  As you know Restaurants seem to come and go around here so please guys pay attention and remember you're only as good as your staff.  Sincerely [REVIEW_4] Their pizza is pretty good; service is usually cool inside. But today I ordered a delivery for the first time; the driver was very insulting to me. When I open my door she asked me about a car across the street with a guy in the driver's seat. I replied ""I don't know;"" she said ""cus I don't wanna be set up to get robbed"". Mind you I already paid with my visa when I ordered; her behavior made me feel awkward as if I had done something wrong. I gave her the tip I had in my hand and said thank you; hoping that maybe if I remain polite she'll stop thinking so negative I just wanted some pizza not to be judged because of my surroundings or to be stereotyped. [REVIEW_5] Jazz brunch was amazing!   Food - everything we ordered was great! Thanks for all the yelp recommendations. We went with the shrimp and goat cheese crepe; shrimp and andouille sausage omlet; and eggs benedict. We were so stuffed we couldn't bring ourselves to order the bread pudding.   Music - at first we couldn't really hear the music; but to our pleasant surprise; the band moved from room too room and ended up playing right next to our table! The musicians were amazing. Loved all their energy and talent.   Highly recommend!",1
90,[REVIEW_1] We love good food and would rather have a fine meal in a mediocre space than a lousy meal in an elegant space.  Alas; our first (and last) experience here gave us a lousy meal in a mediocre setting.  * The space is drab and dreary. * Tables crammed too close together * Noise level excessively high - impossible to have a relaxed conversation; have to compete with too-loud talking at too-close tables; flatware and plates rattling on the stone tabletops * Cheesy; cheap paper napkins at a not-cheap restaurant * Worn; scuffed; cheap diner-type flatware  * Bread that came with the hummus was stale; tasteless * Rice and vegetable accompanied all four entrees - rice tasteless and lukewarm; greens mushy; overcooked; oily and unrecognizable * Entrees rushed out before we had finished our apps * For our wine; we were given old; small; worn-out flute-shaped glasses - totally inappropriate   All in all; an entirely disappointing BYO meal at any cost; but especially so for close to $160 including gratuity for four apps; four entrees; two desserts. [REVIEW_2] Place is great.. food was good and wings are killer. It does get very crowded later in the evening.. [REVIEW_3] One of those places when you leave you ask yourself what just happened? The food (pasta) was the smallest portion of food I've ever been served (served in what looked like a small cereal bowl) anywhere for a whopping $16 and it was terrible. The beer was high gravity bottled beer for $6.50 per 12 ounce bottle and the cheapest small glass of wine was over $9.00. My wife and I had the pasta and 1 beer each and got out for $60.00 somehow. I'm not sure why we as customers give in to actually paying for small/bad food but what can you do when you're with a group of people? I will never go back there; I'll stick to the more reasonable 12 South Taproom which is about 90 feet away on the same side of the road for much cheaper prices and the food is so much better. [REVIEW_4] Rock Bottom has changed it's name to better fit their aspirations and goals. Heroes Dive Center; owned and operated by 21 year Army veteran Shawn Carroll and his business partner John Catalano with emphasis on making diving accessible to all an the share in the adventure. Please come in and visit and see why you would want to learn how to or expand your diving adventures with the team at Heroes Dive Center. [REVIEW_5] Replaced 2 old 70s lennox with 2 new ones.  They did a great job and have been runnong for 3 years now.,3
91,[REVIEW_1] WOWZA !!!! We had the best of the best experience today!! We have been here several times and the serve was so so.... However this time the service was outstanding!! Timely!!!! And tasty!!! [REVIEW_2] Staff was very nice and helpful but we were extremely disappointed with the food. We ordered Eggplant Parmesan in which tasted like it came out of the frozen section from the grocery store and the spaghetti sauce tasted bitter as if they poured it out of the jar. We were totally disappoint in the food. [REVIEW_3] Ive been coming here since I was a little kid-my grandparents  live in the Santa Ynez Valley in Santa Barbara County. Google cold springs tavern and make a day trip to Solvang and the surrounding wineries. Great tri tip sandwiches! just an amazing HIDDEN restaurant. Yes it's kinda off the beaten path but you finally find it-you'll be very amazed! [REVIEW_4] Spending the day in Nawlin's ... got hungry and stopped in for a bite.  The wait was extremey long (45 minutes; but everyplace else was also packed); and they passed menus down the waiting line so that you could order the moment you were seated.  Prices were very steep; staff were rude; bathrooms were horrible (tiny single stall); and they rushed us out the moment our last forkfull was on the way to our mouths.  Total times:  45 minute wait; 15 minutes from order to service; 17 minutes until we were clear of the table!  Not a place for good eats; or good service. [REVIEW_5] We visited once and were very disappointed in my veggie pizza and my husband's sub sandwich.  The tomato sauce was not tasty; and they did not use enough cheese on my pizza.  The dough looked and tasted like it was prepared by a machine.  Perhaps they have improved; but we are not in any rush to try a second time.,2
92,"[REVIEW_1] Once again do not ever; for any reason; shop at Mattress Firm....after reading my review Mattress Firm commented on it; apologizing and asked me to contact them so they could make it right. I immediately contacted them and of course have not heard back after over a week. This company has no desire to make anything right. As I said in my first review not only do they have an ""F"" with the BBB; take a look at all their reviews on the internet. PLEASE spend your hard earned money with a company that deserves it. [REVIEW_2] Best pizza in Saint Louis. Whenever my family wants pizza; we always go to Dewey's. Great service; delicious salads; beer selections and plenty of seating. I recommend the Bronx Bomber and the Southwest BBQ Chicken. [REVIEW_3] This is our favorite Italian restaurant by far. The service is always good and the food is always delicious. My husband and I have tried several different plates and they have all been very good. The building doesn't look like much from the outside; but it's pretty nice on the inside. Their cheesecake is pretty amazing too! [REVIEW_4] I'm from out of town and picked up an awful sinus infection. I neeeeeded hot and sour soup. I got broth with some vegetables and about 2 ounces of corse ground pepper. It was awful. I ordered for my son and husband and their food was awful. The crab Rangoon was burnt.  Three entrees; 1 pint hot and sour soup and one order crab Rangoon. It was almost 60 bucks for tiny boxes of food. [REVIEW_5] We had already spend a long while walking around through the parade and wanted to kill time before we got oysters. We were waiting for the line to die down at two other places but came across Creole House on the way to French quarter. The line was short and it was only a 20 minute wait. I am an oyster fiend. Living in NYC I got oysters every other night enjoying 2-3 dozens by myself. Thinking the oysters would be delicious ; I ordered 2 dozens and so did my sister. We also shared a cup of gumbo. My sisters friend had a shrimp po boy with fries. After half a dozen oysters I started to feel nauseous. I didn't want to waste any oysters so I suffered though the first dozen. My sister has a strong stomach and finish 1.5 dozen. I couldn't eat anymore. The gumbo was terrible. It had no flavor; it was so tiny for 7 dollars(we had way better gumbo at another place the day after for way less). We had a taste of the po boy as well. It was just ok. My sisters friend didn't finish it either. The fries came fresh out the freezer I'm sure. Dry and scrawny little things. Should've just gone to French quarter and ate at one of the other places. Probably would've been better since the lines were longer. Would've been worth the wait. What a waste of money. And stomach space.",2
93,[REVIEW_1] Great little place for HH! Oysters are HUGE! Service was great and the drinks delicious. [REVIEW_2] So happy I found a bomb local sushi place!! Always ignored this shop going to domino's but I'm so glad I popped in. Will be coming here more than I should from now on. I got this sushiya roll and I was more than pleased! The salmon tasted fresh and the miso was on point. 10/10 recommend this spot. [REVIEW_3] Just got a pedi so I can't speak to the massage but my pedi was amazing. Place is clean and very nice; I did not have to wait at all and most importantly they know their stuff. [REVIEW_4] Maybe it's cool but the asshole out behind the X-ray machine; total misogynist; made a huge deal about the pocket knife in my purse and kicked us out even though I offered nicely to have him keep it up front with him. Thanks for proving yet again that America is made of disagreeable; awfully small people. This economy is as much of a wreck as this museum. [REVIEW_5] They carry a lot of stuff . Seems pretty organized. Staff seems knowledgable. Nice and clean.,4
94,"[REVIEW_1] I've been a Bargain Thrift fan since the age of 14 and I've never left empty-handed. Top-notch vintage and less expensive than the thrift shops in Center City of course. Through all of their transitions; from the one location to the next (both next door to each other) their selections have never faltered. I've always enjoyed the volunteer LaSalle students who are young and fresh and share a passion for second hand items although they can be competition on those hard to find ""hip"" items you may have your eye on (I think they are volunteers; not sure). Always a decent tag sale going on; in which they offer 1/2 off on a certain items having that same color tag. No doubt the $1 store further down is a true gem but I tend to find more at the regular priced location. Another point worth mentioning is that the plus sized crowd is sure to find handfuls of decent wares as well which is something I've heard friends criticize other thrift stores for falling short on. [REVIEW_2] Really good; really authentic! This is some of the BEST Mexican cuisine I've tasted since my nana cooked for me; I'm from California so I would know. The enchiladas w/mole are awesome and the carne asada tacos remind me of Rosarito Beach; yummy! [REVIEW_3] I've been a customer for well over 30 years now. This is a great place to enjoy live entertainment along with beautiful views and of course very good food. Stop by this location at sunset and see what I mean. I'm sure you will enjoy as much as we have over many years. [REVIEW_4] Came for the first time today with family and Bailey was excellent; she was friendly and attentive and THE FOOD was incredible. We had the hummus plate (which was very generous portion); the pretzels; mozzarella sticks and caprese salad. Everything was fresh and I was impressed with the food as I had never been here before. We will be back!! [REVIEW_5] The service was great; the server was pleasant and refilled our drinks frequently. Any good southerner knows keeping that sweet tea coming is a must on a warm summer day! The sampler platter was a great way to see the flavors of the chef's special dishes. It comes with gumbo; étouffée; and jambalaya pasta. The chicken piccata was good as well. The desserts looked great but we were too full to eat them. Next time I'll have to save room though.",5
95,[REVIEW_1] Has great cocktails and the atmosphere is spot on music and all....very laid back and chill if you want to get away from all the craziness from all the tourist. [REVIEW_2] Definitely try the  beef yakamein. Delicious. Super savory; simple. I wish I had the recipe. A great soup; any time of day. [REVIEW_3] Awesome service and really great food. Split a samosa chat and bhel puri chat with a friend; on Hassan's recommendation. Both were great and tasted surprisingly different.   I went in around 5 PM on a Saturday; so there was no crowd. Definitely going to be coming back again; no question. [REVIEW_4] Great Food; Great Service. Best fast food restaurant in West Nashville. The store is always clean and the team is friendly. [REVIEW_5] Super fast delivery. We order at least once a week and it takes 15 minutes. I like that you can get any sandwich as an unwich. Love the pickles and that they quarter them.,5
96,"[REVIEW_1] We had a great time at the pool a few weeks ago.  Dylan; the young man working at the pool; was very attentive to us. He got us towels and searched for 2 empty spots for us! [REVIEW_2] If you are looking for a lush and lavish place to have tacos look somewhere else. Most likely that place will also be more show than quality food. Taqueria Pico De Gallo is a little place with fantastic food! Love the carmelos; carne asada tacos; and fruit! This place is always consistent unlike some other ""famous"" taco shops around town. Head down on south sixth for a quick; cheap; incredibly good bit! [REVIEW_3] Who would have known! Food here is delicious. Can't really go wrong. Specials like chicken and waffles are always a nice surprise too. Definitely a unique and fresh menu for a ""department store"". Staff is friendly; can get crowded on weekends but they provide you with a buzzer so you can shop while you wait for your table. Unfortunately; deserts are amazing too! Be hungry. [REVIEW_4] Exceptional entrees; exceptional service.....and many very healthful options. One of our favorite local venues. Recommended without reservation. [REVIEW_5] What a great find in Meridian! I walked in and was greeted instantly! The customer service was amazing. They helped me pick out just the right things! Can't wait to go back again! Will be my new go to boutique for clothes and gifts!",5
97,"[REVIEW_1] Think twice before renting from Event Rental -- they regularly and knowingly overcharge their customers. Make sure you know exactly what services are being performed; and pay close attention to your bill. Their business policy and practice is to fraudulently charge customers for work not performed whenever there are back to back events.  Long story relatively short: tents were rented three days in a row at a venue for three separate parties (one day for each party). Mine was the middle day (Saturday). I was charged almost $250 (a third of my total cost; which they make you pay upfront) for delivery and ""after-hours"" pickup (labor fees) for my Saturday event at a venue; even though I realized about a week after my event that the same tents were standing on both the day before (Friday day and through the night) and the day after (the tents stayed standing through Saturday night and through Sunday morning). So basically; they set up the tents on Friday; left them up through the weekend until sometime on Sunday; and then charged each of the three parties separately for the full cost of delivery/pickup labor. After many attempts to call and speak to a manager and never receiving a call back; I was told there was nothing they could do about it -- one employee even stated explicitly that it is the company's standard procedure to charge each separate client for the full price of delivery and pickup; even if only one delivery and one pickup each are performed for a weekend consisting of three different events. So after many days of no return calls and no communication from upper management or any admission of wrongdoing; I had to file a claim with my credit card company.  It's clearly a dishonest way of conducting business (""scam"" is the correct word); and when I confronted them about it in a respectful manner; they refused to admit any wrongdoing and ignored the issue until I got the credit card company involved. [REVIEW_2] Good coffee; super cute location; and some of the best service anywhere. I haven't eaten there yet; but I'm sure I will be back to try the food in the next few days. The barista Kayla (I don't know if the spelling is correct) was super friendly; and she took a bunch of time to recommend other places in the area. [REVIEW_3] Food is good; however if your attitude stinks I refuse to give you a good review. We've been here before while visiting PHilly we were in Delaware and decided to drive to Philly. Only to be greeted by someone who appeared to be having a bad start to the new year. Hope you have a great new year. [REVIEW_4] I love this place more and more each time I come.  Last night I tried; finally; one of the press boxes: the Montecito.   OMG. Lobster; crab meat; bits of caviar with this lobster sauce and other gorgeous ; colorful sauces in the plate.   This is not even fine dining sushi. It's artwork you eat.   Worth the waits though last night no one outside at 8 PM. Still about 10-15 before we got a table but who cares?   This place is my favorite sushi in ALL of America. [REVIEW_5] My hair is very thin and it is hard to find anyone to put the micro beads in my hair tight enough and the weave bar are far most the best ones so far and if a few get loose I just go in and they do it for me. I love my extentions and I am glad I found them!!! My daughter loves them as well...she comes all they way from Kutztown!!",3
98,[REVIEW_1] I came here for a Sunday lunch. Didn't expect much; since it always seems touristy. If you want reheated frozen food; this is your place. Decor is not good; food is not good. Boo. Bathroom was clean. That's earns it A star.  Poor tourists! If they come to Philly and come here; they are getting a very poor representation of what Philly has to offer in dining. Very poor; indeed! Take a picture of the mural and keep walking. There are many; many better places on South St. and around the corners on 2nd; 3rd; and 4th streets. [REVIEW_2] This place is AMAZING!! I literally think I died and went to heaven. Can't wait to go back! ( definitely recommend the juices; the smoothies; the vegan curry wrap; and the kale salad) mmmmmmmmm!! [REVIEW_3] Best pizza in Saint Louis. Whenever my family wants pizza; we always go to Dewey's. Great service; delicious salads; beer selections and plenty of seating. I recommend the Bronx Bomber and the Southwest BBQ Chicken. [REVIEW_4] Not many places are willing to accommodate dogs that can't place nice with others. They give her special one on one playtime (or with her buddy when I had two that played well).   Also very few places offer the extended hours; even weekends; and especially without charging for the entire day. Worth the extra price to know she's been attended to; not just fed and crated like at the vet. [REVIEW_5] Great place to grab amazing sliders; cheese fries and wonderful donuts. I had a BLT slider...pork heaven. Cheese fries are a must.  Comes with friends that like to share because it is too hard to pick just one donut.,4
99,"[REVIEW_1] This place is a delight for all the senses. Super cute and trendy; with tasty plates. A little on the pricier side; but they're always jam packed; they're worth it. I splurged for the ""lox and cream cheese on a bagel"" which they call ""pastrami salmon with whipped cream cheese and fried capers"". Fancy schmancy. Comes with micro greens on a wheat bagel. And it's delightful! Not an everyday food at $14; but a nice treat.   Tea latte for $5; but again - a great treat and worth the occasional splurge. [REVIEW_2] I really can't say enough about this place;  the food only seems to increase in flavor as they get to know me as a personal customer. I appreciate this so much and the professionalism that goes behind their customer service.I would tOtally recommend this place as your next Italian order! [REVIEW_3] Worst experience ever!!!!   I stood in line today for 1 hour and 20 minutes for 1 shot. They the walked up in front of me and closed the line. Told me they were done and leaving. There were 60 people behind me outraged as well. F*** this place [REVIEW_4] Absolutely the best Chinese buffet in the state of Indiana! Always fresh and friendly. Great selection of food and desserts. Location is tucked away in a corner of a strip mall. Could use a face lift but don't change it by the appearance. Best stuffed mushrooms! [REVIEW_5] I have known Breakthrough Training and Jeffrey Benjamin for more than 20 years.  His reputation for providing solid team building and leadership training is outstanding.   Jeffrey is a professional who has helped to achieve my strategic business goals.  I have personally witnessed his ability to work through difficult issues with team members to gain positive results.    Jeffrey is conscientious and works closely with his customers to achieve results.    I highly recommend Jeffrey Benjamin and Breakthrough Training to all organizations seeking to reach their full potential.",4
