0,"[REVIEW_1] worst dealer by far stay clear of this place brought my van in for servicethe tech 35602 has made me wast lots of money and time after all the worst he has done i have the same issues he just had me replace my engine for nothing it still broken and my old engine was fine low milage ran great i took a chance but feel as if this guy is just throwing parts at my van rather then properly diagnostic time save your money go to falcony in speed way   update found techs name is josh like mine haha but stay clear of him [REVIEW_2] Okay; I'm obsessed with the chocolate pancakes from IHOP but they are not worth it when the service is SHIT. My server comes to the table asked me what I wanted to order for a drink; I ask a few questions about the mimosas. He said ""No just Orange juice and Champagne"" I say then I'll getting something else AND HE WALKED AWAY BEFORE I COULD FINISH MY SENTENCE. I was appalled. This man was older so he had no excuse for his ignorance. I am so disappointed with this establishment. If I could give negative stars I would. Do not go here; it is not worth it. [REVIEW_3] I have been to this restaurant three times now.  The first time the service wasn't great but the food was really good.  The second time the food was still very good but half of the food came out about 15 min before everyone else's food after an already long wait.  This last time was the worst experience I have had thus far.  I ordered food to go and they said it would be 15-20 min.  The food took 45 minutes. They left out my guacamole and a chicken taco.  I also ordered the steak and bean quesadilla which had no beans on it; no lettuce; sour cream; pico or guacamole; and also had a hair in it.  When I called to complain the manager was unapologetic and only offered a refund if I was willing to ""take the food back"" when I was already across town.  I did not expect a full refund but the least they could do is apologize and offer to refund the quesadilla and the guacamole and chicken taco that were left out of the order. I was mostly upset by the fact that I wanted to love this place.  I really tried but I will not be back. [REVIEW_4] WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!! Originally ordered rolls to go; asked to double check and they yelled at us for just wanting to make sure if we had all the rolls we ordered. After we left; we found out we were missing not 2 rolls like last time; but 4!! so we called back; asked to speak with the owner. We got on the phone supposedly with their manager; and the manager said he would give us a gift card for next time we came. Don't you think I should get my food that I already paid for? why do I have to wait til next time to get reimbursed for what I should have already gotten. The ""manager"" said the owner wasn't there but later when we asked if we could talk to him; the same ""manager"" turned into the owner. Then the ""Manger/owner"" hung up on us for trying to figure out how to fix the situation. I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN. You do not get all of what you order; and best believe I will let everyone in  the Reno/Sparks area know to not eat at Sushi Minato. Unfriendly; rude; and a big rip off. I only left 1 star because there is no option for no stars. [REVIEW_5] Nice hotel; room was very nice and clean; staff nice. Reason for the one star is the elevator. DO NOT get a room by the elevator; you can hear it and it is very loud with lots of banging. Unless you like a loud thud every 20-30 seconds; do not stay here. They put us in a room by the elevator and it's impossible to sleep. [REVIEW_6] I love this place. The owner is awesome and very hands on. Everyone that works here is friendly and will talk to you. I eat here a couple times a week.   I like that they know me by name. [REVIEW_7] Went because a friend ask me to meet her there. It lived up to all the bad reviews given. It was 7pm 3 people at the bar; bartender playing on her phone & talking to her friend at the end of the bar. No hello; can I get you something? After standing at the bar for a while she finally came over. I ordered a beer which she handed me unopened. I paid and walk to the table my friend and 3 others were sitting. At about 8pm 15 very young people walked in and had an even longer wait for her to even acknowledge there presence. I was guessing for Karaoke which doesn't start till 9pm. I left at 8:30pm. I have no idea how they stay in business and certainly don't know how she makes any money. Clearly the owner is not interested in making this a place to go. I went to the Old Double D many many years ago and I bet the original owner is glad he's gone-he should have never let them keep the name. [REVIEW_8] Perfectly seasoned meatloaf. Too bad it was served cold w cold coffee. [REVIEW_9] Stood in line and were ignored. The host proceeded to seat his friends who were clearly standing behind us before asking if we had been helped. [REVIEW_10] Awful. We switched years ago to AT&T because of Charter's terrible service; surprise charges; crappy equipment and AWFUL; AWFUL; AWFUL customer service. A salesman showed up at our door the other day saying that things were better and customer service and the company had an overhaul. He promised that the Internet would be faster and better than the one we were using; saying that each device would be connected to 100mb; not every device sharing that 100mb; our cable would be the exact same and we'd have a land line on top of it all for the same price that we were paying with AT&T. Absolute crap! We had the most basic of basic channels and the Internet was MUCH slower than AT&T. We were less than 24 hours in with Charter and attempted to get things corrected. No one would work with us and offered to charge us more to have the same channels we had before. The salesman left his cell number for us to contact him should there be any problem whatsoever and he would correct it immediately. When we attempted to contact the salesman he didn't answer the first time; and anytime after that it went straight to voicemail. Back to AT&T it is. [REVIEW_11] Bad service!  We decided to eat in to take advantage of their byob option and have dinner without cleanup.  The three of us walked in and a fee of the staff members lifted their heads to look but otherwise didn't acknowledge our presence. No hi; how are doing-just a look. We seated ourselves; waited a few minutes then grabbed our own menus.  We waited a few minutes longer and still no acknowledgment; no wine glasses-nothing!  We walked out!  It's a shame because I really like their pizza... [REVIEW_12] To start off: I have never left a bad review before. It's usually not worth the effort; and if I don't like a restaurant I simply won't go back. But this place... my goodness. Easily one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had.   Ordered the Veggie Benedict; but asked if I could have it with egg whites. The server was puzzled and said that it already came with egg whites. Ok no big deal; it was strange that it wasn't listed that way on the menu but whatever. The server comes back a couple minutes later: ""It does come with normal eggs! All this time I thought poached eggs meant egg whites."" Uh; ok. A bit odd for a server at a restaurant that literally specializes in eggs; but still not an issue. She asks if I do indeed want the egg whites; and I say yes. A couple more minutes pass; and she comes back. ""Our kitchen doesn't know how to poach egg whites; so if you want them they'll have to scramble them."" What?? You poach an egg white just like you poach an egg. But whatever; I don't care that much so; ""Sure; that's fine.""  It took us a very long time to get our food. The restaurant was not busy. Empty tables; no wait.  Finally our food comes out; and what do you know it's cold. Not just room temp. Cold. We mention it to the server who proceeds to tell us it's because the restaurant doesn't use heat lamps because ""they have so many hands."" Apparently not enough hands to get the food out within a half hour; and to get it out warm.   On to the food itself. I ordered what should've been a relatively healthy; easy meal. I got a plate that was literally covered in so much oil that my bennies were swimming. We're talking greasier than the greasiest Chicago pizza; but not due to fat from sausage or cheese. Oh no. There is no reason it should've been greasy at all; since all it had was spinach; wild mushrooms; asparagus; and tomatoes. It was literally just vegetable/canola oil. Even the side salad was drowning in its oily dressing. It was to the point that my own mother commented that if it had been her food; she wouldn't have touched it. We're not picky eaters; we eat anything and everything. So I proceeded to try some of my cold; oily concoction and unsurprisingly it tasted like nothing. It was so oily that none of the flavors of the vegetables could come out; and left my mouth; lips; and even fingers shining. And the hollandaise... oh god. What should've been a nice lemony-buttery sauce was a blob with the consistency of expired box pudding. Skin and all. And it tasted like nothing I've ever had before... maybe similar to cheese wiz? The stuff in a can? Yeah.   With all of the other brunch places around (Wild Eggs; Yolk; First Watch; Le Peep) there's no reason anyone should go to The Egg & I. [REVIEW_13] Really disappointed - we were told we would be on a 45 min wait and after approaching the hostess 75 min through she told us we would be the next 2 top to be seated.  15 min later she sat a couple that was waiting right next to us that came 30 min after we did.  This is the second poor experience we've had here.  I don't normally write poor reviews but the hostess was so dismissive and rude on Mother's Day of all days and made no efforts to accommodate after having us wait for 90 min total. [REVIEW_14] It's like they have the blind leading the blind here. We ordered a deluxe pizza and when we opened the box; ALL of the cheese and toppings had slid off the pizza and into the corner of the box. It was as if he carried the pizza vertically. We actually laughed out loud when we saw it. Plus our roast beef sammy was way overcooked and dry... and missing the ""everything"" we asked for (lettuce; onion; pickle; tomato; mayo).  So we called back and explained the situation and they promised to send the remake out RIGHT AWAY. lol.... another hour later we got a nice looking roast beef sammy but a pizza that was even MORE jacked! There was not a single topping even hinged on the the crust of the pizza.  We called back again laughing. I said; ""I am not even mad; I am impressed. Let me send you a text image of this pizza- it is crazy."" He apologized profusely and promised to send another; but at this point it had been 2 hours and we had drank our sodas; and eaten our wings and had dinner plans so we refused another pizza.   At this point; the gentleman offered to bring us back our ten dolllars for the pizza and we accepted. He said he'd be by shortly but it was another hour before we saw him.  Total s-show. Avoid this location altogether. I have had far superior service at the U City or Maplewood locations. YIKES [REVIEW_15] I just signed up for Yelp! because I could not find Dr. Valerie Biscardi when I searched this site looking for her.  She deserves a listing but even more so a shout out.  I left her office only 5 hours ago and already spoke to 3-4 friends about what a wonderful visit I had.  Valerie is a warm; patient; knowledgeable O.D. and I hope all her patients get the same experience I did.  I can't believe she stuck around an extra half hour helping pick out a new pair of frames for my face. [REVIEW_16] I am visiting from Chicago and stopped for dinner.  Food is VERY salty which any Thai cook will tell you is a big no no.  It is more Chinese style on stir fry's and they burned the fried rice.  Service very slow also. [REVIEW_17] Three Muses you are a gem and my favorite dinner spot in New Orleans. The wait was worth it; there's a reason why there's a wait; trust me.   The service was excellent. The atmosphere is cozy and elegant. The live music was a great addition and really makes this place feel like home. The cheese plate and salads are great. Also don't skip out on dessert; I'd recommend the pana cotta! :) don't miss out on this wonderful restaurant in the heart of jazz alley. [REVIEW_18] Previously; I had rated this restaurant with four stars. However; after today's horrible experience; I can barely even give it a one star. The waitress was fine. The rest; just the worst experience I have ever had at a brunch; the absolute worst! There were seven of us who waited and waited and waited for our food while others who came in after us ordered; ate and left. After an hour and 15 minutes; one of the people in our party had to leave and cancelled her order. The waitress told us they hadn't started on any of our orders at that point. Unbelievable!!!! I told the waitress I was extremely dissatisfied with the situation snd told her to share that with the manager. Truly THE WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE.  I have no intention of ever going back there. [REVIEW_19] Tonight I was really disappointed. I called and placed a take out our about 45-1hr prior to closing. I ordered a chicken Fajita and chicken enchiladas with chips and dip. The only thing right was the chips and dip; if you count that each chip was broke then maybe not. I should have taking pics of this mess I was given but I was to upset once I drove all the way home only to realize my order was WRONG and MISSING.. had no black beans and rice or sides for my enchiladas. You could barley see any cheese. I called immediately and spoke with the manager and was told that the enchiladas would been taken off my bill. No dinner than I hung up and opened the burrito I noticed I had no fajita peppers... none just rice beans and chicken..  I immediately called back. The manager agreed that the orders were wrong and she apologized and asked if I was close she would have the order remade; and take the entire order off my bill. Since I was feeding more than myself; I decided that I would return for the remade order so my teenager would eat tonight as planned. Well.. I drive 10 minutes back and get my remade order and another apology. The worse part about this is I should have cut my losses... but this is the same place that I hosted by friends Bridal shower in the private dining hall and the service was amazing; this is the same place that I have come for happy hours but tonight I should have said NO!! Get home and bam.. burrito smelled great looked great but NO Chicken.. NONE.. just beans; peppers; rice and cheese even tasted the cilantro but Where is the Chicken?? I didn't bother to call back this time. I'm gonna just cut my losses and not go back. Not a good feeling when you really want something tasty to get and get turned off Twice!! My nephew agrees.. he just went to Wendy's. Now I hope my refund is correct. Seems likely the next problem. [REVIEW_20] F*** this place I will never come back here; the people told me to pay before they did my manicure; I mean I know not many black males or males in general come in to get these things done; but dam. [REVIEW_21] Found this place online as I am traveling across country with my dog. I was assured it was dog friendly and that they would do ""and and everything to accomodate my dog."" I dont expect much. I walked in the front entrance and had 2 servers walk within inches of me by the door and look at me as if i was in the way. I walked to the bar and a really friendly brunette bartender was super friendly. Thats the only high point. The server made it clear that we were a burden; 6 different staff members watched me wait for what i thought was a single person bathroom which turned out to be a 6 stall room. I even asked and they told me to wait. Ive worked in F&B for 16 years. I would fire the entire staff minus the one bartender (black hair; rasta tattoo on her shoulder; rasta necklace on; she was cool.) and get this place in shape. what a shame......not to mention the rare tuna panini was beyond well done; nothing like a canned tuna panini and shitty; rude service. [REVIEW_22] The worst sushi I have ever had. Huge pieces and weird rolls. Tried Bloomingdales role and the other roll that they recommend. Can't be any worse. There's potatoes or something with the roll. Weirdest event had. Strongly not recommend. Don't know how they got such a high review. [REVIEW_23] Things that make for a great date night: A beautiful date Reservations at a new dinner place Getting dressed up Finding a babysitter for the night Having good conversation   Things that kill any date night (and entire weekend): FOOD POISONING    My wife and I were so excited for our date night. I had made arrangements for someone to watch our daughter so we can have a fun evening as a couple. We love to try new places and after a little search; I found Taverna on groupon. The menu sounded wonderful and with it being in Broadripple; I thought this would be perfect opportunity to go to the Corner Wine Bar afterward.     This place is a little expensive and because of that; I though the atmosphere would would have been more intimate with cozy seating and dimmed lighting. Instead; an Applebees has a more romantic setting.   We were greeted with kindness; the service was really good; and the white sangria was fantastic which would have earned this place two stars but the way the lady handled my call; telling her my wife and I got food poisoning; made me take that other star away.    We ordered one pitcher of the sangria; calamari; we each had the 8oz filet mignon wrapped in bacon - my wife's portion was larger than mine with more sauce - and lastly tart for dessert. The calamari was really good; the meat was cooked to how we like it and and the meat by itself was really good. However my wife thought the blue cheese on her filet tasted funny and scrapped it off. We both love blue cheese too.   After our meals we got our dessert. It tasted awful and we could not finish it. However we were polite and didn't say anything. Now; if I was the server; I would have asked if anything was wrong with it because we only ate a couple bites and we didn't want the rest to take home. Oh well; the total damage was more than $100 but we had a groupon; taking a huge chunk of it away.   We sat at our table for a few more minutes after they cleared it and discussed going to our next location. Unfortunately; we didn't make it. Once we got into the car; we had to go home and it quickly went downhill.    I called the place on Saturday to tell them about our Friday night experience. The lady said that no one else had complained about their food; no one else got food poisoning and then acted like she didn't care. She didn't even say sorry.    Because this place has only been open for a little over a year and pricey; I would have expected someone to have handled this in a little nicer way. Having a child and dealing with food poisoning kills not only a date night; but an entire weekend.   On a positive note; I'm sure I lost a pound or two of my 'winter' weight - thanks Taverna. [REVIEW_24] Their lunch buffet is to die for! They have many dishes that aren't on the regular menu. But if you write down the name; they can make it for you special next time you come in. I never knew I love Indian food so much before I came here.  The Carrot hawalla ( spelling?) is incredible. And the prices are excellent. We eat here at least 3 times a month. Look for them on groupon and buy as many as you can. By far my favorite restaurant. [REVIEW_25] Well. It used to be great. But The service has changed.  The last two times we ate there; service was not good at all.  Undercooked fish.  Watery macaroni. Cold onion rings.  Very disappointing.  We stayed away for a few months then tried again.  This time service was poor; prices raised; and smaller portions.  Sorry top hog.  That's it for our group.  Won't be back. [REVIEW_26] This is the most inefficient operation I've ever seen. We waited in line for over an hour and the women working the desk were very rude. [REVIEW_27] It is no longer Precision Kia. It is now owned by Fuccillo Kia. You hear all the radio and TV commercials. Let me say after being there for over 3 hours on a Sunday in the heat sucked. And to walk away without a car totally sucked. Totally disappointment. [REVIEW_28] Loved this place! I have never been to an ice cream parlor in which they had Sweetened Condensed Milk as a drizzle! Ever since I was little; my dad got me on putting condensed milk on fruits; cake; crackers and smoothies. I didn't think anyone else knew about this until I came here! I just HAD to get it on my ice cream so I chose the strawberry shortcake with the toppings of graham crackers; whipped cream and strawberries. With of course the condensed milk as my drizzle all for $7. Can't beat that. Employees wore gloves and everything looked clean. Delicious will be coming back and bringing my dad lol. [REVIEW_29] Both times we have come to this location the service is remarkably slow during non peak hours. the employees don't seem to listen when we order. For example I had to tell one person my order 3 times and when I repeated myself they seemed like I was imposing on them. The food is standard for Wendy's but the customer service is terrible. I won't go back which is rather unfortunate because it's just down the street. [REVIEW_30] The atmosphere was very trendy and hip; food was very well prepared; dishes were on the small side; staff was extremely knowledgeable. This is a new hotspot in S. Tampa. The food was decently priced; very reasonable for the quality.   I had the Prime Sirloin. It was prepared beautifully. Meat was very tender and delicious. Also had the meatballs as a side; probably the best meatballs I had ever eaten; only downfall was you only get 3. The bread was fresh baked and delicious as well.",6
1,"[REVIEW_1] Great service; great food; and great drinks. Found this gem on yelp and glad to say the reviews were right. Good quality Caribbean food in the ""south."" Will be back; without a doubt :-) [REVIEW_2] NOT KID FRIENDLY!  Came here tonight with my toddler and newborn and was joined by a few sets of parent friends with their young children. The staff was nice; but the clientele were not welcoming to children and made rude comments. Let's just say that a scene ensued and we showed ourselves out of this unwelcoming establishment.  The beer is average as far as breweries in the city are concerned. There's plenty of options with better beer; better vibes; better clientele; and way better suited for families trying to have fun with their kids.  We regularly visit the breweries of New Orleans and decided to try this place out for the sake of trying them all. We can say with certainty that they will never see our business or the business of our friends again due to the way their clientele treat families with children.  If you want Kid friendly; go to: URBAN SOUTH; SECOND LINE; PARLEAUXS - All have a great selection of beer; great staff; great space for you and your kids to have fun; amazing customers; and great food options daily. [REVIEW_3] Over priced drinks; mixing 4 or 5 different liquors and adding juice should NOT cost 15.00; and its not top shelf liquor either.  2 crab clusters and 2 pieces of corn should NOT cost 25.00! It's a shame since I live right up the street; I keep trying to give this place a chance; but every time I leave disappointed. I'm not even going to speak on the horrible parking. ..this place sucks ass ! [REVIEW_4] Terrible service.  I ordered take out and after 25 minutes I had to cancel my order.  I got my money back but what the hell?  It wasn't even busy.  I was watching them as the food came out of the kitchen and neither the kitchen staff nor the people serving had any idea what was going on.  Everyone looked clueless.  I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised that my food never appeared. [REVIEW_5] I have sears home warranty; and they offer a free annual heating and cooling preventative maintenance check. I called sears; they gave me a confirmation number to call EMCO with. EMCO promptly made an appointment for me on a Saturday. While they did offer the 3 hours window; he showed up right on time at 9 am.   The serviceman was non judgemental; as I had no clue about maintenance of my oil heater. He immediate gave me a long lesson; and showed me everything I needed to know and all the time frames of when things needed to be checked. I had a yellow leak; that turned out to be the chimney not having sealant among other items. He told me the price; which was fair considering I had only had the furnace looked at once since I moved in 5 yrs ago. I made appt a few weeks later for another Saturday to have the work completed. Window as 9 to 11. They called at 945 letting me know they had to reschedule due to illness.  I was unhappy but ok with that. I scheduled for the following Tuesday from 3 to 5.  The setter called me at 345 Tuesday to reschedule again...Not happy.  I voiced my dismay as I took off again from work to meet this window. She said she'd check and call back. Well; I thought the worst; but they surprised me. They showed up at 5 without the call back; and he had a few guys with him. Each were finishing their different jobs from all cross the city; chose to work late to help me with my house. They came; they saw; they completed the work and my heat was on and I felt secure and safe. And even before the last guy left; who was the initial gentleman from the maintenance check; he went over EVERYTHING with me on the maintenance They also were very clean; there was no dirt or oil anywhere; and they still vacuumed the heater room prior to leaving.  This is a reputable company; I am am soooo happy with the service! [REVIEW_6] If I could give this establishment less than one star; I would. Over two hours for an appetizer at the bar 2 1/2 hours for 4 out of 6 people to get the food they ordered for lunch. Brutal - oh; and the bathroom was disgusting. I appreciate if your employees don't show up so half of the menu is off the table immediately but tell your customers if you can't deliver any food - and the owner did nothing to make it right in the end - other than to give a half-assed apology - not impressed [REVIEW_7] Everyone with bad reviews needs to know this place is a bistro. Service was great; friendly; and entertaining. We enjoyed the bacon sampler; which was amazing. had the bacon cappuccino which was different but good! Recommend this to my fello baconeers! [REVIEW_8] This is one of our favorite spots in Nashville.  It has recently been remodeled and looks great!  The patio can get loud; but other than that no complaints. [REVIEW_9] This place made me want to move to Boise. Everyone was very friendly; and the space is beyond cool. Also a great selection of beers from the NW. [REVIEW_10] Started with a few drinks. Nice custom cocktail selection. Waitress was real nice and went through the menu with us. It's almost all shared plates. Very trendy; cool concept rarely pulled off well. Started with buffalo pork belly and meatballs. Pork belly was really good. Good; spicy and fatty ( you have to be into that thing). Meatballs were excellent. The only thing I would have wanted were toast points or crustinis to dip in the left over sauce. The margarita pizza was awesome wood fired; thin sauce (which I believe belongs on a pizza) and a doughy thin crust. Finished up with some vanilla and Nutella gelato. Great meal! We'll be back! [REVIEW_11] Excellent service at this port of subs. Line gets extremely long on the weekends but it moves quickly. Always fresh and yummy. [REVIEW_12] This is my family's go to when we eat out for Chinese. The place is not big but it's decently modern. The quantity and the quality of their food are always good. Some items on the menu might be a little pricy; but most of the items off their menu are worth the money. One only improvement I can see is maybe they should hire a couple more staff during rush hours at dinner; food can come out a little late sometimes and the staff looks overwhelmed all the time; we've had the server forgetting a dish we ordered before because they were so busy. Nevertheless; this is a great spot and by far the best Chinese food restaurant in the area. [REVIEW_13] The pizza was horrible had to send it back.. Even though we didn't get a new one they tried charging us for it even though we literally only took a bite.. The server avoided talking to us about it and we had to get her attention and she said she will talk to the manager about it and came back making it seem like they were doing us a favor. I do not recommend this place. [REVIEW_14] I yelped 'Lunch' and Ippolito's Seafood was the 2nd option with only ONE dollar sign. Despite the great rating; I was still a little nervous to try out cheap seafood. But I learned 2 things from this place:  1. It's not cheap; it's AFFORDABLE--extremely affordable.  2. In addition to their amazing and fresh produce; my favorite part about Ippolito's is the menu. SUCH a great variety of delicious seafood;  *The shrimp roll is amazing. A toasty brioche bun filled--and I mean FILLED; they don't joke around--with delicious fresh shrimp that POP in your mouth with every bite.  The salmon burger is off the hook; too + the best of Philly (their famous crab cake sandwich).  And the people that work here are super nice; too. Ask them about each menu and they give you a detailed rundown of what it is and how it's prepared.   I go here almost every day for lunch now--it's healthy; incredibly delicious; and oh; did I mention it's ridiculously affordable? [REVIEW_15] Very cute place and good food. Pear cider beer was really good the service was really good and great ambiance and the price was very reasonable [REVIEW_16] This store has the worst customer service time and time again.   This morning I went in at 11am (when they open) and there were probably four other customers browsing the store. I turned the corner and the associate looking shocked said ""we don't open until 11."" I said it is 11 and her other associate said yeah it is 11. She then said well let me check. Comes back and said no one will be at register because they're closed. (The door to the front was open)  I asked if I could buy something and she looked at me like I was dumb and said ""ya.""   I was both confused and annoyed so I left.   Three times before this the service was also terrible. [REVIEW_17] One of my very favorite places to eat.... Everything is always fresh and really tasty!  The staff is super friendly.  They make my favorite drink: almond milk; chai and vanilla.... So yummy; hot or iced!! [REVIEW_18] Food is good; but don't try to ever call in for takeout.  Every time they put you on hold and don't come back. [REVIEW_19] Mailed a poster-specifically asked the guy to tape the c ends of the poster tubes- he said he would -well the package arrived to the recipient empty-went to file claim-the owner seemed disinterested  in helping me-in fact it seemed he had no clue about anything -no urgency  in providing any customer service- it's been a month and I've been back and forth trying to get a resolution -not a one of the people seem to know anything ; follows up on the situation -I've  done everything  I've  been asked to do and provide-terrible service-im about to lose my shit - it's maddening -DO YOUR JOB-IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE [REVIEW_20] After a long drive home we were looking for a nice quiet dinner so decided to try this place. I called to reserve a tbl and was told not to worry about it because after 8:30 all guests would have been seated. To be sure; I asked the young lady if she'd like my name to hold a table but was assured we were fine and to just come in. Kitchen is open to 10pm. My date and I arrived at 9:42 and asked to be seated. There were three tables at the time and we were starving. The server reluctantly said hello; I asked for a table and she made a face followed by the infamous ""let me check with chef on that"". Needless to say; chef said no and we were turned away! I've been in the hospitality business for the better part of 20 years and this is my #1 pet peeve. It's a luxury to have guests coming in the door and the last thing you do is turn them away; especially like this. The girl even had the nerve to tell me I didn't have a reservation! I'll stop my rant here. Needless to say; I'll never go back and I'll make sure I tell all my coworkers/friends to stay away.  It's a shame because I'm sure the place is great (3 bells) but they have a loser chef with a poor attitude and that's just bush league. Nice work cheffrey. [REVIEW_21] Looks like a dinner; eats like a four star restaurant. Our server; Casey was really sweet. Had the creole bites; crab cakes; sampler dish; and bread pudding.  If I could eat another round; I would.  Went back for breakfast. I had the Creole bowl and hubby had the morning after. Love them grits. They have great coffee too. Adrienne was delightful-loved her!!! She went above and beyond. [REVIEW_22] I'm writing this review because somebody has to.  Surrey's is allegedly the best breakfast in New Orleans. Yelpers talk about it like it will change your life.  I don't understand; and I never will.  I've eaten at Surrey's three times in the past year; and each time my order has been borderline inedibly disgusting. I have eaten there with multiple dining companions; and they have all; to a man; in each instance found their own meals to be borderline inedibly disgusting. I've started to ask people I know; ""Hey; have you ever eaten at Surrey's?"" They always reply; ""I hate that place. The food is awful.""  I will offer an example. The huevos rancheros deluxe. The actual huevos rancheros base is flavorless. My over easy eggs were; in my most generous interpretation; over medium. The conservative helping of goat cheese (allegedly a main ingredient in the deluxe) was extremely low quality; smelling and tasting of goat the way very low quality goat cheese is wont to do. The lox had (surprise!) apparently been marinated in some kind of lime mixture; plus had been heated; possibly sauteed. The whole thing was *covered* in capers. Take a moment to imagine these flavor combinations. And it cost $13.   The emperor has no clothes. [REVIEW_23] By far the best place in the northeast and not over price; great show; best hibachi I've even been to. The atmosphere is amazing and everyone is so welcoming. I alway try to go here any chance I get. [REVIEW_24] Used MegaBus for the first time on May2 & 4; 2014. The only thing it has going for it is the price. The driver got lost trying to find the CalTrain station in Sacramento and drove for over one hour on the surface streets of Sacramento; wandering and looking for the station in residential areas. Passengers tried to help her with directions from smart phones; but she wans't interested in any assistance. By the time we pulled into the station over an hour late; we could smell that something was overheating. First the driver claimed it was the system to open the luggage doors; as these were not working and could not be opened to offload and reload passengers luggage. She finally got that to work; and told us we would have to wait for a hot tire to cool off. Eventually all seemed well; and we left. Within 5 minutes of getting on the freeway; the driver yanked the bus over to the side while slamming on the brakes. There was an offramp approzimately 20 feet from the front of the bus; no idea why she didn't pull off the freeway. She announced the same tire was overheating and it was not safe to take the bus to San Francisco. Then she took the offramp and parked in a shopping center. Told us it would take at least an hour for a new bus to be brought to us; plus time to unload and reload the luggage. Meanwhile; the passengers start getting off the bus to smoke; buy a soda at the convenience store; etc. The driver came unglued and ordered everyone back on the bus; no one could stand outside except the smokers that were smoking with her.And the replacement was not a megabus; no wi-fi; etc. The portapotty called a bathroom was filthy; burn your shoes if you have to use it. The trip back was slightly better; also very late and had a stop to explore a smell coming from the bus. After my experience; I will pay to fly Southwest into Oakland and take BART into the city. I have no confidence that these bus drivers could handle a real emergency while driving and did not feel safe. [REVIEW_25] Things that make for a great date night: A beautiful date Reservations at a new dinner place Getting dressed up Finding a babysitter for the night Having good conversation   Things that kill any date night (and entire weekend): FOOD POISONING    My wife and I were so excited for our date night. I had made arrangements for someone to watch our daughter so we can have a fun evening as a couple. We love to try new places and after a little search; I found Taverna on groupon. The menu sounded wonderful and with it being in Broadripple; I thought this would be perfect opportunity to go to the Corner Wine Bar afterward.     This place is a little expensive and because of that; I though the atmosphere would would have been more intimate with cozy seating and dimmed lighting. Instead; an Applebees has a more romantic setting.   We were greeted with kindness; the service was really good; and the white sangria was fantastic which would have earned this place two stars but the way the lady handled my call; telling her my wife and I got food poisoning; made me take that other star away.    We ordered one pitcher of the sangria; calamari; we each had the 8oz filet mignon wrapped in bacon - my wife's portion was larger than mine with more sauce - and lastly tart for dessert. The calamari was really good; the meat was cooked to how we like it and and the meat by itself was really good. However my wife thought the blue cheese on her filet tasted funny and scrapped it off. We both love blue cheese too.   After our meals we got our dessert. It tasted awful and we could not finish it. However we were polite and didn't say anything. Now; if I was the server; I would have asked if anything was wrong with it because we only ate a couple bites and we didn't want the rest to take home. Oh well; the total damage was more than $100 but we had a groupon; taking a huge chunk of it away.   We sat at our table for a few more minutes after they cleared it and discussed going to our next location. Unfortunately; we didn't make it. Once we got into the car; we had to go home and it quickly went downhill.    I called the place on Saturday to tell them about our Friday night experience. The lady said that no one else had complained about their food; no one else got food poisoning and then acted like she didn't care. She didn't even say sorry.    Because this place has only been open for a little over a year and pricey; I would have expected someone to have handled this in a little nicer way. Having a child and dealing with food poisoning kills not only a date night; but an entire weekend.   On a positive note; I'm sure I lost a pound or two of my 'winter' weight - thanks Taverna. [REVIEW_26] Sheesh stay far far far away. The prices are ridiculous for completely mediocre food. Wings were gummy; soup luke-warm; and fries cold. It's a chain; but damn that was bad. Do yourself a favor and go down the street to the perky instead. The price and food are way better there. [REVIEW_27] Absolutely worst Hertz location!!!! We use hertz for a large company. I will not use it again in St Louis. Carried on luggage; off plane quickly; then waited 25 minutes for a shuttle. I saw all other vendors go by 3-4 times. Ghetto rude workers. [REVIEW_28] Second visit in one week!!! Cupcakes are tasty and very reasonable. Moist and delightful. Only surprise was the price changed up on the cannoli cupcake which was a lil bit of a shock but still reasonable.   Will DEFINITELY be going again...... [REVIEW_29] I have straight hair and it turns out best if it's done with scissors . I said I want my hair to be cut with scissors down the side and blended and and she said no clippers and I said now I can go somewhere else and get a scissor cut it's fine no I do a good job was the response I got I can do it with scissors and what are you now she grabbed the clippers and cut 90% of my hair with clippers I get one and ethene clipper cut I told her specifically I get not want my hair cut with clippers I would go somewhere else if I were you to get your haircut unless you want it high and tight whether fade with clippers [REVIEW_30] This place is overrated. 4.5 stars on yelp should say something about this place. Went here for dinner with some friends and everything tastes average. The best thing  on the menu is the ca phe sua da; but really; you can get great coffee at any other place. Not to mention the atmosphere and environment. It's too small and tight thats its very uncomfortable to enjoy dinner.",14
2,"[REVIEW_1] Why did it just take over 5 minutes for me to get only a medium coffee?  Because there wasn't any coffee made in a coffee establishment; that's why. In addition; there are non-customers sitting in all of the outdoor seats and the floors and counters are sticky. I'm done with this Cosi. I'll be going to Brew Ha Ha from now on. The customer service is just too poor here. [REVIEW_2] So basically; you are going to be having a student cut your hair...  There is a ""teacher"" watching; but I don't think they are any better since the ""teacher"" messed up my cut more than the student did.  The haircuts are cheap; so if you are looking for something really affordable and want to take your chances; then go for it.  It will really all depend on how good of a student you have and how ready they are at that time to be a real stylist/barber.  My cut just so happened to turn out horribly; but I prepared myself for that since I knew what I was getting myself into.  Just prepare yourself for the same if you decide to take a chance to get a cut here.  DO NOT do it if you definitely need to get a good cut for an event or something because it can potentially turn out to be tragic! [REVIEW_3] Paid for Deluxe Services almost 2 months prior to the event and only received a basic package at best. Attempts to resolve the issue with Keith have been returned with defensive dialogue; accusatory statements and untruths. His unprofessional approach has escalated this situation to the point of being settled in court. I have never been treated so poorly by a vendor. [REVIEW_4] This is a big store and is open 24 hours; but the customer service is absolutely terrible. Cashiers have an attitude and the pharmacy is never prepared. When going through the drive through to pick up prescriptions; you will have to wait at least 15 minutes for someone to even address you and then another half an hour to pick up your prescriptions. They should not only hire more people in the pharmacy if they need help; but also change their attitudes towards customers. [REVIEW_5] Below average Chinese food priced accordingly. This is fine but the front counter lady is among the rudest I have ever dealt with. Unwelcoming and cold is putting it lightly. The House Special is fine if you're struggling with the base of Maslow's hierarchy pyramid; otherwise don't bother. [REVIEW_6] DON'T GO HERE FOR UBER. I have had the WORST buying experience of my life here. I walked into this dealership for the first time around the end of June. The sales people seemed helpful and answered my questions at first. I even came back a couple times before I made a decision on the car. On saturday July 2nd I made the deposit and was promised a car the following friday (July 8) latest. I patiently waited checking back a couple times throughout the week to get updates on the situation to make sure everything went smoothly. Not only was it extremely time consuming because they just didn't wanna help you out until your presence became an annoyance to them; they also kept lying to get me to leave; giving me deadlines they never met. They constantly told me that they would call me back and let me know but they never did. Today 12 days have past; and they still did not give me a proper response regarding the fate of the promised car. Today someone actually picked up the phone and after giving me a very unclear response about the fate of the car shut down the phone without letting me respond. Very rude. Who is going to reimburse me 9 days (taking out 3 days that they initially promised to deliver) of not being able to work? On average I lost more than a $1000 already by not being able to work and I still don't know what will happen. Forget about the money; the negative attitude and treatment you will receive here is not worth any money in the world. [REVIEW_7] Was not impressed with the store. The employee could care less I walked in and needed some questions answered and it was like I was bothering him that I was there. There are other stores so I will try to utilize the Brandon or valrico one although this one is so close to where I live. It's a shame. [REVIEW_8] Stopped in for dinner alone while taking a break from work.  Ordered wings for an appitizer and fish tacos for an entree.  The wings were over cooked and very difficult to eat.  The fish tacos were good.  The prices are thoroughly unreasonable; especially for the atmosphere and quality of food.  Frankly; don't really know how they're so busy.   Would not return. [REVIEW_9] So disappointing. Stopped by for the first time Friday night.  There were 3 people at the bar. The rest of the place was empty.  Sat down; no acknowledgement from the staff.  Went up to the bar and took a menu; still no acknowledgement from the staff.  The guy behind the bar walked right past us to get a bottle of wine for the people at the bar; still no acknowledgement.  Finally after 15 minutes of being invisible; we walked out; and still no acknowledgement. We are new to the neighborhood and are wine drinkers.  We really wanted this to be our new hangout. However; we will look for a place that wants to provide service; where we are happy to spend our money. [REVIEW_10] There were two people in front of me. A young woman was working alone that night. I watched her take the other two people's orders and make their crepes from a pile of already made crepes on the counter and not prepare them fresh as they are supposed to. She took my order and I asked for a fresh crepe made to order. She ignored me and made my crepe from her pile of previously made Crepes and I could see that she still had at least three more premade crepes yet to use. My crepe was soggy and a little gross. I watched her from the moment I stood in line till I left and she did not make one crepe for the three of us.  The next day I was at the mall to deposit a cheque so I went to the crepe works to let them know what happened the night before and get another one to take home. When I started to tell the guy what happened he cut me off and said I was wrong. He told me it was impossible and I did not see that. So I tell him that I know what I saw and it happened for three crepes not just mine. Again he tells me no I'm wrong they are not allowed to do that and so it was impossible. I told him that he was calling me a liar which is a bad thing to do to a customer and that I was there and he was not so I would know what happened. I tried logic as well explaining that the word impossible implies that there is no possible way for her to have done however anyone could make a bunch of crepes and pile them on top of each other. It's not even hard and in fact obviously she did it to cut corners and save time for herself.   For the next twenty mins he tells me that I have no idea what I am talking about; that its impossible to happen and that I'm wrong. He also has the audacity to say I'm just in a bad mood so I'm saying these things because of that. First of all this guy knows nothing about me and I was in a great mood before when I started to tell him about it I just wanted them to make sure it doesn't happen again. Now every time I come to get a crepe he asks me if I'm in a bad mood or not which makes me feel very uncomfortable. Plus when I told him that his customer service was horrible and NO ONE talks to a customer that way that wants to run a successful business he tells me the owner would treat me exactly the same way. He gave me a card supposedly with his bosses number on it but after I left a message explaining the whole thing I never heard back. That was over two weeks ago now.  I do mostly enjoy the crepes although they are NEVER made the way the example looks. It bothers me that every time I go buy one he asks me if I'm in a bad mood and makes fun of me. [REVIEW_11] Sadly I am revoking my 5 star review of Gallagher's. I went here last night and asked for their world famous nachos. Guess what; new menu. SERIOUSLY you're going to get rid of the awesome nachos?  No more frosted beer mugs plastic cups. And they also changed the prices on pitchers. PBR now $12 instead of $9. This will not stand.  I would also like to mention the place smelled like a ""radio rock festival"" or cat urine. It looks like Gallagher's is changing for their new lame clientele and they just lost a great customer. [REVIEW_12] I'm laughing at all the decent reviews for this place making fun of all the low star reviewers telling us this is Kmart and not Nordstrom. First off; last time I checked; Nordstrom does not sell toilet bowl cleaner; tissue paper; laundry detergent; etc. So you should come up with a better argument. No matter which way you look at it; this Kmart is the absolute worst. They never have anything in stock; the customer service is a joke; it's filthy; it's outdated; it's overpriced for a Kmart (I can drive down to Target in Ventura and get everything at least two dollars cheaper); and filled with absolutely unnecessary things. The only reason this Kmart is the second most successful in the country is because it is the ONLY option in the Goleta/Santa Barbara area and because kids moving to isla vista who need all new furniture and supplies do not know any better when they first move to the area. No one in their right mind should give this place more than one star. I am so EMBARRASSED and DISGUSTED that this is our only option in Santa Barbara. Someone PLEASE start a petition for Target. I am begging on hands and knees. [REVIEW_13] One of the worst customer service I have ever experienced at any Toyota service center! Twice in the past half year; I have had very poor customer service here. The first time was when I bought my car in specifically asking for an inspection of my right front tire; informing them it had been leaking air a few days ago and I had to pull over to get air pumped in. They found nothing... only 2 days later; that same tire went completely flat. I took my car to a local auto shop; and they found a huge nail stuck in the tire that would've been found if Toyota had done a careful inspection the first time.  Second experience was even worse and more shocking. I took my car in for servicing on a Saturday morning. The service person could not answer many of my questions; and when he stated that he was new; I kindly asked him how long he'd been working there (thinking that if he was so new that he didn't know a lot of info; that I'd ask another representative to help me). Out of nowhere; he yelled out in an extremely rude and angry manner;  ""That's none of your business ! ... I won't have you harrassing me..."" Everyone in the room was startled and turned around to see why he was shouting so loudly.  Perhaps he acted this way because there was no manager on duty; however; this behavior is customer service at its worst. As a person in the service industry myself (I am a physician and my patients' health; safety and satisfaction come first); I am shocked by his blatantly inappropriate and unacceptable behavior. This behavior reflects poorly on his company; and I hope nothing like this happens to any other customers in the future. I went to another shop to have my car serviced; where customers would be treated more politely and with respect. [REVIEW_14] Our sales person C.C was great she did everything she can to get me into the car; i was approved was handed the keys to the car etc. even had me put all my things from my trade in car to my new car; once we get to the finance dept. to sign the final paperwork; We were there for about 4hours that day; they tell me that they forgot to include sales tax from my lease trade in to the car I'm purchasing; which would bring my payments up to $24 per month which would bring my monthly payments to about $491 instead of the $461 we agreed on or i could pay the $930 est. now. I advise them all i could do was the amount we agreed on could not put down anything more. The next day i have Nick contact me and stated if i put down another $1;000 they could help me out; i stated  i could not; he basically told me that ""we are doing you a favor and helping you out due to your credit history; you could pay this now or later but you will have to pay the sales tax"". I felt like he was talking down to me and very unprofessional; i advised him could anything else be done since it was a error on there part; he basically stated no; and said if i could not make another $1;000 down on top of the $1;000 I' already putting down there nothing they could do; and kept saying we are bascially helping you out b/c of your credit history and just kept repeating it; when i stated i could not; he hung up the phone. This has been the worse delearship i honestly have been to; after spending 4hours on Saturday there and another 4hours on Monday.. [REVIEW_15] Horrible!!! Not only did i wait over and hour and 40 mins for delivery my order was wrong and apparently the use a cell phone as their business phone and every time I called to inform them my order was wrong the kept hitting the button to send the call to voicemail! I will never order from there again and I can't see them staying in business for very long If that's how they run their business. [REVIEW_16] I will literally never eat here because the owner/parking lot bouncer was very rude when we went to dinner on Saint Patrick's day ar Tir a Nog.. We tried to park in open parking that was sectioned off by SHORT HILLS RESTAURANT AND DELI OF CHERRY HILL NJ;  orange cones and signs (which by the way are completely illegal) and they were not respectful nice or friendly about us accidentally parking there.. They were simply jealous of the prosperous Irish pub... The man/parking lot bouncer (not sure of his name) was completely rude... Even though they closed at 9 he would not let us park there as of 8:15... We are new residents to this area and looking for new local places to enjoy BUT we will NOT EVER be enjoying this place (SHORT HILLS RESTAURANT AND DELI) since the owner(or parking lot bouncer was so rude) we will NEVER fraternize a business who stands for being rude to their neighbors and especially to their fellow business owners who pay for the parking spots just as much as they do.... Short Hills Restaurant and Deli  I'm extremely disappointed in you're neighborhood hospitality and how you treat you're neighbors!! [REVIEW_17] This use to be one of my favorite places for livers & gizzards; But now their food is too too too salty. It's like are you trying to give people high blood pressure with all that salt. Maybe corporate can initiate some changes. [REVIEW_18] This is the worst. My first time at an Econo anything. Playing nice for group purposes. We get here. They check us in like the rooms are clean. The rooms are dirty. The lady comes to clean the room because apparently they dont have any others clean or available. Go figure. So the manager comes outside to look as if we are lying about dirty rooms. It's hot as hell outside; wasps everywhere and we're standing here. I asked about other clean rooms and he (a-hole manager) (neil Patel) sarcastically states check in is at 2. It's 1:45 though. If you're going to check guest in at least make sure the rooms are clean or let them know it will be a few. So I'm standing outside in the heat as they apparently clean the room.  They took no cleaner in to clean counters; bathroom; etc. Just nasty. Then they just looked in the microwave & fridge to see if it was clean. They didn't wipe nothing. I would never stay at this filthy mofo or any Econo Lodge. Just nasty. Go w/ a big brand like Marriot; Starwood or Hilton where customer satisfaction is part of their branding scope. This -ish is for the birds and folks who need a place for a quickie.... Not even that. [REVIEW_19] Pretty good food; if you like food poisoning.  Had beef wraps last night. Pretty tasty. A little fatty. Have had diarrhea all day; and others who ate the food with had to skip class because they couldn't leave the bathroom.  When I came in to tell the manager; the staff working the cash register seemed uninterested and said they would relay the message to the manager; and then returned to using their cell phone.   A quick search on the Environmental Health Services website shows reports in the last 3 years include the following MAJOR VIOLATIONS:   11/29/2016 Rodents; insects; birds or animals Hot and cold holding temperatures Hands clean and properly washed; proper glove use Food contact surfaces: clean and sanitized  02/10/2015  Hot and cold holding temperatures Food contact surfaces: clean and sanitized  03/05/2014  Adequate handwashing facilities available and accessible Food contact surfaces: clean and sanitized Hot and cold holding temperatures   I urge anyone to reconsider if they decide to eat at this restaurant. [REVIEW_20] If you're a Latino; you're best staying away from this place. The lady that cut my hair was rude and very unprofessional. [REVIEW_21] This establishment is truly the worst. (And I'm not just saying this to fit in with the 50 other 1-star reviews.)  For starters; the owner is an absolute jerk off who has no problem getting wasted in the bar and kicking you out if you disagree with him. I've seen it happen at least twice. They should bite the bullet and place a sign over the door stating that differing opinions are not welcome.   I've also been privy to him taking advantage of drunk people and telling the bartender to add drinks to the tab that weren't ordered or that were ""on the house"" for other people.   Then there is the ""manager."" I can't count how many times I've seen him berate paying customers; get into loud; heated arguments; and throw people out.   And let's not forget the aforementioned bottled water debacle.   I'm not sure how or why this place stays open through Nashville's boom. I would come fairly regularly for a while to give it a chance but I eventuslly couldn't do it anymore.   I certainly hope this is not the impression of Tennesseans tourists leave with. [REVIEW_22] Used to come here while on business to the city. Dive bars are hip. Not this one. This one is just a mess. Bugs; I mean COCKROACHES; crawl along the bar and into people's coats (I overheard). I have seen the roaches and had a few crawl onto my hand. In the men's bathroom there's just a trash bag taped on the wall where a urinal used to be.  I have also overheard that 3 female employees have quit. Which makes it seem like it's not a safe place for ladies.  The bartender I encountered seemed very overwhelmed and perturbed with serving customers that weren't  friends and that weren't doing shots of cheap liquor. Bartender was also playing obnoxious hip hop too loud and denied access to the jukebox that clearly was just paused; not ""broken""; like he poorly tried to explain. I believe ownership or management changed since the last time I visited. Definitely not what it used to be. [REVIEW_23] I talked with the owner today and he said ""that does not sound like Marge."" Marge has been rude to a lot of people and they are afraid to tell the owner but I am not afraid to tell the owner. All the owner wants to do is talk to Marge. She will never change her attitude. All she does is pull the wool over the owners eyes. She even does friends laundry while at work and takes their money but does not log it as worked. [REVIEW_24] I am writing this based on the concert/bar only.  We went to the Eddie Money concert and chose the General Admission tickets.  The VIP seats appeared to be very well placed for viewing.  Unless you arrive at least an hour early and wait at the rail constantly; or you are well over 6 ft; you will have a hard time seeing anything.  The stage is raised above the VIP crowd nicely; but appears to be level with the G/A crowd.  This leaves over 90% of the General Admission patron with a very 'limited view'.  I am 5' 11"" and could see the band from the neck up about 60% of the time.  I would guess that men under 5' 10"" and almost every woman not in the front spent most of the show watching on a screen to the side that had the resolution of a pizza parlor. The wait staff was understaffed and less than efficient.  The security staff was just down right RUDE.  The sound was nice.  Eddie Money was great.  But in the non-VIP area; the concert layout and the service left much to be desired. It might not be fair that a concert rating affects the restaurant rating; but if you choose to have concerts in your restaurant... [REVIEW_25] Terrible service under new ownership.  Old clientele are ignored while customers from owners previous job are given top notch attention.   Food quality has gone down and prep errors up.  Can no longer justify spending money here.  Queso fundido ordered with jalepenos and you get none.  If you order flour tortillas you get corn.  Dirty beer glasses. [REVIEW_26] Biggest group of Dunkin Donuts idiots I have ever come across in my life!! [REVIEW_27] Not worth the 50% off. I knew I had a bad feeling the second I walked in. The restaurant was a bit too hot for a sushi bar with fish sitting there behind the un-refrigerated glass all day. I should have listened to my gut but I made a huge mistake. I ended up getting so sick! Some of the worst sushi I have ever had; horrible service; and less than 1 star quality food. [REVIEW_28] I should have read the reviews before going here. I pass ""Tony Luke's"" on the regular SAT mornings around 12:30. So I decided to Stop in for the first time ready to have a delicious war in my mouth from a nice philly cheese steak. NOT!!!!!! [REVIEW_29] I went here today because all week I've been experiencing swelling in my wrists; neck; face; achiness and burning in my arm; and generally not feeling right. I did the usual paperwork; had to pay up front; which had I been able to pay afterwards. I probably would have left and gone to Lankenau. So; the MA who came in and asked me questions was cool; personable.... My blood pressure was insanely high; which I have never experienced before (168 over 135) and I got panicky; as the alarms and crap were dinging;... The MA definitely recognized my concern; and listened pretty well.  The Dr came in and I went  thru my list of symptoms and he totally blew me off; I  said even the fact my blood pressure was sky high wasn't a bit alarming;....He said no; I have anxiety. Made me out to be a hypochondriac; which totally isn't the case; I've fallen off rooftops and walked junk off like the queen of england. He then asks are you tired...Yeah I'm tired ; I work full time in a hospital and waitress part time; and I walk like a million miles a day; but I feel crappy now more so than usual.   He palpates my belly and asks a few more questions; then says well I think you may have mono.... But there isn't much we can do about that.... I asked if he could run an epstien barr heterophile blood test to see...He said it wasn't neccesary. Um....Ok. ""Tthere isnt much that we can do about that anyway""... Great. He says I strained my wrist. I'll get you an ace bandage....Well what about the mono possibility....ande the fact my blood pressure was insanely high....Once again he gives me this look like listen you dirty little tattooed hood rat...you have no idea what your talking about..... ""Your a perfectly healthy twenty seven year old. Your fine. You have anxiety problems; you checked off depression on your chart....."" Um. Ok. So I then wait half an hour for an ace bandage while the chick runs around bitching how they don't have any supplies; never can get anything done....(reassuring) I mean; to be fair; I probably could have gotten a better physical at my apartment considering I have a broken wheelchair;a blood pressure cuff; a buncha vacutainers; some cough syrup; and part of a trach tool kit (don't ask me and my brother work in healthcare;....and kinda hoard stuff...) So I finally get my ace bandage and ask the girl if she can take my blood pressure...SHe says she can't find a stethescope. I ask a dr passing by if he can and he pretty much laughs in my face. ""Aren't you leaving?""  Um; ok. ""why do you want your blood pressure checked?"" ""Because it was insanely high when I came in on the machine; and I was hoping a manual read would prove different"" So; in less than good humor; he pretends like he's checking my pressure (I know how to use a blood pressure cuff; he didn't set it on the right numbers or place the stethescope in the correct area....) He says  ""It's like 110 over 90. Why; do you feel ok?"" Whatta mess. For the record; my brother and boyfriend took my pressure; it's still high; and now I'm out 70 bucks and all I got was a steam punk piece of junk arm brace that I'll probably be wearing in a casket judging by these reviews. [REVIEW_30] The setting is great; has a modern feel to it. The food is pretty good some of it is a bit spicy. The reason I'm giving it such a low rating is because the waiters there are extremely rude; don't clean; and demand you tip them more after already leaving a 20% tip.",0
3,"[REVIEW_1] I purched a bed 6 months ago. It IS STILL ON THE SHOW ROOM FLOOR. It has collapsed SEVERAL times.  Now I purchased their warranty; "" someone will come out with no question and replace your furniture"". That's a lie. I went into ashley to see what I should do about this on January 22nd. They put in for a service technician to call me. 2-24-16 i spoke to someone and explained that my bed was collapsing with any movement. Without sending someone out to look at it...they sent me new rails. 3-4-16 i received the rails in the mail. 3-7-16 i called for a tech to put these rails on. They out out a ticket and said i would get a call in 24-28 hours. 3-10-16 technician called and scheduled me for their first available appointment 03-17-16. I made it known that I WOULD NOT be available until after 5pm. 3-16-16 I received a confirmation call IN SPANISH confirming my appointment date and time. I DONT SPEAK SPANISH! I called them back after work requesting someone call me back that next morning and give me the information in English. No one called 3-17-16 I called the tech company again around 10am and they said someone would be out between 11am-2  . I reminded them that I told them I am not available until after 5pm. And canceled this appointment and refused to reschedule. I GAVE GOTTEN NOTHING BUT A RUN AROUND. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM HERE! [REVIEW_2] My fiancé and I stopped by just to take a look around and see what was new. Guillermo made us feel welcome. Any question we had he had an answer for and we ended up leaving with a WeVibe Passion Play Collection Gift Set and we couldn't be happier!! Great customer service; we'll definitely be back!!! [REVIEW_3] I've been to this Chili's three times since moving to Reno a few months ago and I won't be back. Each time we've gone; we've waited to be seated with barely anyone in the restaurant and not acknowledged by the staff. When the hostess finally came up she was like a zombie and was half awake.  Our waitresses each time were different girls but both acted like they were irritated they had another table to serve. Very unfriendly and tried to rush us through the process. When we ordered we asked our waitress what the choices of sides were and she rolled her eyes and put a menu in front of us and said; ""they're listed in here"". So sorry to put you out! The chicken in my tacos was hard as a rock. When we were leaving; the hostess was at the door talking with a waitress about what they did on New Years and completely ignored us when we left. If your only job is to greet; seat; and open the door for customers; you should be fired because you couldn't handle one aspect of your job. Sorry; but if you're making your living off customers and tips; learn some customer service and get your attitude straight. [REVIEW_4] 1. Bad service - all the waitresses were congregating by the cash register. not minding the place - food came out but we weren't asked what condiments we wanted nor were we provided any eating utensils. I guess it's a self service kinda place.  2. Bad food - old cold fries - unseasoned and overcooked burger. buns weren't even  toasted.  Don't go there for food. [REVIEW_5] Smoking allowed. There; I said it.  Good equipment; lots of room for players; and a nice area for spectators.  But they allow smoking.  EDIT: Lowering to 1 star after ""Peter F."" posted his ridiculous claim that spending $22;000 on an air filter makes any difference in protecting his customers from deadly carcinogens...he should do his homework: https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/air-purifier-smoke/faq-20058555 [REVIEW_6] This place is just awful. Great atmosphere; but food is just plain bad. I've given it too many tries. Done. [REVIEW_7] I want to start off with the fact that I've been here multiple times. The first time; everything was great; it was around lunch; the service was fantastic; the food was fantastic and I decided to make it my go to diner. The second time I brought my mother and she ordered a cheese quesadilla; when it came out it was just slices of cheese ONTOP of a folded tortilla; we spoke to the manager about it who told us we were wrong about wanting to order something different. So today I decided to give this place ONE last chance. Came in with my boyfriend and kids. We ordered two Reuben's. One pastrami; one corn beef and we split them as we always have. The kids ordered typical kids meals. When our food came out the Rye was completely under toasted and the fries were not well done. As a server myself I know that the cooks don't always listen to what the ticket said. One of the kids meals was completely over cooked; and the other was under cooked! (Roasted turkey under cooked; chicken fingers over cooked) The manager/host came up to the stand (which was directly behind us) and started coughing very loudly. I turned around to make sure he was ok and he's facing my table and coughing without covering his mouth! At that point I had enough! I politely asked our waitress for a box & the check. When I went up to pay the same manager/host was there to cash me out; didn't even ask how everything was just grabbed the money out of my hand! The entire time I was there the manager/host was yelling at the busser about cleaning tables; from what I saw the busser moved very quickly and there was only one busser from what I saw so yelling at him was uncalled for especially in front of guests! He also yelled across the restaurant several times for ""Ashley"" to come get a beer for another server; instead of just walking his lazy a** the 5 feet to the table it needed to go to! And last but not least; the manager gave me and the kids a dirty look and scoffed when one of the children asked if he could go give our server her tip; which is completely uncalled for and unprofessional! I told him yes but he needed to wait until she was done at the table; which he did. He then waited for her by our table and handed her the tip and smiled. She was very polite to all 4 of us and addressed any and all concerns we had! I'd suggest my server find a job elsewhere; she was absolutely fantastic and the ONLY reason I'm even giving 1 star! I will NEVER be back unless the management changes!!!!! I have been a server for over 10 years now so I know what is expected out of servers; bussers & management and this manager was by far one of the WORST I've ever seen in any restaurant! So to the lovely server with the bandana headband; GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN! You're a great server and plenty of restaurants would be lucky to have you as a part of their company! [REVIEW_8] Just recently ate here for the first time. The hype was real. My girlfriend had the Greek Salad while I ordered the Chickpea Vegetarian Pita and they were kind enough to allow for some substitutions. The food was on point and portions were very filling and satisfying. Great staff and environment. Will definitely be back again! [REVIEW_9] This is the worst Mexican food I've ever had. The salsa definitely comes from a jar. My friend got an agave sweetened margarita for $9 and we all thought it tasted like straight agave nectar and water. The cheese on the tacos looks like Kraft cheese from a bag; and the only other topping was iceberg lettuce. You might be able to find better food at a gas station. [REVIEW_10] Wait is not worth it. Almost an hour and they don't seem to have any sense of urgency. And the air conditioning is spotty. It's a good product but I won't be back and they're lucky this is tampa and not Seattle. With this kind of wait; little seating and no air - this place would have never survived in a market with competition. They need to get a better system for serving people if they want to remain open after the new ness wears off. I won't be back and I'm willing to bet this is a lot of people's first and last visit. I wish them well though and want them to succeed. But they have to fix the air and wait times. [REVIEW_11] I've ordered twice from here and each time the medium pizzas had a five inches of crust. On one ocassion they only put my toppings on half the pizza when it was to be on the whole thing. Never again [REVIEW_12] I used to really really like going to this Hardees. I liked Hardees breakfast menu a lot.  I even came here and spent close to $30 on breakfast items for St. Patrick's day.  All of that came crashing down one Saturday afternoon when the window checker never gave my debit card back to me (as I was distracted in my vehicle) and bought $140 worth of gas.  Thankfully my bank was able to stop any further transactions before they started buying flat screens at Best Buy. I won't risk using the drive thru here again. [REVIEW_13] At approximately 5:30PM 1/29/16 my husband and I arrived at the Charlie Brown's in Springfield PA and instantly had to wait to be seated for several minutes; no host readily available and no apology upon her late arrival to seat us. Once seated; our server Mike was below satisfactory at best. Salad bar was satisfactory to almost neglected. I asked for lemon with my diet soda; none arrived. I ordered the cheeseburger meal with French fries; no ketchup or condiments offered. I had to wait until he came back in the area to ask for ketchup. The server; Mike was not attentive at all. When I asked for another diet; he never brought it and forgot that I asked. However; he also did not check on us as much as we observed that he checked on other patrons. I noticed that we were a table of color (African American); maybe this had no influence; maybe it did. I requested to speak with the manager (Jennifer-I believe). I explained my concerns and her immediate fix was to pay the tab; I informed her that this was not what my complaint was about. My  experience was that of poor service. I paid my tab and did not feel like the restaurant was at all concerned about their reputation. I was completely insulted by the wait person and lack of managerial leadership by the manager. I thought you would want to know. [REVIEW_14] If I could give this place negative 5 stars I would. Absolutely the worst steakhouse in Philadelphia. My medium rare steak came out wrong 3 times; and when I asked for the manager he told me it was my fault. I would never come here again. [REVIEW_15] Place is going downhill. They raised the prices but not on the menu.   Served cheese whiz instead of Swiss.  Had to get out money back. Staff was rude when questioned.  Just about threw our money back at us. [REVIEW_16] never get take-out from this place ever unless you want to eat your lunch at dinner time.  Not only did it take almost 2 hours to get the food delivered but we were told a half an hour after we placed the order that it was on the grill(he called back because of credit card issues.)  I will never get anything from this place again. [REVIEW_17] I placed an order online to create my own pizza.  I get a call from them minutes after I placed my order saying they are out of 3 of the toppings that I wanted on my pizza.  When I got the pizza delivered; it was not even edible because there was way too much cheese and the dough was SO thin towards the middle it would just fall apart where we couldn't even pick the pizza up.  It was a sloppy mess and we couldn't even eat it.  Very disappointing. [REVIEW_18] Terrible! Rude service; and very dirty. Floors had trash on them. The bathroom that I used had water (or some other substance) on the floor.  I was pregnant and taking the glucose tolerance test which takes a long time. I had to use the bathroom often. I was scolded for using the bathroom because the water was turned off which they apparently do during a urine drug test. I had no idea...and then I couldn't flush the toilet or wash my hands. I wasn't even offered to use another sink. Ridiculous! [REVIEW_19] Expected better with all the hype. Tastes like bland day old pizza with a rubber crust. And I watched them make it. Perhaps this ""under new management"" thing has something to do with it? [REVIEW_20] Definitely not what it used to be when it was ""Christine's twisty treat"". There's sofas outside and it's an eyesore! I also went there before for a strawberry banana smoothie and the girl working said she didn't know how to make it bc she wasn't trained. [REVIEW_21] Went here based on the high ratings and raves from people.  The entire experience was underwhelming from start to finish.  Their website which is fairly useless if you want to figure out the menu before going; you have to pick your location choice out of 3 locations and then drill down to the bottom to see the weak descriptions of their menu offering; no explanations and no price; just this      Roast Beef     Roast Beef Combo     Roast Pork     Roast Pork Combo     Baked Ham     Baked Ham Combo     Roast Turkey     Roast Turkey Combo     Broccoli Rabe     Broccoli Rabe Combo   No explanation of whats in a combo (its just where they add cheese by the way)  The table placecard (instead of menu) had a more detailed description than the website.    When I walked in; its more bar than restaurant; no big deal; but there were tables.  Since I couldnt decide and the sandwiches werent too expensive at $6.85; I got the roast beef and roast port combos.  I got my two sandwiches fast enough; but the roast beef was cold and the roast pork was hot.  Not sure how a cook (for lack of a better word) could serve 2 things at the same time with such a temperature differential; one was obviously sitting for awhile.  I asked the waitress to reheat the roast beef while I finished the roast pork; and supposedly it was reheated; since it was warmer; but it was still cold-ish compared to my roast pork I had just finished.  The waitress did offer to replace it when she inquired; but I was in a hurry and didnt really care for a hot version of this sandwich.  The sandwiches were very skimpy on meat; but they ""made up for it"" by adding too much gravy to make it overly messy and the bread was disintegrating.  The menu place card mentions the ""wet meat"" option where you get less gravy; I strongly recommend you get it that style; especially if the gravy overpower the meat and structural integrity of the sandwich. [REVIEW_22] Really poor seating management. 6:00 on a Sunday and the hostess has seated several parties of 2 at 4 tops leaving all the small tables open and no tables for larger parties. Then suggests I go eat at the bar with my minor children. [REVIEW_23] I should have known it would be a bad experience from the beginning. The chips tasted stale and the salsa tasted like ketchup. Old el paso salsa from the jar would have been better. The guacamole lacked flavor; I suggest they add some cumin. The enchiladas tasted like they had Vodka sauce on them and the onions inside tasted like they weren't cooked. The tacos had cabbage on them.  The best part of the meal was the margarita. The strawberry margarita was really good.  The gentleman collecting the plates dropped a dirty knife on my cream colored shirt. I didn't say anything; we just got the check and left. We will not be returning. [REVIEW_24] Went here for the great food I had experienced before.  After HORRIBLE service; flagging down the waitresses; & being told they were out of all drinks except alcohol & water; my friends and I left leaving cash at the table to cover our tabs but did not tip. The staff proceeded to call my boyfriend a nigger & follow my friend outside threatening to call the cops.  I was disappointed in the wait staff but their intolerance & bigotry will definitely prevent me from ever going back. [REVIEW_25] This place is atrocious. The food made me sick. My boyfriend and I got the sushi for two and nothing was fresh. At all. The service was even worse. The guy refused to split our check. So bad; we went to chick-fil-a after. Overall; do not come here unless you want to live in the bathroom for the night. [REVIEW_26] I love coming here especially today! My husband and I love coming here and sampling the fine donuts and sliders. Today we got some donuts to go (because it is so hard to pick just one or two). We got them home and the box collapsed in the middle and it was all bad for the tasty goodness that was our donuts. If you have ever had their donuts you know how sad this event was!!! So we went back to go buy replacements for our fallen donuts and we told the amazing staff what occurred. They not only gave us the donuts we ordered but gave us one on the house to replace the fallen donuts. Not only is the food amazing but the staff is too! Thank you for reinforcing my love of District Donuts!! [REVIEW_27] Went here today and it was terrible. Sam is always character which is sometimes entertaining; and the lunch special is priced nicely- but thats the only good I have to say about this place.   I ordered the california and nashville rolls (i wanted the spider roll but I guess he was out of crab; or didnt want to make it) and my friend got spicy tuna and something with shrimp. Sam totally messed up the order. The spicy tuna ended up with my california rolls but i just dove in; unaware of the mixup. I cant even handle mild salsa so when i ate the tuna; it was so hot; i almost threw up; started crying and sweating- it was an awful experience. I tried to eat a california roll but my mouth hurt so bad; i couldn't taste anything and I totally lost my appetite. We didnt even bother trying to get sam to fix the order.  It was a terrible experience all because sam didnt write any of the three seperate orders down that he took at the same time. I think i'd prefer to go to bar down Printer's Alley than back to sam's for a meal. [REVIEW_28] Terrible terrible terrible. Out of 6 meals we ordered to go; 5 had to be thrown away. We were missing half the components that were supposed to be part of the meal (no buns for our burgers; no fries that were supposed to come with it) items which were described as vegetarian came with bacon; it was just a major fail all the way around. The few components that we did try were completely flavorless. We will never go back or order from here again. Waste of time and money as I then had to go home make make dinner. [REVIEW_29] I would give this place 0 stars if I could. We went during Sunday happy hour and I specifically asked our waitress about specials and she told me brunch was over and there were no other specials. Come to find out there was a whole happy hour menu and 2 of the beers we ordered were on happy hour but we were charged full price. The waitress was not apologetic; just annoyed when I confronted her and said ""I didn't know you wanted happy hour"". I was confused because it is the first thing I asked her whenever she finally decided to greet our table.  She also rarely came to our table to check on us. Go elsewhere; there are plenty of better places in the area to eat and drink. [REVIEW_30] I really don't like giving out 1 star reviews when the food isn't completely terrible; but everything about this place is just so mediocre that I can't find a single reason why anyone should go here.  There are so many better options for less money that I wouldn't suggest that anyone actually eat here because you would be wasting your time and money on bland food.  Pros: The staff was friendly and the sriracha sauce for the fries was good.  Cons: They got my order wrong and forgot the bacon; but I don't think even bacon could have saved this burger.  Once I realized how much I had just paid for a burger and fries without bacon I was even less impressed with Bagger Dave's; if that's possible.  The burger was flavorless.  Not only are the portion sizes at the likes of Five Guys and Boogie Burger bigger; but I was amazed at how flavorless the meat was.  I'm no chef; but I can cook a better burger with Wal-mart beef.  The only thing I could really taste on the burger that stood out was the pumpkin BBQ sauce.  I just can't get over how pathetic this burger was; especially given how much I paid for it.  Words can't describe how let down and sad my taste buds were.  The fries were a little overdone and also somewhat flavorless; which is probably why you get a cup of sauce to dip them in.  They're definitely not on par with the likes of Penn Station or Five Guys when it comes to fries.  Overall I was quite dissatisfied with my meal.  I went in expecting some awesome new restaurant and all I got was something that doesn't even compare to Five Guys for a considerably higher price.  I honestly can't think of one good reason to even try this restaurant.  If you want a good burger go somewhere else.",3
4,"[REVIEW_1] The Blind Tiger is tucked in near some antique shops in Ybor City; unassuming to the eye walking by it save its awesome sign (of a blind tiger; of course) painted on the window. The interior is warm and inviting and the focus is on coffee; tea; and fresh baked goods with some clothing and homewares also for sale. What really impressed me however was that there is as much emphasis on the tea as the coffee: too often at coffeehouses tea is simply an afterthought and nothing more. Not here. There are about six selections of tea and they roughly cover the gamut of black; oolong; and green teas you'd hope to find. The coffee I had was very good and the baked goods include such favorites as banana bread; cakes; and cinnamon rolls--the latter apparently being what Blind Tiger is most known for locally.   Overall it's a very neat little place and the interior is one which makes you feel no expense was spared to create a haven from the loudness and bustle of Ybor City; where it seems every other business is a bar or club. As much as I love bars; it's great to have a place that provides a degree of quiet and serenity. [REVIEW_2] I love this place...stop whenever I can; either at this location or the Philadelphia one. I could eat the cumin style lamb every day of the week. But honestly; all of their food is good. I'm definitely a fan of their rabbit appetizer. People can argue about how authentically Sichuan it is...whatever. The only place I've actually had Sichuan food taste exactly like they serve in Sichuan Province was when I went to Chengdu. This place is well worth eating at. [REVIEW_3] If you like lobster this is the place. Great prices great service and great food. Very casual dining.  Back again to enjoy the Lobster special w 1  1/4 lb lobster;1 # mussels and 1-2# steamers with corn and potatoes for $19.99. See photo.  Clam chowder so good as is the Ucon lobster roll covered in melted butter. [REVIEW_4] Everything you want to eat and drink is here.  The wine section is extensive.  A trip to the cheese room is heavenly.  The prepared foods are delicious.  The marinara sauce is to die for.  They have hoagies and paninis made to order.   Visit the coffee bar for some serious brews.  The gelato looks and tastes very close to the real deal in Italy.    They have a covered outside seating area that is cozy yet spacious.  You can even go grocery shopping here.    What is not to like about this place?  If you like Italian food you owe it to yourself to check this place out. [REVIEW_5] Food is not bad (i.e.; standard Cosi glorified fast food).  However this particular restaurant has the rudest employees I have ever met in my life.  Asking for a fork is a huge burden on them for which I must apologize.  I am SO sorry I need a fork to eat a salad.  Also the workflow here is weird.  They act like you're a huge idiot for not knowing you order salad at one end and soup at the registers.  Signs might help.  Tomato basil was dec though. [REVIEW_6] The family run place is amazing. Great service and great food that is all cooked to order. Be aware the mild is on the spicer end; so be mindful when ordering. [REVIEW_7] After trying to talk Thai with Chef & waitress so I tried it here but come out super...disappointed :( Okay their menu has variety noodle styles to choose but not even one item that we love.  ie. we ordered (SUPER spicy) somtom came out just a plain salad on top with dipping sauce from the bottle; curry tasted suck even my white folks said so :(  Don't get me wrong; this restaurant may great for some local clients but I won't recommend you trying if you seeking for authentic Thai taste. [REVIEW_8] Great food. Definitely will continue to go there. Actually about to order from there today. Grilled cheesesteak was great but my Gf had the steak and shrimp quesadilla that was huge and real good. [REVIEW_9] Best sushi in Tampa bay! So fresh and great service; and they have an awesome lunch special. [REVIEW_10] We stayed at the Avalon for 2 days after a cruise. Everyone and everything was wonderful. We had sandwich s day one with the happy hour Daquri! Delicious...... Dessert was awesome. Great service. Next day breakfast pulled out all the stops. Later poolside with $3.00 craft beer. The pool and surrounding area are beautiful well appointed. Each and every staff member was friendly out going; suggestions on area museums and attractions. We will be back! Avalon and Hollander better than our Cruise! [REVIEW_11] I lived here for 5 yrs this is the best breakfast I've ever had in Tucson. The service was awesome too. [REVIEW_12] We stopped here as part of an Ybor Oktoberfest pub crawl on a Saturday evening. We stopped at 14 bars that day and not only was this bar a blast when we swung through the first time but it was even better when we decided to make it our night cap.   Its a medium size place with a few German touches around; dim lighting; tvs for sports and a full bar. At first entrance; the most obvious thing we noticed was the cute little blond bar owner singing ""du hast"" on the karaoke stage. Um ya; when was the last time you entered a bar and saw the owner belting out German lyrics to get the barflys pumped? My bet is you haven't.  The bartenders at Doppel Decker are fantastic. The ""what can I get you""; then not see you again till your glass is empty type of bartender is non-existent here. From the moment me and my friends sat down it was nothing but sexual innuendos and them fighting over who got to yell DAS BOOT with us next. And yes; they have the infamous boot and it is as glorious as you may think. They actually have 2 versions: Das Boot and Das Pussy Boot (this is the smaller one; but still a metric shit ton of beer and only $10). For either one of these you must yell at full volume your boot of choice before you perform the chug. For the latter boot; you must also have the anatomical part or else you'll get tore apart so bad you may start to believe there's a mangina in those ranglers.  They've also got karaoke on Saturdays which is great fun.  I don't frequent Ybor often but I may start taking special trips just to check this place out more often. See you there!! [REVIEW_13] Super nice staff; great service. Always on time and on the ball to put you at ease. Oh; and they never leave me feeling guilty or scolded when I admit I don't floss every day - just a quick word of encouragement. [REVIEW_14] Great place great lunch and even better great waitress Gail ...you made our afternoon ! [REVIEW_15] Bailey was a great piercer; very friendly and knowledgeable! Would definitely recommend coming here [REVIEW_16] Easy to get ahold of and things taken care of as a potential tenant... impossible to get things taken care of once papers are signed and they get their money. Very disappointing.  Update. Service just keeps getting worse. Unbelievable. [REVIEW_17] Been here twice now.  Both times I ordered a caesar salad with chicken; and both times it was a bust.  Some of the produce was wilted; browning and bitter; and just doused in dressing beyond anything reasonable.  Counter service was so-so.  First time I went in; there were two staff members taking their time.  I was third in line; and it took almost 20 minutes to walk out with my to-go order.  Second time I was in; there was literally no one behind the counter or anywhere in sight for almost 10 minutes.    No bueno; Fresh Bar.  Thanks anyway. [REVIEW_18] Love this fresh new spot! Sabrina is lovely and the food is diverse and delicious. We had a green coconut soup that I could've eaten an entire vat of; plus my man had a pulled pork sandwich with mouthwatering succulent meat. I had a Thai noodle salad that was huge; fresh; and perfectly seasoned. Casual; fun; and overall super yummy! [REVIEW_19] My trip to SB for my step-sisters wedding was during grad week; so i knew the rates were going to be on the higher end. Ive been shopping around and when i came across this hotel's website; it looked like a good deal considering the location; appearance and price. The rate was $160 the first night and $180 the 2nd. When my boyfriend and i arrived;i thought we were in the wrong place.. i couldnt believe THIS was where we were staying! It looked like a run down motel. The Motel 6 next door looked like a 4 star compared to this place. When my bf went to ""check in"" the guy told us its late  so we can take care of the paperwork in the morning; the rooms unlocked and the keys are inside. (wtf?) When we got inside; the room looked NOTHING like the pictures on the website. I felt like i was scammed. The lamps were the ONLY thing that the pics and actual room had in common; other then that everything from the ceiling to the carpet were different!!!! All we wanted to do was have a relaxing weekend and stay in our hotel room but after seeing the room (it just looked dirty and unkempt); we couldnt even stand being in there another minute. We noticed that they offer free wifi so we decided to start looking for rooms near by; and of course... the wifi was so bad that we couldnt even connect to the internet!! The door had a sign with crime dog Mcgruff (Mcgruff?? seriously?! i didnt know he was still around) giving some pointers on how to keep safe... a few things to mention were  - always lock doors and windows ( windows didnt even have latches) - if someone poses as an employee do not open the door  - do not draw attention to yourself such as wearing flashy jewelry; clothes etc.   We decided to leave and drive around and call to find another place... at about 2AM we finally found a place; a little bit more expensive but worth EVERY penny!!!   All in all the reason i am so upset is because of false advertisement and they still went ahead and charged us even after the fact that we had told them that we left because the rooms were nothing like what their website showed.  I will NEVER believe a website again and especially this one. [REVIEW_20] Haven't had a chance to try much of what St. Louis has to offer in Mexican since I'm fairly new here. Tried this place and won't be going anywhere else for my Mexican fix. Authentic flavors and textures makes it even better; makes me think my brother-in-law's mother is in the kitchen. Great food; good prices; excellent portion size. [REVIEW_21] This place has all you really need: hotdogs; bomb relish; and beer. Oh; and it's open late. The variety of dogs is cool; and I haven't had one that I don't like. The location is prime for late night noms. I've always had great customer service there; and speed of service is good; but not great. I heard there was new management and the last time I went I noticed faster service. Keep it up! [REVIEW_22] Wonderful place- pumpkin pie cheesecake ice cream was great!!  $7.00 for 3 people instead of $7 per person!! [REVIEW_23] Great place to eat; even with a horrible waitress the manager was there to compensate. Taking off incorrect meals off the bill as well as providing half off our future meals. Great customer service even with a shit waitress and good food a majority of the time. [REVIEW_24] Amazing Creamery -- a great selection of flavors!   I sampled a variety of flavors before I had to make the tough decision of choosing which ones to eat! My friends ended getting the awesome sampler scoops (4 flavors for $5 or 6 flavors for $7) and was able to try so many flavors! I ended up with two delicious flavors -- Red Velvet and Strawberry Sangria in a waffle cone!   The decor was super cute-- chalk boards with flavors written on there in a colorful fashion; and hand made drawings were dangled about. The fill of fresh made waffle cones also permeated the air; really riles up the sweet tooth in a person. (;  Noteworthy flavors: - Creole Cream cheese (cheesy vanilla goodness) - Champagne Violet (really good vanilla flavor with a hint of floral) - Red Velvet (cream cheese goodness with chunks of red velvet cake throughout) - Strawberry Sangria (fresh strawberry taste in sorbet form) - Pop (tastes like strawberry cream soda!) [REVIEW_25] Great location quiet and amazing room. Close to freeway and airport but can hardly hear it. Nice sitting room and huge HD tv. [REVIEW_26] Yesterday was my first visit to Paris Parker. I have never gone to a stylist that didn't come with a recommendation in my life until now. I was short on time and wanted to go somewhere near my home.  They told me I would see Stacey for my full highlight appointment.   She was awesome!  She got all the brassy color out of my hair and made my blonde look natural and vibrant.   Blonde hair isn't easy and I was expecting to have to go back a couple of times to someone new until they got it just right. I was wrong.  Stacey nailed the color and was really nice to chat with too! Also a must when hanging in a chair for hours.   Highly recommend... Although I may regret it if she gets too booked up :) [REVIEW_27] I've always liked this restaurant no matter what location I've been to. Nothing beats having a huge steamy pot of seafood; potatoes; and corn. So good! [REVIEW_28] Favorite thing about Mel's: nobody outside of Manayunk or Roxy knows about Mels. This is a TINY shack of a place that can hold maybe 15 people at a time on Umbria; which is a street with lots of older rowhomes and industrial/warehouse type buildings. Don't let the appearance put you off. It's divey; but good diners often are. It's cheap; and the food is fantastic. I get the veggie omelette (no cheese; and they have no problem accommodating requests for what goes in stuff... the cook is 5 feet from you and talks to you herself!); because the mushrooms and spinach are AMAZINGLY TASTY. I think they simmer them in wine or something.  The wait staff is super attentive and friendly; even for the neighborhood. Love; love Mel's.  There's a parking lot outside for free; and tons of street parking if that fills up. [REVIEW_29] This is an excellent learning center. The staff are friendly and truly care about the well-being and growth of each child. The outdoor play area is larger than most facilities. Music and Spanish are incorporated into their daily activities too. Monthly curriculum with different topics including science activities is also provided to parents so that we are aware of what our child is learning. Overall; this is an wonderful; family-friendly childcare facility! [REVIEW_30] One of the best hotels I've ever had the pleasure of staying in. Clean; close to the airport; tasty continental breakfast; in-room fridge; spacious rooms; comfortable beds; and the friendliest staff ever. Matthew and Ricky were awesome! I definitely know where I'll be staying if I ever return to Reno.",25
5,"[REVIEW_1] Did not care for the food; service was mediocre; and parking was dismal. [REVIEW_2] Finally open; The Livery makes use of the former IPD Horse Livery and is the newest endeavor by the Cunningham Group- the masterminds who brought Mesh; Bru Burger and Union 50 to the Mass Ave area.   Livery features an extensive tequila menu in both of their bars. Yeah; I said two bars. One downstairs and another one upstairs that overlooks a patio that's going to be pretty nice this coming spring.   Menu features small plates..  ceviche; yuca fries and jamon serrano top the appetizers with octopus; choripan and skirt steak make up the more substantial (and higher price point) items.   For my meal I went with the Livery Margarita ($9) made with maestro dobel diamante; Lazaroi triplo; fresh lime juice and agave. Add some salt to the rim and this was pretty tasty!  I also went with the roaster vegetables with chimichuri. A nice and somewhat healthy way to dine.   Valet parking is a must around here unless you happen to be lucky enough to score a parking spot out front or on Mass Ave. if walking; the door is on the north side of the building back a bit.   So happy to be neighbors with this place. My VIP card is going to get a [REVIEW_3] Truly a hidden gem. Fantastic; charming service; nice cozy atmosphere with unique and delicious home cooked food. Lots of vegetarian dishes; but we went in another direction. We started with an Ashak appetizer; an incredible lightly steamed dumpling covered with a meat; yogurt sauce.  Also tried The Bulani appetizer. It was a crunchy fried potato and onion pastry with a yogurt dip. It's a BYOB; so we brought a decent bottle of champagne and saved a lot on the bill. I ordered the Qablee Palaw which was tender marinated lamb with almonds; raisins; carrots; and rice. My wife had the lamb kabob; grilled; smoky and very tender. We finished the meal with afghan style ice cream; and baklava with two strong coffees. Perhaps the best and most affordable meal we've had in town in the last several years. [REVIEW_4] Very clean; nice staff; tasty food; generous portions and great prices.  Try it; you will like it. [REVIEW_5] Had the daily special; blackened ribeye I think it was; delicious steak; cooked and seasoned perfectly. Mashed potatoes were absolutely delicious. When I want a good steak; this would definitely be my choice. I haven't been able to find a better steak. [REVIEW_6] Best auto body shop in Philadelphia in my opinion. My Honda Fit had accumulated all sorts of nicks; dents; scratches; and even some really ugly lime deposit stains on the hood of my car. I took it to Devlin's to get touched up; and what I got back was a car that looked like it just rolled off the assembly line. Honestly; if I told you my car was 3 years old and had gone through a few scrape-ups; I don't think you'd be able to tell. Ed Devlin is a miracle worker; and he does his magic at a super affordable price... I was shocked at how inexpensive the bill came out to be. [REVIEW_7] to many changes to an awesome place has made bottle works a thing of the past for me.  removing favorites from the menu.  raising prices.  and promoting only buying local whilst not using items not produced in house as a new goal are very confusing.  sad to see this happen [REVIEW_8] On a recent trip to TN for a ""best friends"" reunion we decided; pretty spontaneously; to get matching tattoos celebrating our 15 year friendship! We didn't have any expectations about being able to get into a tattoo parlour especially one with the reputation of Black 13! However; Black 13 even though fully booked; went out of their way to accommodate us knowing 3 of us had to return to CT! In addition to cleanliness; the staff was VERY polite and Ryan did EXACTLY what we wanted! I would highly recommend Black 13 and I definitely plan to return next time I'm in the area!!!!!!!!! [REVIEW_9] We went on a Wenesday 6/6/18 @ 9:20pm  for endless wings! Everything was normal then we found a folded up receipt in our coke under the ice. I already took two sips into it! I was so shocked that they missed this. Unexceptionable I can't imagine where it came from. The only logical explanation is this is a coke from a customer that left and they folded their receipt and tossed it in their drink. Do Hooters re use their cups without washing it or tossing whatever was in it? I brought this up to our server ""savannah"" and she played it off! Stated ""wow that never happens it's usually bugs or something in it"". I don't know what type of explanation or apology that was. If I eat at a restaurant I am expecting clean and delicious food with service; I did not get it at this Hooters. [REVIEW_10] Delicious; good customer service and they place is always clean. What's not to love?! If you get a medium; you can select 2 flavors. [REVIEW_11] Food and music were both fabulous. Our large group ordered a wide variety of dishes and we were very happy with all of them. [REVIEW_12] Had the pastrami; chicken bacon ranch; and big tommys roast beef sandwich....all good! Would definitely get them again. Live music sets the ambience and it's such a chill spot. [REVIEW_13] Such an all-around great experience coming here. The service was great; the fried chicken was on point (especially if you mix the lemon-honey yogurt sauce with the hot sauce and put it on top). Also; the garage atmosphere was taken very seriously. I loved every minute of it. The raw wood; the lights; the whiskey selection; the service - really the whole shebang. Oh; did I mention the biscuits?! I will be back [REVIEW_14] I was in Santa Barbara last weekend visiting my friends who live there and I came across Backyard Bowls on Yelp. This place did not disappoint. You can it is a happening spot; hence all of the reviews and consistent business.   I give this place 5 stars because the service was quick and friendly. Also; it is definitely one of the best Pitaya (dragonfruit) Bowls I have ever had. They give generous portions and the taste is just impeccable! It includes strawberries; blueberries; bananas; a little sprinkled coconut; and granola! My friend ordered the Berry Bowl and she loved it as well. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes a healthy & delicious boost to start your day!   Next time I am in SB; I am definitely coming back. Thank you; Backyard Bowls! [REVIEW_15] This place was awesome! Even better than I expected! We ordered the Wagyu burger with a side a sweet potato fries and the the filet mignon with a side of asparagus and brussel sprouts. The burger was decently seasoned and had perfect melted cheese on top. The onion jam on top provided the perfect sweet to the burger's salt. The sweet potato fries are skinny fries and are the prettiest; brightest shade of orange I've ever seen! They had a nice texture and good seasoning.   Now; the filet mignon was incredible! It had one of the most amazing textures I've ever experienced in a steak. It also had a very strong pepper flavor that was perfect! The asparagus great and the brussel sprouts with pancetta were everything I want out of life! I will definitely visit this place again! [REVIEW_16] Great gyro and pork souvlaki. The gyro was stuffed full of very tender meat. Had the saganaki to start; which had a nice texture and mild flavor. We'd have all of these again.   Our server was attentive and very friendly. Add in the free parking and thus place is a home run. [REVIEW_17] I've been eating here when I'm in town for about 5 years and this place used to be great. The food has severely gone downhill in not only quality of ingredients but also in ability to prepare a dish. I ate here for lunch today; saying that so hopefully a member of the staff reads this and remembers me; I ordered the dry hot pot and my gf ordered fried dumplings and the cold noodles with chili oil and we shared each other's food. The mushrooms in my dish were impossible to cut even with a knife and the rest of the vegetables had a freeze dried feel to them being the consistency of bark. The pork was a bit rubbery and only had flavor from the oil draped over everything that seemed under seasoned as well and definitely tasted old. This was labeled in the menu as a 10/10 spicy rating; it was at most a 2. I didn't bother saying anything because of how rude the waiter/host was; but I'll get to that. The rice was cold and clumped together in chunks that led me to understand that it was previously microwaved. The dumplings looked ok; but the dough was undercooked and the sauce was just soy sauce that had no care whatsoever put into it. Her noodles were very bland and whoever prepared them obviously doesn't care about their food. The noodles had the same flavor deprived oil from my dish in it; just disappointing really. This type of food is supposed to be robust and I've eaten at a ton of places across the country and internationally that do care about what the put out. This place doesn't care anymore. The man that seated us was incredibly rude the entire time. He huffed and puffed and stomped his feet when I asked for the real Chinese menu instead of the Americanized Chinese menu. And; they used to throw shade if you asked for the Americanized menu; now it's the opposite. After we were done we both had a decent amount of food left and I decided to take it to feed to the raccoons that come around my house. They look cool and I like to feed them. Anyway; the take out container was dirty from previous food in it! I was blown away; especially when I pointed it out and the rude person pretending to be a man grabbed it out of my hand and stormed; literally stormed off before I was even half way through my sentence. I was calm the whole time; not sure what this guys deal is. Then came back with the same container that he washed! He washed the dirty container that should never have been used in the first place and thought that was acceptable. I will never go here again and I hope they go out of business so no one has to be punished by this Handy Nasty food. Disgusting food and disgusting people; except for the one guy who worked there who said goodbye to us. He seemed mortified because he knew what the cuck host just did to everyone in the dining area throughout the day and I assume throughout his life. I hate this place; and I can only hate it because I used to love it. [REVIEW_18] The staff was super nice and let us try some samples. It looked nice and clean in there! They have all the speciality favors out in the front and the standard flavors are in the back. I really loved my waffle cone with chocolate chip ice cream! The Cookie Monster ice cream was good too! [REVIEW_19] Went there the other night and the service was horrible. Girl behind counter yawned in my face than said ""what you want?"" Seriously? That's how you ask to take my order? Wow.. Trying not to judge the entire experience on terrible service; we tried our sundaes and were even less impressed. Our turtle sundae didn't have any caramel in it - you know -one of the main ingredients; my Christy had the worst iced brownie in it if ever tasted - total bargain basement; still frozen; so bad even a little Debbie brownie would have been a massive upgrade & the Smore was a pretty light on toppings; pretty sad excuse... Not going to waste my money here again; that's for sure! Will spend my money @ How Sweet Is This & Fritz's for now on; where I actually get what I pay for and more... [REVIEW_20] My fault for falling for the $6.99/lb filet (or maybe another cut; it was a month ago and I can't remember that specifically) and buying 2 (one for me; one for fiance).  Shame on me for not cooking it on the day I bought it; apparently.  Because when I DID go to cook it the next day (yes; that's right) it had turned brown and smelled awful.  Note that the other items in my fridge were fine (including other raw meat); so I suspect this was on its last legs when I purchased it.  Did I worry about being able to return it?  No...I go in there all the time (laziness and convenience) and in fact had been there 4 times that weekend because I was baking something and kept forgetting key ingredients.   So I went in; without my receipt; to ask if I could exchange it for a fresher piece of meat (I really had my heart set on steak).  Tito; the manager; gave me a super hard time about not having the receipt...I explained that I'm not used to having to keep the receipt in case the food I bought was SPOILED; but he didn't care.  He then proceeded to tell me that maybe it was my fridge; that I really needed to receipt; and to generally balk at my attempt to politely receive a refund or new steak.  Finally; he gave in and I got 2 new steaks; but that wasn't the end.  He stopped me to inspect them on my way out and started saying again how he thought I had either left them in my fridge; or my fridge was broken.  I commented that if I had the same issue at DiBruno Brothers; I wouldn't be put through this grief; to which he responded; ""Well; we aren't DiBruno Brothers"".  No shit.  I emailed them and commented and of course heard no response.  I really wish that the little grocery at 20th and Spruce was better stocked; because I this place blows and I don't enjoy going there.  GAH! [REVIEW_21] Al's is amazing. Had the triple play combo with pulled pork; ribs; and sausage with coleslaw; baked beans; and corn bread. It was the best bbq I've had in I don't know how long. Huge portions and Al's family were great. Deff worth the price for the quality and portions. [REVIEW_22] We went to Red Mesa Cantina 3/26/17 as a party of five. The service was outstanding; our waiter Mario was very helpful; and entertaining. The food and drinks were outstanding. Everyone enjoyed their entrees so much; that no one could pass up on deserts.....which were also delicious. We plan to return for another enjoyable meal in the very near future! [REVIEW_23] Cheerful people who know their stuff work here.  The place itself is bright and roomie.  The array of breads and pastries gives one pause.  And while I was enjoying my coffee and chocolate croissant they took an order for a flourless chocolate cake which was to have a layer of raspberry and the top was to be decorated for a birthday!  I was drooling.  The calm with which they work shows in the taste and look of every item. They are closed Monday but be sure to double check as you would not want to be disappointed. [REVIEW_24] First time paddleboarding. 3 women from the East Coast..so we were nervous. We were newbies to paddleboarding.  Grant was our instructor and he was amazing and patient and has the best Aussie accent (it's real too!). We had great instruction on the ground and safety instruction before hitting the water. We did really well and owe it all to Grant and his individual attention and not pushing us beyond our capabilities. We ventured farther out to sea where the waters were a little bumpy and we were just determined to stay standing. 2 of us fell numerous times but had the best time. Grant brought lunch from Trader Joe's. yum. we loved it. We woud recommend this company and Grant to everyone; in fact; we already have shared it with others. [REVIEW_25] I can eat sweets like no other and I've eaten them all over the world. Even at well known bakeries. And I've come to realize that I'm lucky the Flying Cupcake is here in Indy and that their cupcakes consistently make me happy. Their cupcakes are some of the best I've had and I haven't had one I didn't enjoy either. The cupcakes are large and reasonably priced. Sometimes I'm bad and I can eat a whole cupcake (sometimes two) in one sitting (#fatgirl@heart) but they're definitely large enough to share. The frosting to cupcake is at a good ratio. While I love them all; some of my favorites are the Red Velvet Elvis; Auf Wiedersehen; Pretty in Pink; and Pucker Up. They have some vegan options and seasonal cupcakes as well. If you ever get distracted by the bits and bobs they have in store; please take a moment and admire how freaking cute and adorable they are! The stores are usually clean and there are a couple small tables for you and a friend to dine in. Service has always been friendly. [REVIEW_26] I love this place. The staff is so nice and always helpful when trying to decide from the delicious menu. They let us sample sangria and a tequila wine as well. Their guac is outstanding and will never not order when I'm here. They were rated #24 I believe on the top 100 tacos in the US and for good reason. Unbelievably good. [REVIEW_27] Place is horrible. They make it look on the website like it is a made to order deli but we disappointed to find this morning that it's actually just a couple day old sandwiches in a refrigerator and a bunch of random other crap. On top of that the sandwich was ass. [REVIEW_28] when my boyfriend casually suggested we go out and rent some videos; i had to stop for a second and ask ""wait; video stores still exist? don't you have netflix?"" of course; i forgot that boyfriend is a cranky old man in training and hates technology. so; i begrudgingly agreed to go to the so-called ""video store"" -- and was pleasantly surprised!  Casa Video is awesome :) they have just about any movie you could ask for -- in DVD and VHS format (i know; who still uses VHS? oh well). They also run different promotions; such as 2 for 1 rentals on certain days; and a ""film festival"" where they list off staff picks (while i was there it was black and white movies -- very cool to see the staff members choices!)  We rented ALOT of movies while i was there -- mostly zombie movies; our favorite genre. They had ALL the obscure movies I was looking for -- including Fulchi's ""Zombi""; which i didn't see on my first lap through the shelves and was very upset that i couldn't rent it. but i was thrilled when I found it (finally!)  Staff is really nice and helpful too; they directed us to the sections where we could find weird subtitled films and exploitation films (certain horror films are considered exploitation; i guess); and even gave us free popcorn! yaay!  The only bad/weird thing is that what you see on the shelves is what they have. If it's not there; it means its rented. So; there are basically no backup copies of any movies (with the exception of new releases); so it's every movie hound for themselves.  As a bonus (for me) they had just about every B-horror movie i could dream of -- including many I had never heard of! I might have to ditch netflix for Casa Video when I move out there................maybe. [REVIEW_29] Always outstanding. This evening; they were a bit short on wait staff but Frank our waiter made up for it; after some initial delays; with extraordinary attention. An outstanding generous gin Martini followed by the smoothest imaginable vichyssoise and a distinctive duck dish; all crowned by an exemplary creme brûlée. Fabulous! Whoever edits the menu should correct the spelling of sauce bearnaise and of Riesling. [REVIEW_30] A 12 dollar burger and fries that were not even edible. Seriously; I used to enjoy this place but man has the quality taken a nose dive.",22
6,"[REVIEW_1] Had this local icon recommended to us while eating dinner nearby. The concretes were INCREDIBLE.  Enjoy! [REVIEW_2] I used Sultans last year and this year for moving and both times they were wonderful to work with! The first time I used them; they realized that my couch didn't fit through my door (after trying extensively) and they would not be able to hoist my couch up to my second floor unit due to an awning. They stored my couch for free and then came back a week later with a creative and innovative way to successfully get my couch through the window! They came back to move me out of the same unit this year; Tom remembered me and was super helpful in facilitating the move out. They were so friendly the whole time and truly made both of my moves easy! All of the movers both times were super friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend them for anything. [REVIEW_3] My fiancée remembered Paul the bartender from a previous establishment; and found out he had moved to the Empire Bar at Broussard's.  Amazing classic cocktails - we had a Sazerac; a Ramos gin fizz; milk punch; and he had some Absinthe (not my taste).  The other bar staff all agree that Paul is very exacting about his cocktails - the right preparation; glass; garnish; presentation.  We had the Oysters Rockefeller for a snack; really delicious - four perfectly fried oysters on a dish of spinach with cheese; served with fresh bread.  In a city with dozens of great bars and restaurants; this one is a can't-miss. [REVIEW_4] Southern Transit Repair refinished a large curio cabinet that had belonged to my mother-in-law.  The cabinet was very outdated because of the light wood and a door had been damaged during a move.  After we bought new dining room furniture the curio stuck out like a sore thumb. It was recommended to me to call Southern Transit Repair to see if they could refinish it. After getting a quote they picked up the piece along with a leaf from the table to match the finish.  The end result is absolutely beautiful.  The curio looks like it came with the dining room furniture as a set and everyone in the family complements the new look.  Southern Transit Repair is not only professional in their estimating; moving; and delivery; they are also very friendly and provide high quality work.  I would recommend them to anyone trying to update an old piece of furniture and I'm looking forward to them resurfacing my kitchen cabinets. [REVIEW_5] The food was delicious . The staff was friendly . The tacos were to ""die"" for. I can't say anything bad about this place. The atmosphere was great  . I would highly recommend this place to anyone. [REVIEW_6] awesome place!!!! very dope setting large party can crash and chill.... staff here super nice.... i broke a glass of a beer and they hooked me one for free without even hesitation... awesome!! great place great beer  thanks all the staff for great hospitality!!! [REVIEW_7] Ian and Mike are amazing.  They did our entire house which included cleaning four bedrooms with carpet as well as two bathrooms and our kitchen.  The carpet turned out not only clean but incredibly soft due to the process with which they use no chemicals in the cleaning.  Our grout in the bathrooms and the kitchen was almost not recognizable.  They were incredibly efficient with their time and their service and professionalism was appreciated.  I will use them again and would recommend them (and have) to everyone.  Thanks guys! [REVIEW_8] Great experience at this beautiful clinic; really nice staff and quick service. Would defined recommend! [REVIEW_9] Amazing Creamery -- a great selection of flavors!   I sampled a variety of flavors before I had to make the tough decision of choosing which ones to eat! My friends ended getting the awesome sampler scoops (4 flavors for $5 or 6 flavors for $7) and was able to try so many flavors! I ended up with two delicious flavors -- Red Velvet and Strawberry Sangria in a waffle cone!   The decor was super cute-- chalk boards with flavors written on there in a colorful fashion; and hand made drawings were dangled about. The fill of fresh made waffle cones also permeated the air; really riles up the sweet tooth in a person. (;  Noteworthy flavors: - Creole Cream cheese (cheesy vanilla goodness) - Champagne Violet (really good vanilla flavor with a hint of floral) - Red Velvet (cream cheese goodness with chunks of red velvet cake throughout) - Strawberry Sangria (fresh strawberry taste in sorbet form) - Pop (tastes like strawberry cream soda!) [REVIEW_10] What a great little small business.  They got me in quickly; the garage was warm and inviting.  The decor was modern and fun.  Flat panel TV; couch; coffee; and an orange wall (Not to mention a sweet dog that says hello).   The staff was very nice and they fixed my one window in about 20 minutes top.  We will definitely use them in the future.  Won't be disappointed. [REVIEW_11] Went there for my birthday this summer because I'm a huge Sunny fan.  I ordered Hummus so that I didn't get drunk too fast.  It was so good; I got some to go at 2am.  If you don't get the Hummus at Mac's then I just feel bad for you.  It's so good it's almost criminal.  Trust me; I'm chubby.  I know food  :P [REVIEW_12] Perfect dinner spot !!! Went here tonight with one friend and got sat right away in a very nice private spot. We only got appetizers and coffee and it was the perfect place for that; great service and environment. Totally going to come back for more than appetizers !! [REVIEW_13] So incredibly disappointed in this restaurant.  We were so excited to try this new location of Herbie's and it did not live up to expectations.  The food was not to the quality of the prices that they charged on the menu.  The hostess sat us and the older manager was visibly not happy with where we were seated in the restaurant.  The french onion soup lacked flavor and could have used salt and pepper.  It lacked the beefy/wine flavoring that a good french onion soup should have in it.  The Beef Wellington; although beautifully presented was disappointing.  It lacked flavor and had no seasoning in it.  The Mushrooms/spinach/red pepper medley that it was paired with had CANNED red peppers in it. Seriously; a $25.00+plus dish with canned/jarred red peppers? It was like baby food.  The Flank steak had no seasoning to it and the sauce that it was served with it also lacked flavor and tasted like Mayo.  The chicken with shaved brussels sprouts salad was underwhelming.  The ""1/2 chicken"" was the size of a cornish hen. The server sold us on their ""amazing"" red velvet donuts for dessert.  That was a mistake. The donuts were hard and not warm; the ""white chocolate"" icing was hard as well and there was stale broken up donuts sprinkled around the plate with the chocolate.  The coffee was also luke warm.  We will not be back.  Herbie's needs to revisit their seasoning in the kitchen STAT and rework their menu. [REVIEW_14] So delicious! I am so happy Reno is getting more variety in it's restaurants.  Bab Cafe has a great menu; service was quick even during the lunch rush.  I had the Dak-Galbi Bibim-bab ""teriyaki chicken."" The meat was tasty; veggies were fresh; sauces were awesome. I also ordered a side of potstickers (because I can never resist potstickers) and they were so great.  Only wish it were a little easier to get to; being downtown parking can be a challenge. [REVIEW_15] So I meant to just go in and get a croissant or danish here (since I've been looking for a decent one here in reno); but managed to get distracted and buy a bunch of other things to try instead (because all their options looked delicious).   I ended up with a poppy seed pastry; a baguette and coconut cake. All were pretty amazing. The coconut cake was light and not overly sweet and I 100% will need to go back to satisfy my sweet tooth. [REVIEW_16] In and Out is the worst neighborhood take out place in West Oak Lane. I ordered breakfast (I know lol) from them about a month ago; and received pancakes that were drenched in some weird butter substance and home fries that were rock hard. I spoke to a man named Tommy; who offered all kinds of excuses about the food before finally offering me a credit.   Fast forward to this morning. I decided to give them another chance because I was hungry and had a credit. I call and am greeted by a young woman who informed me that I had two people waiting before me and asked me to hold. She proceeded to place me on hold before I could even respond. I held for about 3 minutes before she picked up. I placed my order and then explained that I had a credit. She stated she would need to look in ""the book"" for my credit. Another two minutes of waiting and surprise; she can't locate my credit. I ask to speak to a manager; and she says that the manager is out doing deliveries. Seriously...wth? She tells me I can call back later. Umm no; I'm hungry now.  I ended up canceling my order. This place is beyond ratchet and I will never order from them again. The food at Bruno's and Bally's is much better...so is their level of cleanliness and customer service. [REVIEW_17] My wife an I headed down for a quick bite.  Food came out fast and fresh.  Tacos were perfect - get the Pitmanite.  Service was great.  Can't ask for more.  It is super casual and comfortable.  Great ""homey"" vibe.  Negative reviews I think are not taking it for what it is.  We loved it. [REVIEW_18] Ambience-very comfortable; day or night. Just a lovely delicious cup of coffee served in a   cup and saucer- lovely. It's so much more enjoyable this way. And the ""regular"" size is quite generous.  Don't come here if you'd prefer to pay a fortune for a coffee drink with a name you can't pronounce; and then sit at a table to drink it from a paper cup. This place makes you feel welcome to sit and take your time at a table looking out through the large glass front; at the crepe myrtle tree lined sidewalk and little globe lights on the front patio.  It's simply my favorite place in New Orleans to get my coffee zen on. (Oh; and they do great breakfast and lunch panini) [REVIEW_19] Tessie was a fanatic guide--a font of New Orleans knowledge. I really enjoyed the whole experience and took her advice on other city spots. [REVIEW_20] Well done Saint Louis. I didn't dream of having a Boiling Crab-esque restaurant out here; but here I am. Mad Crab met my expectations and then some. The ""whole shabang"" (aka: whole shebang) medium and mild seasoning was amazing! The half dozen oysters tasted beautifully fresh and the staff were gracious in my requests for salt and pepper and hella limes.  I think this is a great first date place! Take advantage of the fact that you and your date can get messy together in a fun and casual setting! And; if he/she doesn't like cajun seafood; you know they're not the one!  My advice to the management; if they read reviews; is to have their wait staff add that extra human touch by tying the bibs for their customers. Boiling Crab does that and that extra little service goes a long way. In addition; consider providing wet wipes for their customers with their check.  Overall; well done and I'll be sure to recommend Mad Crab to my Saint Louis friends. [REVIEW_21] ABC Dentistry and Dr Singer make a visit to the dentist like going to Disney. The new set up definitely makes kids feel at ease which makes dental appointments so much easier. I would highly recommend this to any parent with a child who is terrified. [REVIEW_22] Dr Mack is awesome. Great staff and quality over quantity.. I came to him after another eye surgeon (around the corner) totally messed up my eye from eye lid lifts.; i was in bad shape. I had these masses in my lower lids that needed removal.; he got me in very fast and helped me calm the damage down.; a few days later he removed the masses. I am way better and hopefully when my eyes calm down he will fix my left eyelid that the other dr **itco left uneven. Thanks Dr Mack [REVIEW_23] Awesome service and food.  Served with a dry ice fog thing that add a layer of coolness to the whole experience. [REVIEW_24] This hotel is a hidden gem in the desert! Clean rooms; cozy ambience and excellent customer service. Free cookies; free breakfast and free use of the business center. Highly recommend [REVIEW_25] We have been here a couple times for happy hour and several times for dinner.  So we're on our way to being ""regulars."" The food quality is excellent; and prices are good -- good value for the money. (Roasted cauliflower and lamb chop appetizers are very good; salmon and short ribs entrees are tops.)  Service has been WONDERFUL. We ate here one night with a friend who had suffered a stroke. The restaurant was very busy; and our friend insisted on trying to order himself; despite a great deal of difficulty in making himself understood. Roy; our waiter; was SO PATIENT; caring and compassionate -- he was just the best.  Tonight we were back and he waited on us again (without our friend with mobility and speech impairments) and again; Roy has got to be the best server in Tucson: he's  knowledgeable; honest; competent; efficient; and friendly without being obsequious or stuffy. Nox is not a fancy; ""white table cloth"" kind of place; but for a friendly; cozy; fun place in the neighborhood; it doesn't get better than this. [REVIEW_26] Yes the crust has a little carbon on it; maybe because it is cooked in a  woodfire oven?!?! Simple tasty thin crust pizza; tasty salad; good beer and wine selection. Probably one of STL's best pizza spots. Service was just fine. Had a very satisfying experience! [REVIEW_27] Stayed here two nights for a conference. The rooms were very clean; comfortable; and fairly modern looking. Convenient location; definitely safe. All staff was very friendly. Lobby is busy; but nice place to sit [REVIEW_28] Very nice place; fast service; got our beers quick; patio is cool as hell; it was cheap. No complaints. Good ass place. [REVIEW_29] Authentic boba tea. You can customize the sweetness and add various delicious treats! Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a nice drink! [REVIEW_30] This was our second choice after finding out Rio Mar was closed for Mardi Gras week. We had a hell of a time getting here since it was on the other side of the parade from where we were staying.    Nonetheless; we had a great meal.      Service was spot on. Professional but not overbearing or obvious.      A little disappointed that they were out of two ingredients for one of their signature cocktails; but it WAS the day before Mardi Gras.    The bread and butter at the table was excellent. Crunchy outside; soft inside.    The beets salad was so much better and different from similarly named items at other restaurants. The greens literally tasted like they had been picked from a sun warmed field minutes before.     G's Choucroute was a meaty fiesta. He loved it. My crab ravioli was lovely with a delicate Meyer lemon sauce.      Bread pudding for dessert was just how we like it - sans raisins.     Truly a memorable meal. Way better than most hotel restaurants.",28
7,"[REVIEW_1] Hmmm...neighborhood sketchiness factor on a scale of 1-10 was about a 5.    But the idea of being able to have a crunchy on the outside; fluffy on the inside ball in my mouth made the trip well worth it.  I'm talking about big fried falafel balls in my mouth!!!!!  I was surprised to see how busy the place was and the variety on their menu.  We had an order of falafels---a little on the pricey side----6 for $6.99--but I suppose they were a little bit larger than some other places that I have been to.  These were pretty good.  The brother had the gyros with the greek salad.  The salad looked amazing; big chunks of feta; and stuffed grape leaf; a scoop of potato salad (ok this part didn't really look too greek to me; but it was good!); sissy and law and I had the shish kabobs.  Large portions on the platters.  Rice; beans; and a tasty cucumber/tomato salad.  The flavors were spot on and we left with full tummies.  Will definitely return to try some of the other interesting looking things on the menu (fish and wings sound quite lovely)! [REVIEW_2] So incredibly disappointed in this restaurant.  We were so excited to try this new location of Herbie's and it did not live up to expectations.  The food was not to the quality of the prices that they charged on the menu.  The hostess sat us and the older manager was visibly not happy with where we were seated in the restaurant.  The french onion soup lacked flavor and could have used salt and pepper.  It lacked the beefy/wine flavoring that a good french onion soup should have in it.  The Beef Wellington; although beautifully presented was disappointing.  It lacked flavor and had no seasoning in it.  The Mushrooms/spinach/red pepper medley that it was paired with had CANNED red peppers in it. Seriously; a $25.00+plus dish with canned/jarred red peppers? It was like baby food.  The Flank steak had no seasoning to it and the sauce that it was served with it also lacked flavor and tasted like Mayo.  The chicken with shaved brussels sprouts salad was underwhelming.  The ""1/2 chicken"" was the size of a cornish hen. The server sold us on their ""amazing"" red velvet donuts for dessert.  That was a mistake. The donuts were hard and not warm; the ""white chocolate"" icing was hard as well and there was stale broken up donuts sprinkled around the plate with the chocolate.  The coffee was also luke warm.  We will not be back.  Herbie's needs to revisit their seasoning in the kitchen STAT and rework their menu. [REVIEW_3] I LOVE this place! If you are looking for a quick adjustment without all of the unnecessary chatter about supplements and yoga then this is the place. I was in and out in ten minutes and I felt amazing. I had all of my questions answered and felt well taken care of plus it is super affordable. [REVIEW_4] Great customer service! We were a little out of their pick up area but they were very accommodating and came and got our group of 7. When we got there we realized we were billed for 8 instead of 7. I called and he refunded my money for the extra ticket in minutes!  The tour itself was SO much fun! We were laughing and smiling and our tour guide was funny! We saw lots of alligators! From babies swimming in the water to full grown ones! We saw turtles and birds too! Our tour guide had a baby alligator we could hold that he's raising until it's a little bigger since it was a late hatch that would have died because of when it was born. The ride back was fun too because we went fast and the guide did some ""tricks"" with the boat! I highly recommend this tour!!! [REVIEW_5] Thanks SO much to Jacob...  A beautiful day spent skiing at Squaw ended with my realization that I had lost our car keys somewhere on the mountain. I had Security call every lift we'd hit and they took my name in case the keys were turned in. Do I call Toyota? Do I have to tow my car back to SF? I looked up ""locksmith"" on my phone's Google Maps app and Alpine came up (their Truckee office). Jacob had obviously dealt with the situation before. He gave me a price quote in about 30sec and gave me an accurate time frame as to when he could get to Squaw. He even called when he was running a few minutes late. We enjoyed a nice happy hour in the meantime and when he got to the parking lot; I think it took him less  than 4min to get our key code and create us some new keys. Thanks for saving the day! Honest; quick service. Hope I never need to call them again under the same circumstances; but they'll be the first I call I make if I lose another set of keys. (Alpine accepts AAA). [REVIEW_6] Terrible service. My friends and I waited at least a half hour for a drink. We were at the FRONT of the bar and were ignored time after time after time!!! We kept waving for the bar tender; however he seemed to be high on his horse and served everyone else but us. We were about to walk over to another bar when he finally asked what we wanted. I told him how long we had been waiting and that we kept waving him down. He disregarded our comment. We just walked away because I did not want to be served by this rude man. There is no place to sit unless you have a VIP table; which is terrible. I've been there twice since they have opened and have not had a good time there. Hire new staff that actually know what guest service is. [REVIEW_7] Wow!!!!   What an awesome Cuban. I was googling places by my work and thought I'd give it a try. 10 stars!!!  Everything was so fresh!!  Can't wait to come back and try the other Cubans. [REVIEW_8] Not Authentic Indian.. its more like the american chinese restaurants!!! Biggest Pet Peeve was the Biryani.. the rice was undercooked and chicken tasted like it was borrowed from another curry...   Also the server was extremely intrusive. [REVIEW_9] In and Out is the worst neighborhood take out place in West Oak Lane. I ordered breakfast (I know lol) from them about a month ago; and received pancakes that were drenched in some weird butter substance and home fries that were rock hard. I spoke to a man named Tommy; who offered all kinds of excuses about the food before finally offering me a credit.   Fast forward to this morning. I decided to give them another chance because I was hungry and had a credit. I call and am greeted by a young woman who informed me that I had two people waiting before me and asked me to hold. She proceeded to place me on hold before I could even respond. I held for about 3 minutes before she picked up. I placed my order and then explained that I had a credit. She stated she would need to look in ""the book"" for my credit. Another two minutes of waiting and surprise; she can't locate my credit. I ask to speak to a manager; and she says that the manager is out doing deliveries. Seriously...wth? She tells me I can call back later. Umm no; I'm hungry now.  I ended up canceling my order. This place is beyond ratchet and I will never order from them again. The food at Bruno's and Bally's is much better...so is their level of cleanliness and customer service. [REVIEW_10] We've been hearing of a new menu in the works for months since the much-ballyhooed original chef who developed the current one apparently didn't work out. The current kitchen staff executes the current menu rather badly. Chipotle shrimp tacos were bland and missing ingredients promised on the menu. At breakfast at least the waiter (one he showed up at breakfast) was honest in admitting that the salmon was no longer house-smoked as the menu says. Respect your customers enough not to lie to them on an easily corrected paper menu. Corned beef hash was more like chili; swimming in a sea of greasy broth in a bowl. Will give it one more strike if they get around to a new menu before improving. [REVIEW_11] Easily the worst meal I had in five days of eating out 2x a day in Philly.  Server recommended the pork sandwich over their cheesesteak - I thought; this is Philly; how could I go wrong with pork?  Wrong - pork was nice; roll was great; and they ruined it with canned gravy.  Drinks were nothing to write home about; and the place is basically a dive bar.  You could do so much better.  Everything here seems to be right out of the freezer or can. [REVIEW_12] Used to come here while on business to the city. Dive bars are hip. Not this one. This one is just a mess. Bugs; I mean COCKROACHES; crawl along the bar and into people's coats (I overheard). I have seen the roaches and had a few crawl onto my hand. In the men's bathroom there's just a trash bag taped on the wall where a urinal used to be.  I have also overheard that 3 female employees have quit. Which makes it seem like it's not a safe place for ladies.  The bartender I encountered seemed very overwhelmed and perturbed with serving customers that weren't  friends and that weren't doing shots of cheap liquor. Bartender was also playing obnoxious hip hop too loud and denied access to the jukebox that clearly was just paused; not ""broken""; like he poorly tried to explain. I believe ownership or management changed since the last time I visited. Definitely not what it used to be. [REVIEW_13] The worker was awesome; this is a review for the company.  The price paid isn't in alignment to the service provided; it is just expensive. The worker is still paid hourly; which motivates him/her to work the hours. I believe it is a better way to hire someone off craigslist and pay them to do a service; rather than hourly. [REVIEW_14] They have the WORST service advisors! Used to be good before Kelly and her team left. Unfortunately; it's convenient to work if I need oil change before I can make it to another Honda dealer. [REVIEW_15] Came in with my girlfriend a couple of months ago and ordered 2 drinks.  Girl ringing up my order seemed new; was running around attempting to make my coffee and asking the other barista (also at the counter) how to make the drinks we ordered AS HE CONTINUED TO MAKE HIS OWN DRINK AND TASTE TEST SYRUPS.  IT TOOK 15 minutes to make TWO DRINKS IN AN EMPTY SHOP.   The guy who sat there and stared at me as we waited never made one attempt to make my drink after I tipped 20% on the order.  Two coffees; $12.50 ; 15 minute wait; empty shop.  Do the math.  This isn't the first time it has happened; staff is usually unfriendly.  I was coming in everyday and buying coffee but I got sick of spending my money with people who act like jerks.  I wrote an email to the shop and they never responded which is 100% proof they don't give a damn about bad service.  AS MUCH AS I LOVE COFFEE SHOPS I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS PLACE. [REVIEW_16] If you are thinking of staying here for a wedding night; DO NOT!! I have stayed at many other Embassy Suites over the years and have always had a great stay. This happened to be a very different stay. From the check in when my daughter told them it was her wedding weekend and the response was ""Oh"". The housekeeping staff never cleaned the room so the wedding night was an unmade bed with no clean towels. Bellman never showed up to help with bags so the wedding party all dressed in long dresses had to handle the cart and take care of the brides dress. The whole experience from each department failed. Valet was slow and they weren't about to help with the bags or help anyone into the car until $20 came out. We were late to the wedding because of the staffs inadequacies. Stay at the Marriot across the street. They are more accommodating. [REVIEW_17] The food ranks 3 stars but the service ranks only 1/2 star; dragging the over-all star rating down to a sub-zero number.   I walked up to the counter; was looked at (though not acknowledged) and; after a span of time what seemed eternal; asked by a gal standing far back from the counter; ""Do you need something?""   ""Food!"" I answered. Yep. Food.   She continued on with what she was doing: the grueling task of flipping tortillas on a grill. I full expected the woman's head to twist a complete 360 degrees; a trick I once saw in the movie ""The Exorcist"". If I had been wearing a cross around my neck I think she no doubt would have begun to manifest; as her eyes were by this time rolling in their sockets and back into her head.  I promise not to bother you again.... [REVIEW_18] I have been in the industry a long time and this is one of the best places I have ever been to.  The menu is great (and super reasonably priced); the wine list is phenomenal; and the service was superb.  Moreover; the atmosphere was beautiful. I would recommend this place to anyone. Specifically on Wednesdays; they have half off all bottles of wine including their reserve list! Insane deal! Happy dining! [REVIEW_19] Always good food!  My favorite would be the carne seca cheese crisp and the carne seca burro!  Must have when I'm in town. [REVIEW_20] Short and sweet - Been here three times and haven't been impressed. This last time I called in an order. The guy taking my order was rude and not helpful. I don't know the menu and asked him some questions and he knew about as much as I did. When arriving to pick up. Had to look for service. Was surprised by the 27$ bill for one entree. Got home; missing salad; over cooked steak; over cooked fries. Never again. Hope not everyone has that experience! Good luck.   P.S bring your cash cow. This place is PRICY especially for the quality of food [REVIEW_21] TL;DR: View/ambience: excellent; Food - Good (not great - honestly; if you're considering this place for the food; just go to Vernick); Service - extremely poor (why you're reading this review)  I'm not the type of person who regularly writes yelp reviews - I like most places where I eat and don't feel the need to write about it. That being said; because our experience at R2L was so anomalous; I felt I had to warn people about the service.   While the food was good; and the view was wonderful; we had an unfortunate experience. At the beginning of our meal; the waitress was friendly and built a rapport with us. However; there was an unfortunate incident where someone (not our server) on the waitstaff knocked a glass of water on one of us and spilled our bottle of wine on the floor. No wine got on either of us; and we were very understanding - mistakes happen. We get it. Here's where problems arose.   What great service would have been: Provide a glass of wine promptly to make up for the amount spilled and comp something trivial; like a desert or app.   What reasonable service would have been: Provide a glass of wine promptly to make up for the amount spilled.   What actually; unfortunately; happened: The waitstaff gave us a bunch of napkins and apologized a couple of times. One of about three people hurriedly cleaning us up promised us 2 extra glasses to make up for the wine that had soaked into the carpet. Finally; the gentleman who made the mistake was very apologetic. Up until this point - totally fine.   Then; after a few minutes of everyone; including our formerly-friendly server; avoiding us like they heard there was a sudden outbreak of the Zika virus at our table; our server finally resurfaced to refill water. When one of us asked whether that wine was coming out (after all; someone we hadn't met before promised it then disappeared); rather than reassuring us; this was the response; verbatim: ""You didn't finish the bottle yet. We were going to bring it out when you finished the bottle."" Excuse me?   After the flippant response; our waitstaff's avoidant behavior continued. We finished our bottle of wine with dinner; then ordered a dessert (hey; maybe this would give them a chance to be reminded by the wine stain in the carpet that they promised to compensate us for our overpriced loss with a glass?).  Frustrated; we asked for the check. After our waitress ran our card; FINALLY; upon returning our check; she poured our two drinks; without speaking a word to us; as we were about to leave.   We expected better from a such a supposedly classy establishment. We cannot in good conscience recommend this restaurant to others. [REVIEW_22] This store was such a huge disappointment. We are new to Arizona; and I was excited to visit due to the great reviews. I went in search of kitschy SW décor; and I couldn't stay long. The entire store reeked of urine. It was more than my poor nose could handle. [REVIEW_23] Thanks to yelp for helping us find this place!  It was amazing!!!  The food was delicious and the atmosphere perfect.  I had biscuits and gravy - so yummy!!  My husband had eggs; bacon and cheesy grits...  to die for!  When we are back in the area we will definitely return here. [REVIEW_24] Walked in; excited to try the burger and tots. Small place but; 3 tables open. We sat down and were ignored Until mgr came over to ask if our name was on the waiting list; we said we passed the hostess and she didnt asked us for our name for waiting list. He said people were waiting; meanwhile; no visable people in cue to sit! He told us to get up and wait in a corner near the bar! We left! We had just been in a large group who dropped $$$$ on drinks; snacks at the sister restaurant Tinto next door too. Rude! [REVIEW_25] Everything you want to eat and drink is here.  The wine section is extensive.  A trip to the cheese room is heavenly.  The prepared foods are delicious.  The marinara sauce is to die for.  They have hoagies and paninis made to order.   Visit the coffee bar for some serious brews.  The gelato looks and tastes very close to the real deal in Italy.    They have a covered outside seating area that is cozy yet spacious.  You can even go grocery shopping here.    What is not to like about this place?  If you like Italian food you owe it to yourself to check this place out. [REVIEW_26] After reading reviews we headed for Herbie's for brunch yesterday. 'Sorry to say it was a big disappointment. We waited  15 minutes to place a drink order and it took another 20 minutes for the drinks to arrive. They must have driven to the brewery to get that Bud Light. A Bloody Mary can't possibly take that long to make; can it? Our food was good but lukewarm.  Eggs Benedict just taste better when they are hot.  We won't be back. [REVIEW_27] That's the last time I go there. I went to mail a package; and when I went to pay the $5. 55 cent charge; he said ""Oh; you want to use that debit card? That will cost you an extra $1.00.  So now they are penalizing you for using debit? From now on; I will drive my butt back to the post office and mail my stuff like I used to. [REVIEW_28] Horrible customer service.  Customers should be allowed to try on another size.  The sales associate actually refused to get me another size; which is not what I have experienced at other stores.  I wasn't asking for anything out of the ordinary; I only took in 2 bras and wanted ONE of them in a different size.  The store wasn't busy so I don't understand her reluctance. You can give me advice on how it should fit; but don't make me stand there peeking out of the fitting room doorway; half dressed; trying to justify why I just want to *try* the next size up.  I know how I want my lingerie to fit and will go elsewhere where I won't be put in such a humiliating situation. [REVIEW_29] Came here for lunch today - sat down and got our menus - then waited and waited and waited - spent quite a bit of my lunch break from work waiting - no server! Left and went somewhere they would actually serve us. Not cool! [REVIEW_30] Here's an update for my further Comcast experience. Our bill was increased to 250.00 a month. We called and removed some luxery items which brought our bill to 225.00 a month. Called 4 time a to see how we could get our bill lowered; as we have been a loyal customer for 14 years. ""Nothing we can do"" was all I heard. We decided to no longer be raped by this company and set up service with Verizon. Called Comcast to cancel once we got hooked up with Verizon. All of a sudden; they can do better and reduce my bill to 140.00 a month....which I would have been extremely happy with. Unfortunately; it should have been offered the four previous times I called.  I have Verizon now and have been quite happy with the installation; customer service; and overall product.  I wish Comcast would go under because they don't care about quality customer service. They could offer me a years free of service; yet I wouldn't take it on principle. Screw you Comcast!",9
8,"[REVIEW_1] Prettay prettay pretty good.  Nice outdoor area and the craft beer is great.  Staff is nice. [REVIEW_2] CycleBar is an amazing cycling studio!   I went a few times during the free trial period and I can't wait to go back. The classes have amazing energy and the instructors I've had have been nothing but energetic and fun. I have to say my favorite classes are the Happy Hours with Chris S.  He's as animated and hilarious as you would want someone kicking your ass before the weekend needs to be.   CycleBar has shoes to make for ride as comfortable as possible; awesome music and tv screens in the studio as well as towels at the ready. Be sure to check the weight of the bar at your bike! Could get ugly when that arm part comes along during your ride!   Be sure to take advantage of the water bottles and snacks available pre or post ride! Could be really helpful to energize your bod before the 50 min ride.   Lots of themed rides; promos and events at CycleBar Carmel as well! [REVIEW_3] Red Lobster used to be THE place to go back in the day; even more so if you were landlocked with no access to seafood. But sadly; it's just become a shell of its former glory. The lobster tank was the perfect metaphor for today's experience; vacant cold and empty.  Despite this one star review I think our server Ryan was great. He was personable; friendly and proactive. You do the best you can with which you are given.  Cleanliness: 0 stars. Our table appeared clean but I came to discover that no it's not the table varnish peeling off; it's in fact grease of some nature; most likely butter. The crumb catchers in the booth were full of crumbs and food particles; the menu could have used a wipe down and the silverware was spotty. Even worse were the implements served with the appetizers. The spoon with the lobster and artichoke dip had dried food stuck to it and the greasy mussel spoon had fallen into the broth before getting to the table. The to go boxes had fingerprints all over them and the entree plates weren't much better.  Food quality and taste: 1 star. Food was served hot and in a timely fashion but quality was low. My salad was comprised of ice burg lettuce which is par for chain restaurants; though every piece I received was white. The cherry tomatoes were soft; not firm and the carrot shavings were dry and discolored like they had been sitting around awhile. The mussels were very strong in taste; and not in a good way. I ate only two out of fear that they might not agree with me later. The broth was garlicky and delicious and the lobster artichoke dip was also quite good.  The stuffed flounder entree was served with asparagus cooked within an inch of its life. Limp; and fibrous. The flounder was a very small filet served over the seafood stuffing that had crab shell in it. I didn't finish the small portion because I officially decided today that no matter what or how I try fish; I just don't like it.  Overall; a pretty anticlimactic lunch date served with a side of disappointment. I hope Ryan either makes a lot of money somehow or has plans on going to a better restaurant in the future. [REVIEW_4] Wow.  I have to say incredible.  We've driven by the place several times and always had that ""meh' attitude because of how the plaza looks.  Since the wife was craving some crispy duck it came up as having the best reviews for it.   Walking in; was a great traditional indian/thai setting with a comfortable small raunt demeanor.  We tried the mussel appetizer; while the wife got the Tamarind Duck and I tried the Panang Curry with calamari.   Service was prompt; quick and non invasive.  Mussels were tasty; but the Duck and Curry were to die for!  Portion sizes are definitely reflective of the prices so don't feel like you are going to get gyped.   We will be back to at least try the sushi or get more duck seeing as they have at least 2 more styles of it.   Happy tastebuds! [REVIEW_5] We went for lunch on Saturday.  They only serve from a brunch menu.  It was very disappointing.  They really need to re-think the brunch menu and serve items from their good at.  I never had dinner her although I would assume it is better than the brunch items.  I had the meatball omelette which was just ok.  I would say anywhere else would have better omelets. My husband had the burger with an egg on it.  He thought it was good but there are better burgers out there.  I should have went with my gut instinct after seeing the brunch menu but decided to stay since it was Joe Madden's restaurant.  I say skip this place and go down the street to Goody Goody. [REVIEW_6] Cool place if anyone would wait on you.  Hung around for 15 minutes and watched the bartender and wait staff chat at the bar.  There's plenty of places to drink in the casino.  I find it strange how Peppermill prices identical food and drink items differently between establishments in the casino. [REVIEW_7] Really truly slow service.  Not the waitress. The kitchen. 40 min to get a pasta and salad.  Recommended if you want to really drag that date out. [REVIEW_8] I spent New Years Eve here; and it was truly the most memorable one I may have ever had. I live in NYC; but travel to New Orleans often for New Years and this year it was a total of 10 of us traveling. We had a table at Marche together and it was the most elegant; fun evening. We had perfect views the fireworks at midnight from the deck and all the windows. The food was exceptional (buffet and passed hors d'oeuvres) and the waitstaff all went above and beyond. Brandi; one of the waitresses is truly happy seeing others have a great time and felt our smiles were her reward - other major cities seeking solid waitstaff should clone her. This was Marche's first NYE party and I suspect this will be the hottest ticket in New Orleans in the upcoming years. [REVIEW_9] I haven't been here since before I could drive so I had no idea what I was getting into ha. But the process is super easy. 1-Parking! You can park for free in their parking garage and then take the sky bridge over into the museum. 2-tickets! You can buy online or there. 3- the museum! There are four or fiveish levels with different activities per floor. There's anywhere from mummies and dinosaurs to culture and science to a chocolate slide. Almost everything is free; the carousel costa a dollar to ride and you have to get a token out of a machine. But of course it's crazy full of kids and parents and learning. We went during a weekday and it wasn't too crazy. Makes for a very fun 3-4 hours running around. [REVIEW_10] I had one of the top three worst restaurant experiences of my life here. One example is that my wife got a lukewarm burrito and sent it back after talking with the manager. The burrito came back partly eaten....by the chef....as the manager said she has the chef taste things when complained about....AND SHE BROUGHT THIS BURRITO BACK TO OUR TABLE...THE MANAGER  (who said she is part of the founding family). This is after waiting more than 90 minutes for our food. On top of that; the food is mediocre at best. Now I've read El Charro is selling burritos at 7-Eleven stores in California....enough said. Do yourself a favor and go to Poco and Mom's or even Guadalajara Grill. El Charro is WAY past its expiration date and those running it now no longer know how to serve excellent; or even decent; Mexican food. [REVIEW_11] Good food; but to me it's not worth the horrible service or the rude staff; and they only take cash or checks and there's not even a sign at the front stating so; the sign is at their cash register all the way in the back on a wall not facing the dining room. I'm not very picky and I'm never rude; so this says a lot: horrible experience. [REVIEW_12] First; Ted Drewes is more than the Christmas trees that populate its parking lot from late October to December.  It is frozen custard.  Pure sin - something that even the locals will stand on queue to eat in the dead of winter; because it's that damn good.  People have been known to give this up for Lent - and it's one of the things I actually miss about St. Louis (besides my family). [REVIEW_13] I travel to New Orleans very frequently and usually stay closer to the French Quarter at other Marriott properties but I decided to stay at the Renaissance in the arts district because of the close proximity to the WW2 museum and my expectations were far exceeded for this stay. Overall; the hotel was AMAZING and the staff was very gracious and friendly; specifically; the night supervisor; Mandy Smith; went above and beyond her pay grade to make out this visit in the FIVE STAR category. Will I be back? Yes!! [REVIEW_14] I really don't like giving out 1 star reviews when the food isn't completely terrible; but everything about this place is just so mediocre that I can't find a single reason why anyone should go here.  There are so many better options for less money that I wouldn't suggest that anyone actually eat here because you would be wasting your time and money on bland food.  Pros: The staff was friendly and the sriracha sauce for the fries was good.  Cons: They got my order wrong and forgot the bacon; but I don't think even bacon could have saved this burger.  Once I realized how much I had just paid for a burger and fries without bacon I was even less impressed with Bagger Dave's; if that's possible.  The burger was flavorless.  Not only are the portion sizes at the likes of Five Guys and Boogie Burger bigger; but I was amazed at how flavorless the meat was.  I'm no chef; but I can cook a better burger with Wal-mart beef.  The only thing I could really taste on the burger that stood out was the pumpkin BBQ sauce.  I just can't get over how pathetic this burger was; especially given how much I paid for it.  Words can't describe how let down and sad my taste buds were.  The fries were a little overdone and also somewhat flavorless; which is probably why you get a cup of sauce to dip them in.  They're definitely not on par with the likes of Penn Station or Five Guys when it comes to fries.  Overall I was quite dissatisfied with my meal.  I went in expecting some awesome new restaurant and all I got was something that doesn't even compare to Five Guys for a considerably higher price.  I honestly can't think of one good reason to even try this restaurant.  If you want a good burger go somewhere else. [REVIEW_15] Had brunch here yesterday. Nice relaxing time but terrible food.  Eggs looked and tasted like they had been held for a while after being cooked; not at all fresh. Salad on one plate had more dressing then salad; really inedible. What I did notice was the complete lack of bacon or sausage or anything pork related. Odd for a brunch; but maybe gypsies don't eat meat? The other thing I found was 1. It was 40 degrees in the bathroom; really really cold. 2. The wall next to our table really needed painting; or at least washing; food splatters and grease stains on the paint were really unappealing. The cute puffy wall coverings looked like someone used them as napkins over and over.  A tremendous disappointment after many really great experiences at Southern Cross.  It seems to me they can do a lot better; or close the place for a rehab.  We felt pretty ripped off with brunch; though the live music was awesome. Maybe dinner is better; breakfast is really hard to do well after all but I doubt we will ever find out as we have no intention of returning. In fact we cancelled our Valentine's Day reservation after this experience. Conshy girls up your game. [REVIEW_16] Excelente la comida.  Las costillas (ribs) fueron deliciosas.  We will return.  The service was great too. [REVIEW_17] This place is always awesome. Their fried chicken is great and so is their fried fish. It's hard to decide what to get when you go but do yourself a favor and get the buffalo chicken sandwich on a bun at least once. You could eat there if you wanted to but it's really more of a to go type of place. Don't get intimidated if there is a lot people there when you go. They put out food fast and accurate. [REVIEW_18] The whole staff is amazingly caring; compassionate; and superb with both their animal and caregiver interactions. Once you have had one visit with this team (and their sister location; Mass Ave Animal clinic) you will have a support network for your animals' wellbeing for life.  Additionally; the prices are very competitive; and the facilities are extremely clean and calm. [REVIEW_19] I drove from Orlando to reach a beach with SUN! I was not disappointed in this public beach. I'm seriously not that hard to please when it comes to beaches; there is something to love about every one I've ever visited.  I had no trouble parking in the spacious public lot--$1.50 per hour--takes coins and cards.   Public restroom--eh; a little unkempt; but I was able to use it without fear of being contaminated; if you know what I mean.   Outside shower and foot wash to rid unwanted sand from you and your personal belongings.  Cabanas and lounge chairs for rent; as well as other beach activities.  Extremely family friendly and clean! No trash anywhere.  Walking distance to Publix; Dollar Tree; and CVS Pharmacy. [REVIEW_20] Great food. Great customer service. Small little authentic taco joint with all the fixings. So many choices to choose from and you can't go wrong with any choice you make. I think I've had about everything they have to offer. I love the elotes cup and the sopes. You must come here! Oh EVERYTHING is made fresh! [REVIEW_21] Second night in a row at 2 Different LaQuintas; both times I am questioning whether the room has been cleaned properly; coffee stains and cup rings at one; and when I opened the door on the second; a piece of the heating/AC unit laying on the floor on one side of the bed and a empty to go cup on the other....needless to say; extremely disappointed [REVIEW_22] My sister and I stopped in a couple of weeks ago.  On the weekend; we were driving and wondering where to go to get a bite to eat. I was telling her that I was was craving a crepe.  She suggested trying The Creperie.  We found our new favorite place.  We ended up ordering both savory and sweet crepes; yummy.  The service was good; too.  I highly recommend them. [REVIEW_23] As a caveat; I give this place one star for the following reasons: the owner of this place is a very reasonable woman; and previous to my last god AWFUL experience here she gave me a great wax/facial several times; and was completely professional.  HOWEVER; my problem w/ this place was the massage I had. I read a comment below from a woman who had a masseur named Kai; and I had a similarly awful experience with this man.  Let me start by saying that I brought my roommate w/ me to get massages before we had final exams last spring; and that we both had an equally unpleasant experience. First of all; we did not know we'd have masseurs giving us massages until we got to the place. Secondly; we waited about an hour our massage; and we arrived to the salon fifteen minutes early to be courteous and on time.   Anyway; the SAME thing happened to me-- the masseur; Kai; kept the blanket off me for too long; and he rubbed a bit higher than most masseurs are supposed to. He also  creepily suggested to me that I should be a lingerie football model during the massage. Fortunately for me; I was not alone w/ this man. My roommate was in the same room (although we had requested to be in separate rooms; which was very weird).  I would also like to add we could hear the man in the next room getting a massage b/c the rooms were only separated by curtains. The entire process was disturbing and uncomfortable; and I'm alarmed this woman still has a business going.   Oh wait- there's more. My roommate's masseur also argued with her that he was rubbing as hard as he could when my roommate asked for more pressure. We both asked for deep tissue massages; and the guys honestly didn't do much else but rub us down inappropriately w/ some oil. We are very easygoing people; but when you pay over 100.00 for an hr massage; we expect to get what we paid for. My roommate's masseur also ran to the bathroom during the massage; and let's just say the doors were very; very thin... and we heard everything. He then tried to massage her afterwards; but we were both so grossed out by the two men that we asked to leave early.  The massages were HIGHLY inappropriate; disturbing; and uncomfortable. Like the other woman commented below; my masseur; Kail; got way too close to certain areas to the point where I had to ask him to stop because I was so uncomfortable. He also did not cut his nails before the massage; and I had a red scratch mark on my upper back for weeks. He ALSO told me to call him if I wanted a further massage. Needless to say; the only person I ever called from that salon again was the manager the next day to get my money back for the service-- she even offered me a free facial; but I said that wouldn't be necessary b/c I was never coming back.  This all happened last spring; and I honestly I probably blocked this experience out of my mind until I recently looked up reviews myself for a salon in the Philly area.  I'm also very shocked the manager has decided to keep these two shmucks around. [REVIEW_24] I just finished my very rushed;very awful experience at Ed's Rec Room. They have recently decided to charge bowling by time; and not by game. This has taken away all of the fun and relaxation from the game; and added an element of annoyance and panic. Also; your time begins to countdown the second you pay for it; leaving you rushing to put on your shoes and put your groups names into the system. And heaven forbid you need to take a bathroom break; or need a beverage! You don't get to PAUSE your time for ANYTHING. They didn't even have a server; so if you're hoping to have a couple beers; better get ready to run quick and get them yourself. The lane even malfunctioned a couple times; but there's no time to wait for a service worker to fix it; because they don't bother extending the time you've lost. I would have rather paid a few extra bucks a game than been forced to play a speedy game to get my monies worth. Extremely unimpressed; and will not be returning until they fix their rates. [REVIEW_25] Really good chicken tenders. Overpriced.  Drive-thru was fast and friendly. Would go back again. [REVIEW_26] All I have to say is NANCY! She is the best waitress I've ever had. My friend and I love Cracker Barrel and it is always such a treat to go in and see Nancy's welcoming smile! She is attentive; funny and excellent at making great food suggestions. Go there and great service and great food!! [REVIEW_27] You'll definitely have a wait for brunch but grab a drink and buckle in cause it's worth it. Everyone at the table loved what they ordered. We started with the buffalo cauliflower and got the pretzel pancakes; nooner; blueberry waffle and the red velvet waffle and damn if we didn't clean our plates. Also if you don't get the white trash hash you'll regret it for years to come. Service was great and our drinks were perfect. [REVIEW_28] Unbelievable great burgers. Liquid sunshine...yum. Budlight $3 @ happy hour.  Hidden gem we stumbled on thanks to yelp. Definitely will return during our 9 day Nashville drinking tour. Wonderful attentive service. [REVIEW_29] I LOVE the Fountain!! This is my favorite restaurant in St Louis! All of their food is delicious and interesting. Not your ordinary sandwiches and salads. Obviously the ice cream and ice cream martinis are great but I am partial to the Hemingway which is absinthe and champagne! [REVIEW_30] Went here with a couple co-workers for lunch and they were really good. The place is a bit small inside; so you feel a little cramped inside. However; the service is quick. They were busy when we arrived around 12:30 (so right at lunch) and they still kept everything moving in a very quick pace. Plus the amount of food you get is pretty decent; and they are pretty inexpensive. Will be back for sure.",19
9,"[REVIEW_1] so we ordered brisket sandwiched from here waited forever for it to arrive and when the food came they had run our of brisket and given us roast beef instead. They never bothered to tell us that and some of the order was wrong completely. we called them and said they would remake the wrong items not the roast beef and they wanted the food back. the staff were very rude [REVIEW_2] Came here for the great vegetarian options; but left very dissatisfied. Burrito was unseasoned; nothing inside only rice; and black beans. I wouldn't come here again.  Definitely not real Mexican; and customer service was horrible. [REVIEW_3] The food and service were sooo disappointing I felt compelled to join Yelp and write this review.  The food was exceedingly bland and flavorless.   I had the beef sate with chinese broccholi  which was advertised as spicy.  Not only wasn't it spicy but the sauce had no flavor at all let alone spice or sate.  The spring roll was doughy with limp(not crisp) veggies and bland.  The duck abalone soup was the only part of the meal that had some slight flavor. My companions had the duck with vegetables over rice which looked very dry; and the vegetables had a burned oily flavor.  Another had the pork over  rice which was salty but otherwise underseasoned as well.   We waited about 15-20 minutes before our order was taken;  and the wait for the check was long as well.  The appetizers and entrees all arrived at the same time.  I've had better Chinese food from food carts.  My least satisfying meal in Chinatown; and I eat out alot all over the country. [REVIEW_4] This place was terrible.  We had a muffin out of the case that you could have used to play hockey with.  I had the breakfast nachos and they used a microwave to cook a fake egg. How hard is it to cook a real egg?  Do not waste your money.  I have had better food on a flight in China.  Coffee and smoothly were adequate. [REVIEW_5] So it's 6:30 pm and all flights at the airport are delayed due to weather. This pizza place is right in the middle of the terminal so it's a good place to grab a bite. Here's the problem. They have no food! I ordered a salad and was told ""we are all out of salads""; then I ordered a slice of margarita pizza and was told that all that is available is pepperoni or cheese. The lady behind me wanted garlic knots; they were out. The place was empty at first so it's not like they sold out. They just didn't stock well. They have one kid working there and he makes one pizza at a time. Don't have a menu up if only 2 of the 11 items are offered! The pizza was fine but it was really a strange experience. [REVIEW_6] I've never had to write a review based on horrendous service/hospitality alone; but I've also never felt so humiliated as I did when I visited Wings Over Broadway for the first time the other night.  I was really looking forward to trying this place since people rave about how good the wings are and the great Tuesday night specials. I was coming from work so I arrived a few minutes after my party. The restaurant was half-empty when I arrived and there was no one waiting in line; so I went to my friends' table where their food had just arrived. That's when I was informed by the waitress that I couldn't sit down.  The manager came over and explained the policy of ""no add-ons"" to a table; and the waitress offered me one of the (many) empty tables; where I would be ""allowed"" to sit BY MYSELF; as if I was some kind of pariah. My friends were aghast and we explained that we'd never been to Wings before; and they would never have invited me if they'd known I wouldn't be allowed to join them.  I said I understood the policy for busy nights; and in the future we'd certainly abide by it; but since there was no one waiting for a table it couldn't hurt for me to sit down.  Then the owner came over and very rudely said; ""Fine; you can sit down. But you have to pay full price for wings; no special for you."" He and the manager were glaring at me; totally unsympathetic. I've never felt so insulted; and never before experienced this sort of treatment from a restaurant. It pretty much ruined my day.  To the owner of Wings: I was the nicely-dressed young lady that you turned away; and I'll be telling everyone I know how you made me feel and to avoid your establishment in the future. [REVIEW_7] Not Authentic Indian.. its more like the american chinese restaurants!!! Biggest Pet Peeve was the Biryani.. the rice was undercooked and chicken tasted like it was borrowed from another curry...   Also the server was extremely intrusive. [REVIEW_8] Poor service to start off with. Server was abrupt and seemed to be kind of snippy I guess you could say. Waited 25 minutes for food and when it arrived it was luke warm at best. Something we had never seen before but they would not let a couple pay individually. There were 3 couples in our party. Safe to say we will not be going back. [REVIEW_9] I assume that Alsatian translates into ""Meatlovers Paradise""!  First; the amazing happy hour of 50cent oysters; then the $10 Pate plate. I never thought of myself as a ""Liver"" man but John Besh has turned me into one.  The service was adequate if a little over-bearing but the food and drinks made up for it... [REVIEW_10] Purchased a 2015 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited over the summer.  Took it into South County Dodge to get the leather replaced on the drivers seat due to defect & they somehow managed to break the entire frame requiring me to get a rental.  Enterprise gave me a Chrystler 200 which would have been fine except the fact that it is absolutely filthy and has a giant rock chip right in the drivers line of site.  Yesterday I found out the part for my Jeep won't be in until 10/30 at which time I told them I would need a different rental due to the disgusting state of the current one.  I received a call at 7:45am today letting me know they had a Fiord Fusion for me at which time I told them I would be by on my lunch break between 11-11:15.  I got to the dealership and there was no car.  I waited for 30 additional minutes before leaving.  Not only is their fleet poorly maintained they have zero respect for anyone's time.  It's now 4:30; I still have the disgusting 200 and no one has even bothered to follow up or apologize for once again dropping the ball.  Skip the headache and go to Avis...they have never failed me. [REVIEW_11] It seems this place might have been good in the past but has recently been getting worse. I'm not sure if they changed ownership or if the guy that owns it has just gotten tired of having the business but it is definitely not a place to have a good time which is what people intend on doing when they smoke a hookah.  I read reviews on here before going and thought I would never visit this place until a friend of mine invited me.  I was hesitant but he talked me into coming by.  The reviews that speak of racism are correct. If your not white or Indian then definitely don't go here.  (however I am a white woman and still was treated bad; perhaps becasue I came with a lady and not a man? who knows.)  When we walked in the door they told us we had to order to stay but they wouldn't give us time to look at the menu. They stood over us and every 30 seconds were aggressively telling us that we had to decide on something or get out. We didn't order quick enough so they escorted us while yelling at us in their language and making rude gestures the entire way out. The owner continued to curse us as we crossed the street to leave in our car. Someone unknowingly; might think this was just a bad day. After reading others awful reviews it seems this is the norm.   Unfortunate and disappointed [REVIEW_12] The gelato may be very good; but I can't remember after such a negative dining experience.  With the exception of one person (the owner?) the staff were pretty missable.  Not a single smile to be had.  I don't expect my behind kissed; or even small talk; but I don't expect to give business to an establishment that hires people who seem bothered to be there.  There are three tables inside with ample room for a few more---not very family friendly.  Me; hubs and three children under 3 waited patiently for a table.  The icing on the cake was other customers---a lady practically climbed over my daughter to grab my hubs' seat when he got up to use the bathroom.  Seriously.  Not the establishment's fault; but all around poor attitude and rudeness abounded.  We won't be returning.  If you have children; pass on this place and enjoy ice cream at home. [REVIEW_13] I recently bought $50 worth of hair products I was specifically looking for.  While I looked three salespeople were in a conversation a few aisles away.  When I was walking toward the cashier; one asked if I needed any help.  Yes about ten minutes ago!  The first thing the cashier asked me was; ""What's your phone number?""  Really?  No ""hello""; have you found everything you were looking for?""  I responded it was unlisted. She looked panicked and told me it didn't go anywhere.  Then why ask?  She then asked me if I had a daughter?  I could give her phone number.  OMG; totally inappropriate question.  Besides if I'm not giving you my phone number why would I give you my daughter's she assumed I had?  I told her I don't give out personal information.    I most likely will continue shopping there; but please stop this policy of asking customers for their phone numbers!! [REVIEW_14] Because when I say I want a non smoking room;it doesn't mean put me a a smoking floor in an enclosed hotel in a non smoking room. I don't want to smell that shit EVERYTIME I walk out my door. Won't be back. Thats why I called at 3:00 to make a resi so I could get a good room. But he wouldn't make me a reservation. [REVIEW_15] I would not advise staying at this hotel. I called to speak to a manager after my friend put the post below and the manager was once again; very rude. [REVIEW_16] I wish I could go back and time and not eat here. We waited 50 minutes for cold chips and salsa; they were stale and they didn't even have picode Gallo. They charge for them! The burrito was cold; and when I asked they said they plate was suppose to be cold. Really? Cold rice and beans too?  The margarita was the only good thing and the 80's music. [REVIEW_17] Ok had Sunday lunch with my mother and grandmother here and it was just terrible. Our server didn't even tell us his name and took forever for him to take our drink order. We asked for sweet and low with one of our unsweet teas and didn't receive it. Had to ask for it again to then receive the sweet and low. We ordered the bloomin onion and the chesse fries. The bloomin onion was not the onion the restaurant usually uses because it was on the spicy side. The chesse fires when on the ok side since they did not put much chesse or bacon on the appetizer. So in all reality we ordered a plate of fires with a little chesse and bacon. My grandmother ordered the 6oz steak and it was also on the spicy side. I however ordered the same thing but I ordered mine medium rare but when I got my steak it was rare instead of medium rare and also was really spicy.  We then had to ask for a bottle of steak sauce because if you ask for steak sauce for a party of three you will only get one tiny cup full of steak sauce for the whole table. Had to order a to go order for my father couldn't make it to lunch and our waiter said he would put it in after we had finished our meal. When we finished our food and the waiter gave us our check we still haven't received our to go order. Had to sit and extra five to ten minutes to get that said order. Lets just say we gave a bad tip. Be caution to this place not worth a hundred dollar bill for a spicy mouth and bad experience! [REVIEW_18] This was possibly the worst experience I've ever had at any restaurant.   General disappointments: They were out of orange juice; diet coke; and to go boxes. Someone waited twenty minutes to order food to go and then overheard the staff tell someone else they were out of to go boxes and couldn't accommodate any take out orders. (I think all customers would have appreciated knowing upfront that these items and services were unavailable.)  Service disappointments: While our initial interaction with our waitress was seemingly standard and friendly; I can't provide any additional positive feedback about her because we barely saw her again.The waiter who brought us our beverages informed us of their lack of diet coke and forgot 2/3 waters. We spent over 35 minutes trying to make eye contact with our waitress to get her attention - and although we made eye contact; she never came over.  We spent 45 minutes waiting for refills on water and coffee (and of course our food); while other customers who had been seated after us and were simply sitting closer to the kitchen enjoyed their food. At this point I stood up and walked over towards the kitchen to request refills; and a different waitress said she would be right with us. Ten minutes later our waitress came over with refills and said our food shouldn't be much longer.   This is now 55 minutes into our breakfast. (Just to be clear we all ordered eggs and the restaurant was not full.) While she was at our table we requested a set of utensils (since only 2/3 of our party was given a set of utensils when we were seated). In addition we requested salt and ketchup - because at this point we had high hopes our food would be arriving soon and our table was not prepared with these items unlike the other tables near us.  Finally over an hour after being seated our food arrived with unmelted cheese on the eggs and 2 packets of ketchup for our table of 3. When the waitress walked away we took the bottle of ketchup from an empty table nearby and ate our breakfast.   This was a disappointing visit to say the least. I recommend you do not visit this establishment under any circumstances. [REVIEW_19] Came here for the first time yesterday and I had their Spot burger and cheese fries. Best burgers!!!! And cheese fries are not cheese from a can! Super fresh and juicy and amazing customer service . Very clean inside. Will be returning [REVIEW_20] At 6:03pm; the PSTA Driver sped through the Marina; not even bothering to slow down to pickup the Passengers; which there were 9 Passengers waiting. That Driver (a White Guy; just to narrow it down) should be Fired Immediately! [REVIEW_21] Horrible experience; pizza was soggy and cold when I received it; took 2 hours until I actually received my order as well. Absolutely no communication on my order; even after calling twice. Once I finally received the pizza I called to get my money back; which was communicated that I would not be charged; soon to find out that I was charged the very next day. I highly recommend never ordering from here; service was horrible and they were extremely rude. I won't be ordering from here again and either should you. [REVIEW_22] If I could give Zero stars I would. We are return customers to this restaurant and now we will never return. We will go out of our way to go to the one in mid-city. We ordered the new sandwich ""The BET"" and paid an extra $2.00 for extra cheese. We received this sandwich with close to ZERO cheese. You would think for a ""cheese"" themed restaurant all of their sandwiches would be gooey with cheese. WRONG. The cheese on the sandwich didn't even cover 1/2 of the 1/2 of one side of the piece of bread. We mentioned it to Ebony at the register that we paid for extra cheese and showed her the sandwich. She brought it to the kitchen and shortly returned to us with our sandwich in hand and said ""my kitchen supervisor said there is cheese on this sandwich and he can't help us"" we asked if we can just add more cheese and she said ""if we want more cheese we will have to pay for it"" (which we already did) ""and he refuses to remake it"" terrible kitchen staff and HORRIBLE at handling service. [REVIEW_23] When I called she put me on hold 3 times. Was very rude. Then when delivery came received wrong order. She wouldn't fix this; and hung up on me 3 times. Very rude and horrible service. Don't go there [REVIEW_24] Terrible service. Went at 1pm on a Saturday and waited 25 minutes for my order (there were 2 ppl ahead of me with normal; single sandwich orders). First; the guy didn't know how to make my sandwich (a black forest ham) and skipped to the next guy in line until he could get the girl in the back to come make it; leaving me just standing there getting passed over in line. He then put the condiments on and put on an insane amount of mustard. I didn't ask for extra; I just said mustard; thinking he'd run it back and forth 2 or 3 times and that's it. Nope; he squeezed the crap out of the bottle and completely drenched it. Then he can't work the cash register; only the girl can. Just one thing after another.    I then go out front to eat and hear a car at the drive thru placing an order on the touch screen kiosk (which is actually a really good idea); but the girl inside is telling them over the mic they have to come inside to order; that they can't place there order in the drive thru. Employees at this location seriously need some training or help. Go to another location if you can. [REVIEW_25] Well; I hope I don't offend the BBQ police with this review....but I didn't order ANY BBQ here....what I did order was; possibly; the best hot chicken sandwich I have ever had....no small feat in a town that DOMINATES the world of hot chicken.  I was convinced to try out Edley's when a friend in town billed it as 'unique and gourmet BBQ'....OK; I'm not sure exactly what that means; but what the hell; I'll give it a whirl!  I like good BBQ; but I LOVE good Nashville Hot Chicken; and that just jumped out at me on the menu.  So; I throw in my order for a hot chicken sandwich....I was mildly alarmed when I was told that it only came in one level of hotness and they couldn't give me any hot sauce on the side (they did offer wing sauce).  Despite some mild reservations upon this discovery (what kind of REAL hot chicken place doesn't offer some type of 'this will kill you from the inside out' level of spice?); I pushed ahead with the order.  Damn; I AM a brave man.  We sit down and the order comes out just a few minutes later.  Here we go...after de-pickling it; I dig in.  First thing I notice is the breading: not as thick as your 'standard' hot chicken; but full of flavor.  I actually liked it better....seems lighter (but I know it's not more healthy; I'm not kidding myself on that).  The chicken was really tender and cooked perfectly.  The spice what a LITTLE on the light side; but still had enough heat for you to know it was there.    Anyway; I am a HUGE fan of this place....great food; full bar; nice set up inside; and a great patio as well.  Throw a great location on top of that; and what else could you ask for? [REVIEW_26] My boyfriend and I were looking for some good Mexican food for his birthday; and since I missed the boat on getting a reservation at El Vez I figured we would give this a try. The reviews seemed okay and everyone said that the drinks were really good.   Not at all true....  To start with; we ordered the guacamole. I have had a lot of different kinds and make it myself at home; and this was incredibly bland with not a lot of flavor.  I ordered the Carnitas Tacos and my boyfriend got the Brisket Tacos (special of the day). They were all right; but the waiter told us right off the bat he would recommend a side since they were small portions.  We didn't end up eating any of our side since they were so big; we each only finished two tacos!   The most disappointing part of this whole experience was the drinks.  I got the Classic Mojito (which I have also had and made many times before) and he got the Mexican style Mojito; that apparently is with cilantro and tequilla instead of rum and mint.  The first batch were really delicious; so we ordered another round. Not at ALL the same drink.  They looked very different; but mainly they didn't taste at all similar.  Very very sweet and acidic; way too bitter.  We politely called the waiter over and asked if the bartender wouldn't mind remaking them since the first drinks we had were very different; and he obliged. A few seconds later the bartender came back and told us she remade the drinks but tasted them and they tasted exactly how they should be.  She was very condescending and rude (My boyfriend and I have both worked in customer service before...when customers are being polite in their complaints; there is no need to be rude back) and said she would make the drink for us 10 times if we wanted but it wouldn't be any different. She said that they first AMAZING drink we had must have been made wrong.  She kept asking us how they were different and we had trouble explaining to her exactly what to change; so we decided to let it go and asked for the check. Yes; we still got charged for the shitty drinks that we left on our table.   For a tequilla bar who is apparently known for their drinks; the inconsistency is frightening.  I was very disappointed in the entire experience; not what I was planning for the first birthday that my boyfriend and I spent together. [REVIEW_27] Ordered delivery through Postmates to be delivered to our hotel room. The delivery guy was very very friendly. However; the restaurant did not pack any utensils or napkins. Please be mindful when you are packing the food. [REVIEW_28] Apartment is falling apart there is no insulation they don't repair anything. You can never get in touch with anyone the amenities are non existent there is no gate the pool is closed. The forced trash service sucks. Insects get in all the broken windows. They do anything to get you to move in and NOTHING to fix anything. You can hear your neighbors pee and everything else! Everyone has the same complaints it's crazy. We are trying to buy a house as soon as we find one we are out of here it's ridiculous. See pictures! Don't move here it's not worth it. [REVIEW_29] Salad was full of brown wilted iceberg lettuce. The pizza was cold by the time I arrived home (picked it up.) Way too expensive for this awful product. [REVIEW_30] Worst sales man ever. I don't remember his name since he gave us someone else's business card. My girlfriend and I went into look at the jeep renegade and compare it to the patriot. The salesman shows us to a base model patriot let's us take it out awkwardly sits in the back and gives us one word answers on all our questions. I asked about fuel economy and he flat out lied said the car gets well over 30 mpg which it does not. Then tells us there are some great incentives on this car but doesn't explain what they are or how much they are. We come back not really liking the car he asks us how much we want to spend we say a low number he laughs and walks away and says to look online at their used cars and come back. We ask to see the car we came to see and he dosent even acknowledge our request;I asked about a truck I was interested in and he wouldn't even let me look at it or take it for a test drive. This is the worst customer service I have ever received we could have possibly bought two cars from this dealership but I will be taking my business elsewhere.   It sounds like another reviewer had issues with the same sales man; he should really be fired for making this business look so bad.",3
10,"[REVIEW_1] I think its funny that my car needed a jump infront of their shop on broad street and i was told No because of not being able to leave the store. When asked if another employee could help he said no he is about to leave. I then asked if he can give me a jump when he leaves and i also got a NO. Funny how theycservice cars; help people with cars but cant even give me a jump. Lame service. Not customer oriented at all. Typical fat guy behind the counter surfing the web and playin on his phone. The worst [REVIEW_2] This McDonald's is as terrible as they come. They have no care; mess up every order; take at least 10mins to answer you in drive thru at slow points in the day. Stay away smdh! [REVIEW_3] so we ordered brisket sandwiched from here waited forever for it to arrive and when the food came they had run our of brisket and given us roast beef instead. They never bothered to tell us that and some of the order was wrong completely. we called them and said they would remake the wrong items not the roast beef and they wanted the food back. the staff were very rude [REVIEW_4] First off if there was a lesser rating I could give it I would. Never in my whole entire life have I ever been to a place that handled a situation so horribly. So a group of us went in for Valentine's Day; we had a reservation for 8 and were sat by 845; no big deal we were just a bit cranky and hungry. The host was very nice and was trying her best.   We finally get sat and get drinks ordered and Our appetizers. It's going well; our server was nice and we were happy. Now this is where it goes down hill. Our appetizers come out about 5-10 mins apart. We brushed it off. A party that got sat after us were now getting their entrees? We start getting irritable at this time we've been in the restaurant for 2 hours. We finally start getting out entrees. 5 people are missing theirs. Sever comes over tells our friend their out of what she wanted. Would've been nice to know before everyone stared receiving their food. But she got to pick whatever she wanted for free; not bad. Everyone is now done with their meals and My friend beside me never got her food. By this time the restaurant is basically empty. The manager comes over and just goes "" what did you have"" my friend told her then she just walked away. No apology. Nothing. Her food finally comes out and she asks our sever why was she just now receiving her food? He replies with ""oh you know the kitchen gets slammed; things happen"" our jaws nearly hit the floor. Granted they comped her meal. But everything was poorly executed and the manager never stopped by to apologize; our server never apologized.    I guessed they assumed that they were gonna go down in flames cause they thought passing out a $5 off coupon for next time would do anything. Safe to say we spent 3 hours in a restaurant for a lousy experience. The food was decent but not worth it. Like the saying goes "" you can fix lousy food with great service but you can't fix lousy service with great food"" and we don't ever; ever plan on coming back here. I get that it was Valentine's Day and it was busy; completely understood but it's the mangers job to smooth over the situation. Comping the food is great but that doesn't fix anything. Get it together macaroni grill. [REVIEW_5] I ordered delivery; food was an hour ad a half late and cold when it arrived. I was told they would be sending a free drink and dessert due to the tardiness; but those items never arrived. When I called to inquire; they said they would remake my order - though since it had been two hours since I originally ordered; I was not surprised nor did I care when that never arrived either. Food; service and punctuality were all terrible. I recommend spending your money elsewhere - this was the worst dining experience I've ever endured. [REVIEW_6] DO NOT GO HERE THEY ARE THE WORST  GO TO MASSAGE ENVY  IN MT LAUREL OR CHERRY HILL AND BE TREATED RIGHT  Hand & Stone is a money hungry thieving deceptive company. I had the worst massage at the Marlton location then as I went to pay with a Gift card that was given to me as a gift I was told by the rude receptionist that I had to pay $11.00 because my card had expired. SO I RECEIVED A TERRIBLE MASSAGE AND WAS RIPPED OFF FOR $ 11.00. I filled out a bad survey online then received a nasty email from the Manage her name is Jessika Morrow SHE WAS THE WORST I guess she feels it's ok to talk to customers like crap has horrible manager skills and should not have this position. when I said I would leave feedback as the worst place and massage I have ever had her response was I DON'T CARE DO WHAT YOU WANT... GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS The worst. I then called the Corporate Office and asked to speak to the Owners of the Franchise there names are Steve and Fred Vaccaro needless to say after leaving 3 messages for them to call me about this terrible situation they could have cared less to have called me to listen to my concerns. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO HAND & STONE AGAIN I GUESS THE $11.00 WAS WORTH LOSING A CUSTOMER KEEP IT UP AND YOU WILL BE HEADED WHERE KMART AND SEARS ARE GOING.....GREAT JOB JESSIKA WHAT A GEM... [REVIEW_7] One star isn't even low enough for how I am feeling right now. Wings over broadway use to be my favorite wing stop in Tucson until recently when we ordered 16 boneless wings.   We were DISGUSTED to find what appears to be parts of a worm inside of our wings. Usually service is alright. But that night they also happened to have the lady who appeared to be a manager lecturer one of her cooks for 10 minutes while people piled up at the counter for the one waitress on staff room orders and ran food to tables.   Needless to say; I will not be returning. And I truly do wish many others see this review and do not return as well. I spent 30 some dollars on horrible service and disgusting food. [REVIEW_8] Coming from a person who's whole family is from the bayous of Louisiana it's ok. The roux on the gumbo is a little to thick. Gumbo over jambalaya is almost insulting. Po boy wasn't a po boy it was more like a Hoagie with Cole slaw a semi blackened chicken. The flavor is kinda close (if you are a rookie to this food). If you have never had REAL creole/Cajun food you'll love it. I am of creole descent and I grew up on this food ;but like I said if you go to Louisiana (especially bayous were it started not new Orleans) you'll know what I'm talking about. For rookie creole/Cajun palates it's descent though. [REVIEW_9] Chicken was salty; I ordered 1/2 chicken; rice and plantains to go for lunch. With the chicken and rice; I only received 2 pieces of plantains & paid I've $8 for this meal. Totally not worth it. There were great reviews but it was not my day. I will have to think twice before ordering from here again. [REVIEW_10] RUDE RUDE RUDE; couldn't be bothered by myself or my friend and the small basic tattoo we wanted. Over priced the tattoo and and had the worst attitude ever. Big disappointment and let down for us. Dustin should get his head out of the clouds and come back down to earth with his holier than thou attitude [REVIEW_11] Horrible customer service! The employees here seem to hate life cause they don't smile and have a very nonchalant attitude to every customer in the line. One of the employees smelt like weed and looked like he just got done smoking a Bong! Another employee was very rude when she asked a customer not stick her hands over the glass when the customer was only trying to point out what she wanted. The employee didn't need to respond to the customer in such a rude manner. I just moved here to Brentwood and I'm very disappointed in this establishment and the employees here.   These employees either need to be retrained and taught how to smile and or just need to be replaced with humans who actually love life and don't take their job for granted! [REVIEW_12] Top 10 worst restaurant experiences of all time!  Stopped in for lunch this Sunday afternoon. I had seen the reviews about bad service here but was driving and figured WTH; let me give it a try. I am sorry i did.   I walk in and the toothpick chewing attendant is sitting on a stool. Sees me but continues to play with his phone. After an awkward 2 min staring contest motions me to 'sit where ever' wave. Brings over a cracked plastic glass with his palm covering and touching the rim of my glass and warm pitcher of water. Ordered boneless Chicken Korma was brought out by a waiter in a small cereal bowl with another small cereal bowl of microwaved rice in which we had his thumb. I wanted to walk out but honestly felt sorry for the guy given the restaurant only had one other party of three dinning on a Sunday Afternoon. Food was horriable. Instead of Chicken Korma i was given what tasted like Chicken Makhni curry over spiced and over salted to look like Chicken Korma. Waiter disappears and emerged with three fingers on a plate plopped it down and disappeared forever. I ate about a quarter of the meal and literally felt like throwing up. The meat was a mixture of white and dark meat left over from thigh or other parts (was odd shaped and some was shredded). Rice quality was good but it was tortured dry in a microwave before it was served. Asked for check. Paid and then told the attendant that i was sorry but meal was not that good. His reply ""Okay...thanks....""   For what i got and what i paid ($13) it was not only a rip off but an insult. Not once did ANYONE come over to ask if everything was ok. Rocky tables were stabilized with folded paper napkins; napkin holders on all tables are MIA. Napkins are just piled on a table with salt shakers to hold them down. How much are plastic glass and napkin holders at Ikea or Restaurant Depot? ts obvious these people don't give a crap about customers and dont have a clue about service. When they do close their doors; they will have no one to blame but themselves! [REVIEW_13] The worst mechanics in Reno.  I brought a VW jetta here for an alignment and the steering wheel was 1/4 off to the left when they gave it back.  I took it to another alignment shop the next day and they asked if these guys were retarted. as the toe; camber and caster were all very off from where they should be.  STEER CLEAR OF THIS PLACE. [REVIEW_14] Stopped by on my way out of Nashville for a quick bite. Mistake. As soon as I walked in the manager made an offensive comment about my appearance (I have long hair and a beard so she referred to me as ""baby Jesus"") Not a good start.  Food quality was very poor even for a buffet; and the stock was extremely low on everything; and what was there was cold and unpleasant. Drinks never were refilled.   I tried to salt my food and discovered not one; but all salt shakers were caked with water and unfunctional. When I asked the server for fresh salt she proceeded to check the tables and came back several minutes later with what she claimed was ""the best she could find"" rather than making a fresh bottle; and it was just as caked as the others.   If I had to say one positive thing about it; I'd say that I'm 90% positive that the steak was made from actual beef!   Do yourself a favor and never go here. [REVIEW_15] We ordered hamburgers and had to take the aweful meat off just to stomach it. Waiter apolgized but still charged us full price plus $.95 per topping instead of menu price of $.50. Also took 13 mins to ring our check up as he waited other tables. [REVIEW_16] I just had the worst experience with We Love Pets! It was not so much a specific problem with a product or a pet; but how poorly they handled a situation. I was scheduled to have dog my dog groomed as that is a new service they are providing.  My hsuband scheduled the first appointment for me to bring the dog on my day off; and I have to admit; a week later I completely forgot about it and did not bring her in.  We rescheduled for the following week; the day of the big snow storm and hence i cancelled the appointment. Last week was the third try; however the groomer was sick! So we tried again for today; making it late in day so that I would be able to take the dog in the afternoon as soon as I got home from work. Last night they left a message requesting we bring the dog in the morning. Today I spoke with them in the middle of the morning ; letting them know I was home sick; was trying to coordinate things; and would try to bring her in a little earlier; between 12 and 1. AT 1230 my phone rings could I bring her in immediately. Unfortunately; I am quite sick and was trying to coordinate doctors visit etc so it was going to be 1 pm when I would bring in my dog. I explained that I was unsure why they were calling as I had already agreed to move the time up one hour.  I was then told to hold on; and then told; not to bother and not to reschedule as this was the third time I had missed an appointment! NOT TRUE!!! I fully admit to missing the first appointment; and I had not yet missed todays appointment!  Before cancelling my appointment; they told me that their groomer was sitting there with nothing to do; so they wanted me to bring the dog in earlier. Is that my problem; that the groomer's schedule is not yet fully booked? They then told me they weren't supposed to schedule it that late. There again; it was their error in not educating their staff in the rules for scheduling grooming and this error was repeated multiple times when they continued to reschedule late in the day.  When I tried to explain my perspective; they hung up on me. So; my rating are for POOR PROFESSIONALISM and POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! [REVIEW_17] Well; they get one star for having a really sweet server who was helpful and nice. But seriously; I wish we had just waited in line for an hour at the Pancake Pantry instead. After ordering; we sat for over an hour waiting for our food. When we finally got it; it was awful - my friend's hamburger was stone cold; my biscuits and gravy had congealed after hanging our under a heat lamp or something; and my other friends eggs were lukewarm. No garnishes on the plates; no toast with the eggs; nothing special. We didn't bother to complain because no one wanted to wait another hour for food. I was really disappointed because other people's food had looked really yummy when we were waiting to be seated. Maybe because of the Easter brunch rush? But really; just no excuse for crappy meals. [REVIEW_18] This is the worst take out I've had.  All I wanted was a large salad tonight and I'm so mad I just wasted $20.  I tied ordering a taco salad and when I asked the girl for an add on of chicken; she said no. Not it will be an extra 2 or 3 dollars (which I would have happily paid) but just a no we won't do it.  I changed my order to the Udon Noodle Salad.  I was then told it would be 45 min-1 hour.  It was an hour and a half+ before I got my order.   I was looking forward to a large arugula salad with chicken and the other items; instead I got a small bowl of cold noodles with a little arugula and cold chicken. It was awful and a waste of money.  I ordered sweet potato fries on the side and they would have been decent had they not been freezing cold.  Don't waste your money! [REVIEW_19] Did not like this hotel at all. Me and my husband stayed there one night after getting off our honeymoon cruise out of New Orleans. While still on the boat I called the hotel to let them know that we would only be staying one of the two nights we reserved due to some issues with our home in Houston. We had to leave early to address them in person. I communicated that with the manager who stated that he would call me back because he was dealing with another customer. Never received a callback. We checked in Saturday March 5 at 1600. We left the next day Sunday March 6 at 1130. As we checked out I told the manager it was an early checkout and he said that I would have to talk to the third party vendor (booking.com) to not be charged. I was okay with that.  Fast forward to today. Called booking.com and the customer associate stated that the manager charged me for the second night that I never used as a penalty for not warning them of our ealy check out. He lied. I spoke to him at least twice about us leaving. DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU ARE OUT OF TOWN. VERY UNCLEAN AND DISGUSTING and the management is sketchy. Take your money and go somewhere nicer. [REVIEW_20] I went in on Friday and made a reservation for Sunday at 530 for a group of eight.  We had a show to attend at 7pm at the Fox.  Penca is a small restaurant and I knew we would not be able to walk in and get a table; hence the reservation. We showed up and we were told it would be a while; a group was seated at our table.  We waited; and waited.  I had some disagreeable word with the hostess.  We waited some more.  We got two stories - one was none at all just ""sorry""; the other was the group came in claimed the table and told the staff they were friends of the owner and they'd cause trouble if removed from the table.  Doesn't matter to me because if the latter is true the owner needs new friends since the current ones will put them out of business; and if the former is just ineptness on the part of staff they'll be out of business.   And so we waited some more.  Given the timing leaving for anything but Subway was not an option. We got seated about 35 minutes late. They comp'd us two drinks for eight people for the wait. I will give a shout out to our server who did a great job of trying to put this train wreck back on the tracks. He did a very good job. [REVIEW_21] If I could give zero stars I would. I never ever have had such an experience at an establishment. I came here with a group of 8 for a birthday dinner. We had more than 1 server. I have no idea what any of their names were. They give NO REFILLS on anything (soda; tea; lemonade; etc) which I think is insane! So they recommend buying a pitcher. The pitchers and ice bucket were both in plastic containers you can get from the dollar store.   We wait nearly 2 hours for our food. Majority of our party ordered mac & cheese as a side. Once we got our plates we noticed their was shrimp in our mac & cheese. When we questioned our server; she responded ""Oh I thought she told you we ran out"". Mind you; that is completely fine; but what if someone had a seafood allergy?   To top it off; 2 of our party members (birthday girl included) did not receive their meals. They didn't even check back at the table until we flagged them down to report the missing plates. Our server then responded; ""I honestly don't even know what you ordered"". We didn't even finish our food and the birthday girl didn't even want to eat them to even bother making her food since we had waited so long and they were closing. We asked to speak to a manager and was told they would come. When they didn't; we asked again. At this time; our ""server"" (the same one we asked to get a manager) claimed she was the manager. WHICH WE KNEW WAS A LIE.   I understand they have just opened but theres no way an establishment should be run this way. Our entrees came out on glass plates; but everything else was on paper plates.   I WOULD NOT recommend this establishment to anyone. They didn't apologize or seem interested in good customer service. [REVIEW_22] I brought a party of 4 to dinner at 6. After sitting for 15 minutes seeking waitstaff; we waited an interminable amount of time (40) minutes for a couple of salads. The appetizers were served with filthy dish-ware with food particles from the prior customer. The salads were less than delightfulwith crushed avacado slices thrown into the bowl as an afterthought. Needless to say the experience was eminently less than satisfactory. I will not ever return. [REVIEW_23] I ordered the chicken stew; it was Tasteless chicken; it was a fried chicken possibly a leftover; that was thrown into a pot and made it into a stew.  If I wanted leftovers; I would have eaten at home.  Gross; still feel like I have to throw up. [REVIEW_24] Why don't we have a Target?  I thought K-Mart was going out of business.  Well not this one; this miserable son of a bitch refuses to die.  They had the audacity to try to update it.  It reminds me of Jack Palance its old; tired; and smells funny; but it ain't going know where.    I wish a shiny new Target would come along and stab this relic of a store through the heart with its superior retail sword.  I have experienced on no less than 5 occasions of a product being labeled as on sale only to be charged full price at the counter.  Then I have to stop the line to back to the aisle and grab the sign to show it to the cashier.  Once I bought a beach chair here; well my wife saw the dopeness of said chair and wanted to copy me.  I return to the store the next day (happened to be 80 degrees and sunny) and those SOB's raised the price of the chair $10.  I was pissed yo. [REVIEW_25] Service sucks!  We had a party of 12.  We couldn't get enough chips.  We got 1!  I ordered table side guacamole and had to ask for chips.  We couldn't get drinks.  Waitress couldn't keep focused on each person and was very scattered.  Won't be back for the spendy Mexican food. [REVIEW_26] Terrible; terrible service. Entitled hipsters who confuse orders; give attitude; and ruin customer's experience. The new manager is also frumpy and has awful music taste; think awful 50s - 80s rock/reggae music that's disappeared for a reason; but blared close to full volume. Softer; more neutral music would be greatly appreciated. Terrible consistency with orders too; they don't have consistent standards with coffee etc.  Customers are mostly Penn students; business types who interact with the school (recruiters from NYC etc) and visitors to the area. It's almost as if the staff feel some kind of insecurity or have pride issues serving almost always polite patrons.   Gelato is pretty good and coffee is pretty good but can be sloppily made (I.e mix your own iced latte). Also slimmed down portion sizes and got rid of the bar. The place has a great location and nice open feel to it; but so much potential is lost because of really shitty staff with terrible attitudes. So many frequent customers but the staff make no effort to get to know them (and trust me; they try). I can't emphasise enough how much the staff and manager need to change. [REVIEW_27] Update; it's been well over a month now; but multiple attempts to get It Can Fit to come fix/replace the couch have failed. They haven't even bothered responding to my review and even if I get them on the phone; I can't rely on them to stick to any appointments they offer.  If you are looking to move soon; my advice would be to find a more professional mover way ahead of time. These guys (ICF) were available last minute and I decided to bite with the lower rate that they quoted; but do yourself a favor and plan your move ahead of time and don't think too much about any slight price difference. It would be worth it to go with a professional moving company. [REVIEW_28] I went there once years ago I believe I cut my order down when the employee went from picking up trash to picking up my bagels No glove; not even paper.. I don;t recall all the details; but my immediate thought was it's another establishment that has no concept of hygiene and exploits the lack of oversight..To top it off; the bagels were far from fresh Needless to say; I haven't been back But I realize many people don't care about cleanliness. If that's you; you'll enjoy this place. [REVIEW_29] Vault of Souls is a $50 cover charge to get into an over-priced bar.  The ""experience"" lasts for 20 minutes unlike the escape room.  You are rushed through and spoon-fed the answers in a pitch-black room. If you want to waste your money and buy crappy drinks; be my guest. I say SKIP IT! [REVIEW_30] The worker was awesome; this is a review for the company.  The price paid isn't in alignment to the service provided; it is just expensive. The worker is still paid hourly; which motivates him/her to work the hours. I believe it is a better way to hire someone off craigslist and pay them to do a service; rather than hourly.",0
11,"[REVIEW_1] I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND !!Late lunch (1:30pm) on Monday 7/16. No more than 4 tables. Seated at a dirty table. Waiter came after about 5 minutes asking if I wanted water (it's Reno!!). Came back minutes later with water and said my glass of wine was ""being poured.""  He wanted to take my order. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich (no onion ). Wine (finally) came right before the food. Fries were stale and cold. Chicken inside of sandwich was so chard it was hard to eat. Waiter NEVER returned until he brought the check. I complained about the quality. Was ""comped"" the sandwich. Never apologized to; nor given any sense of caring. Food was awful; service was inattentive and it was over priced. [REVIEW_2] These people are so RUDE! I will never go there again! They are not helpful and act as though they are too good to help amateur photographers like me! It will be a cold day in hell before they get another dime from me. They need to remember that they are sales clerks and their role is to help the customer! What a bunch of IDIOTS! [REVIEW_3] It seems this place might have been good in the past but has recently been getting worse. I'm not sure if they changed ownership or if the guy that owns it has just gotten tired of having the business but it is definitely not a place to have a good time which is what people intend on doing when they smoke a hookah.  I read reviews on here before going and thought I would never visit this place until a friend of mine invited me.  I was hesitant but he talked me into coming by.  The reviews that speak of racism are correct. If your not white or Indian then definitely don't go here.  (however I am a white woman and still was treated bad; perhaps becasue I came with a lady and not a man? who knows.)  When we walked in the door they told us we had to order to stay but they wouldn't give us time to look at the menu. They stood over us and every 30 seconds were aggressively telling us that we had to decide on something or get out. We didn't order quick enough so they escorted us while yelling at us in their language and making rude gestures the entire way out. The owner continued to curse us as we crossed the street to leave in our car. Someone unknowingly; might think this was just a bad day. After reading others awful reviews it seems this is the norm.   Unfortunate and disappointed [REVIEW_4] Disappointed in management? Ownership? I went to lunch today and service was great; we had a server in training; sweet girl with red hair. Food was perfect; I love the California wrap. This was all made less than perfect by an older gentleman with a black shirt and graying hair. A young homeless man came in and asked for water and I watched this man turn him away. In Arizona. When it was over a hundred degrees out. I'm still trying to understand what I saw. I worked in a restaurant for years and realize sometimes you get ""frequent flyers"" that never order anything and just want water. And because I have a soul; I never questioned it; I got them water and they always left quickly. The homeless gentleman left without making a scene; which was pretty nice. Everyone knows there's a law here where you can't turn someone down for water. I hope Pita Jungle can explain this to me? [REVIEW_5] Finally a local barbecue master with a genuine passion for getting it right. The brisket is to die for... Melt in your mouth slice of heaven made right in Roslyn!!!  Mike knows how to make barbecue pork;ribs;chicken;brisket and cornbread like he grew up in the Deep South where this kind of cooking is religion. Guy Fieri would be calling this joint; ""winner; winner chicken dinner""   Take out or eat in bring your appetite to try the brisket sloo-ow cooked for 19 hours at 190 degrees the best in the area.  Get in early because he sells out. You don't want to settle for a McRib sandwich!!! [REVIEW_6] This sushi restaurant was horrible.  First; when we walked in we were POINTED to our table; not actually walked to it.  No one smiled at us; and we were completely ignored throughout our stay.  We had 3 different people serving us; so we had no idea who our waitress was.  No one explained to us that the only option at ZEN was all you can eat; so when we ordered only 4 small items and received a bill for $56.00; we were astonished.  The waitresses simply ""dumped"" the food to our table....No smiles; no asking who the food was for.  I had to get up from our table to ask for our bill; as we were completely ignored and sat there forever waiting for someone to serve us.  I ended up complaining to one of the waitresses who laughed throughout the few minutes I complained.  DO NOT go to this restaurant....Overall a HORRIBLE experience!!! [REVIEW_7] Extremely rude staff (including management). I had ordered carry out only to return home with the wrong order. My family has dietary restrictions so we could not eat what we had brought home. So I went back to pick up the correct order. When I got there; I told the manager at the front that we had the wrong order. They said they had my order and knew it was wrong. So I asked why they didn't feel the need to notify my or anything that we had the wrong order. The manager began to blame the employees. No apology; nothing. Don't let the renovations fool you. There was no sense of professionalism or quality customer service. I will not be returning to this location. [REVIEW_8] Sadly I am revoking my 5 star review of Gallagher's. I went here last night and asked for their world famous nachos. Guess what; new menu. SERIOUSLY you're going to get rid of the awesome nachos?  No more frosted beer mugs plastic cups. And they also changed the prices on pitchers. PBR now $12 instead of $9. This will not stand.  I would also like to mention the place smelled like a ""radio rock festival"" or cat urine. It looks like Gallagher's is changing for their new lame clientele and they just lost a great customer. [REVIEW_9] Empress Garden has the most authentic Taiwanese food. Their beef noodle soup are painstakingly stewed for 5 hours the day before with various ingredients to get the rich flavor.  In fact I have recently given up vegetarianism for their beef noodle soup. I don't know how that happened but it did. This restaurant is run by the daughter of the owner of a chain of the same restaurants in Taiwan. All of the Taiwanese dishes are flavorful and truly unique to Taiwanese style of cooking. Highly recommend the scallion pancake; beef noodle soup; 3-cup/ flavor chicken; pot-stickers; Shanhaigh Won Ton Soup; and Taiwanese pork meat ball; and oyster pancake. [REVIEW_10] The setting is great; has a modern feel to it. The food is pretty good some of it is a bit spicy. The reason I'm giving it such a low rating is because the waiters there are extremely rude; don't clean; and demand you tip them more after already leaving a 20% tip. [REVIEW_11] This place is complete trash. I just recently bought a 2015 Toyota Corolla s and I got free oil change cards and a bunch of coupons. Charged me $60 for an oil change WITH A FREE OIL CHANGE COUPON; they told me it's high synthetic ow-20 oil so it's gonna be extra. They said it runs $12 a quart; I can buy a 5 quart oil (the exact same they used) at Walmart for $20..?!?! They thought i was an idiot and proceeded to tell me more bogus stuff I needed for my car like a filter (which I knew wasn't even my filter so they switched my air filter out and took mine!) and that I needed new wipers and I had just put new wipers on. They left my pristine clean engine a mess with fluids all over and dirtied my car and changed all the settings inside. So of course a free oil change turned out to be $60 with a recommended $200 for other things. The managers here at the desk WILL RIP YOU OFF. I watched as they did the same thing to everyone else. DO NOT GO HERE!!!! I WARN YOU!!!! [REVIEW_12] Very unhappy with the treatment we received today. After eating a Sushi Rose since it opened up; and their parent restaurant Asian Wok next door; we have never had a sushi chief be so rude and inhospitable. Flower was the acting manager today. She almost permanently lost our business had it not been for the kind service of the waitress. [REVIEW_13] The beignets were so bad that we didn't even eat them. They tasted like fried shrimp and were tough as well. The pralines were gritty; but tasty. Also; the computer/register was down so no drinks available from the bar. We offered to pay cash; but this was beyond their capacity and the request was met with silence. The courtyard was lovely though and the staff courteous. But it was such a disappointment on our first stop of our first day to New Orleans. [REVIEW_14] Availability on a Friday/Saturday night is about the only thing this restaurant has going for it. 15 minutes to take our drink order; another hour until your food arrives (2 of which were kids meals). Broccoli was soggy; premium side spinach was rotten.  Bruschetta topped tilapia had only 8 small pieces of diced tomato on it. Salad bar was pretty much empty.   We've been to this location 4 times in the past year and have consistently left disappointed. Unless they drastically turn things around; we'll never go back. [REVIEW_15] I have had Pizza hut before at a different location and I don't remember the service ever being this horrible. We ordered delivery. They were late; we called them multiple times and the manager would not come to the phone except on the last try. When he finally spoke to us; he blamed us and said we didn't pick up the phone and that he left a voicemail. I immediately knew he was lying since   1. if he called us the multiple times he said we would have received the call 2. if he left a voicemail message THERE WOULD BE A VOICEMAIL MESSAGE  DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS LOCATION. THE MANAGER TRIES TO PLACE BLAME ON CUSTOMERS; LIES AND DOES NOT KNOW WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS!! [REVIEW_16] This place is a disaster in slow motion.  I would avoid this place like the plague.  Most mornings the drive-thru service is so backed up it blocks traffic on Bloomingdale.  The traffic pattern within the property where the location sits is horrible.  Also the service; while my expectations are not high; is extremely slow and often incorrect.  This location is also not owned or operated by Dunkin corporate either; so if you have a problem that management does not resolve at this location; no one at corporate can do anything for you; you are just SOL.  I won't even go here to buy my beans anymore they have messed up that much; DD does have great coffee; but this place can mess that up to and has.  Bad management; no pride of work; and just not worth the time and money. [REVIEW_17] I hadn't really planned on stopping at Edley's because we have some pretty okay BBQ in my city and it's just not really my jam. (Hot chicken over BBQ any day of the week for me) However; we wanted a ""snack"" so we stopped in around lunchtime right before the lunch rush. We got 2 brisket tacos and the daily feature; fried green tomatoes. The food took awhile to get to us; but when it did... holy crap. It was SO GOOD! The tacos were amazing; stuffed full of juicy shredded brisket; pico de gallo; beans; fried jalapenos... maybe more stuff but they were so flavorful and amazing I could barely stand it. And the fried green tomatoes were delicious as well! It ended up being way more food than we wanted for a small snack but we ate every single bite. Well worth it! It got super busy in there and it's definitely in one of the most touristy areas but they have another location you can check out. [REVIEW_18] Couldn't have asked for a better location but horrible maid service and not worth the price. Horrible communication between the staff. The room was nice but didn't include a mini fridge or blow drier. The wi-fi was also a problem. It stopped working and when I asked the front desk about it they told me to call a number.... Which I was on hold for too long with. The pool was heated and had a nice view but one night was hot tub hot and the next was luke warm. Wouldn't recommend this hotel. [REVIEW_19] Went today to look at tackle boxes.  I know it's Christmas; so I expected the crowds.  The problem was the line for Santa went along the wall with the tackle boxes.  There wasn't enough space to see anything except the top shelves; but you could only see them from afar.  The aisle was so narrow to begin with and with everyone in line having a cart it was impossible to look at what I wanted.  Even if I asked someone to move; so I could get closer; it would have been useless since there was no where for them to move there carts.  I just decided to leave and forget making my purchase I had planned on.  As I walked out I told an employee my concern and it seemed like I was bothering her.  She was standing at the exit tell customers; bye. [REVIEW_20] The worst sushi I have ever had. Huge pieces and weird rolls. Tried Bloomingdales role and the other roll that they recommend. Can't be any worse. There's potatoes or something with the roll. Weirdest event had. Strongly not recommend. Don't know how they got such a high review. [REVIEW_21] Staff is friendly. Walters trio enchiladas where terrible and the rice was uncooked; gross. My friends liked the mahi mahi and juicy Lucy burger. [REVIEW_22] Normally; evaluating a fast food chain would be absurd but..Church's Chicken rocks! So much better than KFC and if you are nursing a hangover; this hits the spot. The biscuits are buttery; sweet goodness. Mashed taters and gravy consistency is perfection. The right amount of stiffness without being a brick although I recommend a little salt and pepper to spruce up the taste.  Just like I remember from my Southern upbringing. Do not count calories at this place. And no; I do not make it a habit to hit up Church's on a weekly basis. I consider I nice treat every couple of months. Price is good and service is fast even when there is a line and there usually is a line at this location on Lindbergh in South County. If I am going to do fast food; this is my place of choice. [REVIEW_23] Not impressed at all. Sandwich bar was closed so I ordered a burrito. It was reheated in the microwave; cost 8 bucks; and nasty. Some sort of cream of chicken and old cheese on top. I'm amazed they can sell this and call it food. Could have had better at taco bell. [REVIEW_24] Myron and perma ceram were recommended to me by a contractor/friend.  My tub had some rust and chipping which was explained to Myron when we were scheduling the job.  The price seemed reasonable; so I said okay.  Mike came out a few days later and was a nice guy.  He took a look at the tub and said the repairs would be no problem.  He said he can fix the rust and the tub would look like new. After he was finished and he was paid I was handed a receipt/invoice. Once Mike leaves;  I read what he handed me and at the end it states there is no warranty for rust.  What!  Why wouldn't you say that to me.  I just would have bought a new tub for the price.    Once the tub dried; I could get a closer look and there were several areas it appeared weren't sanded down so there were ridges along several edges.  Not a new tub; so I could live with that.  Fast forward; a couple months went bye and what do you know; I could see the rust coming through. So I call Myron to schedule an appointment and after months of run around; I get a call asking if they can come Christmas Eve. Seriously!  Needless to say they finally said they were too busy to come to the city.  Essentially go pound sand.    Beware. [REVIEW_25] Went here after being told by the owner that they had a taco sale. We were seconds from going I the restaurant next door because of their taco sale; but this guy was rather convincing that his place ""Rotten Ralph's"" had great tacos for sale.  Soon we realized that it was his sad attempt at getting someone to come and eat in his horrible eatery.  The staff were borderline brain dead and had no knowledge of their drinks. One of us ordered a blue moon and it seemed to taste like a colt 45.  I could tell you how horrible the food was and how old the salad must have been. I could tell you how the burger must have been a previously microwaved patty. Or I could tell you about the guacamole that came with the salad. The white guacamole. But I dot think I need to talk about how horrible the food was because it's called Rotten Ralph's....  We should have seen that coming.  I think this place could be good because of the location. It's near a lot of great places.It would make a great toilet.  Oh! And they didn't even have tacos on the menu!  Burn it [REVIEW_26] Yelp doesn't allow to leave 0 star review; so that is why you see one star. Me and my wife are moving from NY to South California; and we contacted 5 different moving companies. I sent my initial email to United Van Lines on 05/02/2018; and soon I got email back with Virtual Survey confirmation for 05/10. The lady that did virtual survey was very meticulous and professional and we ""screened"" through the whole apartment in 15 minutes. No one contacted me after that; so I sent a second email almost a month after; on 06/05 asking if everything is ok; and if I can get the quote. I don't need to mention that other 4 companies sent their quotes in less than 48 hours. Since no one replied til today; I called the direct phone and I left the message on the answering machine. No one called me back. I hope everything is ok; and that no one is hurt; because I don't see any other reasonable explanation why they are avoiding me. Very; very unprofessional. [REVIEW_27] A couple of Saturdays ago; we went to Farmers for breakfast. I ordered the mini-waffle plate... after waiting for quite some time and noticed other diners were receiving their orders after we we had placed our orders first...I asked our waitress; why we were not getting our orders; and she said; ""Shortly"".  Finally; we received our orders and I asked if they had sugar-free syrup and she said; ""No; we don't have it""...then I asked the manager(?) why they don't have sugar-free syrup;and he said; Yes; we do have it"" and brought it promptly....I told him to inform their staff of this product.  I found my waffle very thin and tasteless...not; like the old Farmer Boy restaurant. I also asked why our orders were so delayed and the manager(?) said that they were working on the waffle maker and were also working on the kitchen systems as well...Well; you would think they would have  work out these  problems before opening a restaurant and they have been in this business for many years.  We will not be returning; though I was comp for my meal only. [REVIEW_28] We shop at acme pretty frequently. Today; we accidentally left a bag with a good amount of food in it at the self check out (pasta salad; cheese; etc). We noticed the moment we got home and immediately returned to the store. I also tried calling customer service twice to let them know and it just rang; and rang; and rang with no answer.   Well; when we got back - they were already reshelving our items! My husband had to go around the store and track everything down.   Are you freaking kidding me? You're telling me that they don't even wait for people to return before putting PURCHASED items back to sell AGAIN? There's seriously not a location where they put these items to give the buyers a chance to return?!   It was honestly a span of 20 minutes. That's ridiculous. [REVIEW_29] Printed coupon off their web page just before going. Coupon was beyond its expiration date and they refused to honor it. They either need to fix their site or honor their coupons.  Not too nice about it; either. Need to find some other place where inept teenagers can do a mediocre job for a high price. Will definitely not return here. [REVIEW_30] Muy mal. Servicio y me robaron ordene un pastel para 30 personas y me dieron uno para 10 personas y muy mal sabor y mal decorado tenga cuidado con sus ordenes",4
12,"[REVIEW_1] Terrible. Overrun with pretentious yuppies; babies and dogs. No point in standing in line for small portions that are overpriced. I left and had dinner elsewhere. Good idea; terrible execution. [REVIEW_2] I wish I could give this zero stars; this gave my husband and kid a really really bad stomach ache after eating here. This used to be our favorite Chinese restaurant but not anymore. Never eat here. Also on another note the delivery really slow. [REVIEW_3] After reading reviews we headed for Herbie's for brunch yesterday. 'Sorry to say it was a big disappointment. We waited  15 minutes to place a drink order and it took another 20 minutes for the drinks to arrive. They must have driven to the brewery to get that Bud Light. A Bloody Mary can't possibly take that long to make; can it? Our food was good but lukewarm.  Eggs Benedict just taste better when they are hot.  We won't be back. [REVIEW_4] This is the worst restaurant that I have ever been to. Service is poor. Food is soso. We have to go to another restaurant afterwards to get some real food. I will never come again. I would not recommend it to any of my friends. [REVIEW_5] Absolutely terrible in every aspect.  My fiancé and I came here on a Saturday at 5:45.  All of the waitstaff were standing around the back of the restaurant looking at us awkwardly.  Eventually the bartender greeted us from behind the bar and pointed to the table where we will be seated.  I ordered ""The Cactus"" margarita; and it was salt lime juice and water.  Not a drop of tequila in it.  I'll give it to them that the salsa was good because of the added chipotle.  However; they have the audacity to charge $4 for an extra basket of stale chips.  Our food came out reasonably quick. My fiancé ordered the chicken fajitas and I ordered the 5-Alarm burrito.  Mine was dry as a bone; bland; and not spicey at all.  I'm reasonably sure that they got a frozen burrito from wava and heated it under a panini press.  My fiancée chicken was also dry and just over all bland.  Then came the waiting. We asked our waitress for the check and then she disappeared for 20 minutes.  I asked her again as she passed by our table; and still had to wait another 10 minutes.  It's a different story if they were the only show in town; but this is Main Street manayunk.  There is no reason for places like this to be taking up space if this is the quality and service they are offering. [REVIEW_6] We came here for the first time on a slow Sunday morning but didn't even get to eat. We came for breakfast and waited in line to order for a few minutes. The people in front of us ordered breakfast. Next; when it was our turn; the girl at the counter informed us they do not serve breakfast after 10:30. We looked at the time and it was 10:30 ON THE NOSE. Since breakfast was what we came for; we left. It doesn't seem like they should have had to be so steadfast about their cutoff time. If it was 10:35; I would understand it; or if we weren't already waiting in line before 10:30. I don't think we will be back because this experience left a sour taste in our mouths. [REVIEW_7] I love Roma burgers; I try to have one in every city I visit but this location butchered the Roma burger. Over cooked the usually mouth melting burger so it was tough. Over toasted the bun so it was tough. A shame. Next time I will try a different location. [REVIEW_8] Terrible mixed drinks. Our table got four different drinks and no on like their drink. I got the desert highball and it smelled like the fruit mix was spoiled. On top of that it was just bland; totally watered down. [REVIEW_9] The pizza was horrible had to send it back.. Even though we didn't get a new one they tried charging us for it even though we literally only took a bite.. The server avoided talking to us about it and we had to get her attention and she said she will talk to the manager about it and came back making it seem like they were doing us a favor. I do not recommend this place. [REVIEW_10] One out of three dishes was good. I ordered what was highlighted on Guy's show. The chargrilled oysters were fine. The pizza and the crawfish beignets looked like they should be amazingly delicious; but that fake white American-tasting cheese ruined it for me. End of story. [REVIEW_11] Took the youth group out for a fun night..definitely won't return.    Everything was gross.   Tables were unclean.   Told that food would be done in 30 minutes.   Definitely took almost an hour.   Balls were nasty.  Seriously.  Everything about this place is disgusting.  The chairs are all tore up.   The mini golf needs to be updated.  I went up to ask about about bumpers (we were playing crazy bowl) they refused.  Said that we were too old.  I have 11-13 year olds.  The two lanes next to us had bumpers up and plenty of adults in their 30-40's but because they had 1-2 kids the were allowed to have the bumpers up.   Seriously.  We will never be back.  None of the kids want to come here any more.  Swing around fun town it is.  The icing on the cake was the ""help"" at the front desk.  All 5 guys were just sitting around.  One guy checked us out but had to be a real jerk.  My husband went up to buy 7 mini golfs..one of the workers said ""you gonna pay for that?""  Seriously? [REVIEW_12] I reserved a full sized car. When I arrived at my scheduled time; they had none. The salesman sold me on accepting a Kia Soul; he told me it was the equivalent of full sized vehicle. When I got home; knowing nothing about this vehicle; I did some research. It is classified as a sub compact. So Enterprise took my full payment for a full sized vehicle and completely screwed me. I don't have time to go back to the rental office; so I am stuck paying full price for a sub compact; and I have to use this vehicle for a 1400 mile trip. Never again will I use this rental agency. Don't be like me; do better research and be prepared when they try to screw you over! [REVIEW_13] I ordered a premium flower arrangement from Southtown Florists (formerly Kabloom of Reno) website for Valentine's Day for my fiance. The website shows a rather nicely done arrangement described online as ""Red roses and carnations are exquisitely arranged with white asiatic lilies and chrysanthemums.""   What was delivered to my fiance was a train wreck. The arrangement was a bunch of filler green stuff and those little tiny white garbage sprigs; some carnations; daisies and what appears to be two or three roses. For $90 plus dollars I feel like I was taken; and because of that I won't be using this florist again. If I could submit photos I would; just plain sad. [REVIEW_14] This place was terrible.  We had a muffin out of the case that you could have used to play hockey with.  I had the breakfast nachos and they used a microwave to cook a fake egg. How hard is it to cook a real egg?  Do not waste your money.  I have had better food on a flight in China.  Coffee and smoothly were adequate. [REVIEW_15] Really? $45.00 to ""hold my rate?"" The trick fees and surprise billing that shows up in my checking account every few months is garbage. The monthly fee doesn't sound so bad; but the surprise fees and the $100.00 fee to cancel the account is somewhat discouraging as well.   You can work out here if you're rich and have money to blow; but being a member here has severe financial disadvantages. [REVIEW_16] I would shut this location down. Every drive threw order is 5 min or longer. Who manages this place? I'm done trying to eat there. [REVIEW_17] Never coming back. This is the second we've given then. Tonight; they charged us an extra $5; but was easily correct; not a huge deal. Second; the onion rings tasted like vanilla! We ordered a brownie cookie dough blast and got a cookie dough shake instead; the difference of about a dollar. My shake was missing the middle portion(see photo). The only good thing about this trip was the mozzarella sticks. 2 shakes and 2 sides for $15; no thanks. [REVIEW_18] We got there 30 plus minutes before the show expecting to enjoy a drink or two and some food before the show...were told a server would be right over to help us...no one ever came...so no drinks or food...seats were comfortable but no service took a lot out of the experience. [REVIEW_19] Terrible place with an even worse owner!!! As a former veteran I was deeply offended when my wife and I over heard the owner saying some horrible things about veterans. It took every ounce of energy for me not to lose my temper!! But we left instead to go across the street to much better bar in Bruno's. To sum it all up; he does not appreciate veterans in his bar; so we are happy to help him out with that!! What a piece of work!!! [REVIEW_20] Arrived at 6:55 for a 7pm reservation for 8.  Waited at the host station for 10 mins while servers walked back and forth ignoring our group.  Eventually we were seated at a BBQ table with 2 grills and provided with menus; then the server (who looked miserable to be there) vanished for 20 minutes.  When he returned we were more than ready and began to order only to be advised that the BBQ grills at our table didn't work.!  Wouldn't it have been nice to tell us this when we were seated?  Since 90% of the menu items are BBQ; and that's the reason we came to this restaurant instead of the other local Korean restaurants; we asked to move to a BBQ table that worked.  We waited 15 more minutes and were seated at another table with one grill and placed the order; 7:45 at this point.  All the food came out but many of us  waited eagerly for food since they are grilling for 8 people on one small grill.  Finally everyone is served but then we sit for 20 more minutes waiting for someone to check back; offer boxes or the check.  They actually didn't ever come until one of us got up and requested it and it still took a while.  All in all a disaster of a night and will never go back.  I'd rather skip the BBQ and choose one of the many other excellent Korean restaurants in the area then sit through that again. [REVIEW_21] Rude staff. Food was subpar and greasy. I got a breakfast sandwich and it was greasy and soggy. Coffee was terrible and the espresso machine was out of service. [REVIEW_22] It was a beautiful day and neither my lovely wife nor I had a particular craving; so we popped into this often passed/never visited chainlet. I had eaten a perfectly acceptible brunch at the original location in Baton Rouge and still had very low expectations...they were not met.      The good first: the service was friendfly and efficient.      The bad: poor quality chips; including some tasting of rancid oil; were accompanied with pretty good salsa and truly tasteless queso. Seriously; the jar of queso in the grocey is eons better.      My lenten crawfish quesedillas were okay; but nothing to write home about and they were probably the tastiest thing to hit our table.      My lovely wife had the not at all lovely (to look at...an amalgam of beiges & light browns in amoebic puddles) Rio Grande plate. Bear in mind; Paige is pretty down with standard American-style mexican if it is fresh; but she was pretty underwhelmed.      The crowd was mostly tourists (from out of town or Metairie/Slidell; etc from the looks of it) so perhaps the lovely setting helped them ignore the pallid dreck proffered here; but its walking distance location will in no way seduce into another visit. [REVIEW_23] If you want a hamburger or steak this isn't your joint.  So going to Pita Jungle was not my choice but my soon to be in-law's choice.  The patio is great to sit outside when it gets cooler out; it's laid back atmosphere is very much vegan- tree hugger.  I guess If you like veggies and healthy stuff this is your place to go. Personally me I'm a meat and potato type of gal who isn't your typical ""I'll order a salad and water""   The prices are very reasonable and from what others ordered it appeared the deep friend cauliflower was amazing. [REVIEW_24] Poor service and overpriced hookah. Flavors are from star buzz but charge about 30-50% more than most places. They charge for more coals when they burn out. Food wasn't great either. Definitely wouldn't come here again. [REVIEW_25] HORRIBLE!!! DONT waste your time or money! Been getting acrylics for 15 years and they are the WORST!!! Clueless woman and RUDE AF!  They cut me And made me wait and were rude to me after I waited and had lady start my nails ( while waiting for nail tech) who I know didn't even have a certificate to do nails. [REVIEW_26] I walked in at 9:30 on a Tuesday and the owner told me they were closed. They need to change the hours online and lock the doors when they're closed. [REVIEW_27] Way too hyped up.server was too worried about getting closing work done and left her tables waiting forever .also with a kitchen that's open for everyone to see; maybe they shouldn't touch all the food with their bare hands . [REVIEW_28] I've gotten my hair cut twice now by Ryan. He was the friendliest and cut my hair exactly has described. I will be returning a third time! [REVIEW_29] Weird location...looks like somebody's house..ancient equipment just like the workers. Probably an okay place to take your great grandma for a perm real quik; creepy old guy is the receptionist and barber. Super creepy. [REVIEW_30] This location used to be good; several years ago. About 3 years ago it started to go downhill and now it is just terrible. There were 2 people working on a Saturday evening. Nearly all the tables were full and there were people waiting to order and to pay. The sandwich that was made for me was on hard bread; burnt and barely edible. They need to either shape up or ship out.",1
13,"[REVIEW_1] Tarahumara replaced my favorite Cherokee Mexican restaurant; Siete Luminarias; so they had big shoes to fill.  The menu is small but excellent. The gorditas de harina are outstanding; the chillequiles rock; the salsa is house made and amazing. We haven't made our way through the menu yet; but everything so far has been great.  This is now our new favorite Cherokee Mexican restaurant. A great addition to the street. [REVIEW_2] St. Louis isn't short on fantastic sandwich shops; but Blues City Deli is awesome. They venture into ALL things sandwich combos (even with the well beloved St. Louis favorite pretzel roll) - great; tasty; classics and well-priced. Check out their menu for all their tried and true favorites; or better yet; wait to arrive at the door and check their Daily Special Board. There's no question from the line snaking out (for a quarter mile) of their corner shop; DAILY; hovering over the lucky eaters munching-in on their bench seating outdoors; this is the King of Sandwich Eateries. [REVIEW_3] CLOSED! Super-bummer. It's so awful that Indy cannot support this nice restaurant! [REVIEW_4] We wanted something spicy and fresh and that's exactly what we got. Everything we ordered was great. We have passed this place a million times and never stopped. Great customer service mixed with great food goes a long way. We will be coming back !!!!! [REVIEW_5] This place is magical. Anytime I'm in Nola I make reservations here. The food is always amazing. The pork belly always hits the spot. On a recent visit I tried the Bulgogi; and it didn't disappoint. Try any of their cocktails too. Lastly; the live music sets the mood. I love this place. Everything about it. Go; you will be so happy you did. [REVIEW_6] This is a place you pull up to and question whether you should go in. It's connected to kind of a shady looking motel but don't let that detour you. They have great Mexican food and they guy who runs the place is so nice! They always remember what we like to drink; and since my husband orders the same thing every time they basically just confirm what he wants. Consistently good food with plenty of cheap lunch specials; and inexpensive meals on the dinner menu. Try it! It won't disappoint! [REVIEW_7] Love this place! The owner and staff are friendly and fun; and the food is excellent. I'm from California; but visit Meridian often; and I'm definitely going to be back! [REVIEW_8] Whatever happened around here before; I want to say that I had a great experience with Jamie and Matt. They worked together with others behind the scenes to get me the financing package I wanted and a ton of extras I didn't even expect.  Rather than haggle over price; I came in with a clear idea of the down payment and monthly payment I wanted to achieve. Jamie did the dog-and-pony show of going into the ""back room"" multiple times; but I've seen Fargo so I don't know haha :)  Bottom line; I got the car I asked for with the terms I asked for; plus a bunch of extras like window tint; clear bra; 7 year warranty; and 4 years of free oil changes. All in all; it was a fantastic experience and I'm very pleased with my purchase.  Do I feel like I got a good deal? I think I got a fair deal based on TrueCar and others like that; but more importantly; I feel like I am outfitted with a complete solution that will last me the next 5-7 years without headaches.  Time will tell if everything is true; but for now I am very please with how they handled things.  PS - I did inquire about the negative reviews even recently. They said that a month or two ago they cleaned house and reorganized. They attributed that to the change in service and told me that; yes; if I had come a few months ago; I would have had a terrible experience. So how's that for owning mistakes? [REVIEW_9] Great food!  Texture of everything is melt-in-your-mouth.  The sauces are amazing.  Keep up the good work! [REVIEW_10] Great Service; Great atmosphere and unbelievable toasted raviolis.  Had a great experience; will definitely be back soon. [REVIEW_11] I hurt my back at the gym and was actually pretty worried I really hurt myself but they got me in the next morning and were able to straighten me out. I called around and the pricing; quick service; and location made it an easy choice. Would definitely recommend them to friends and family. [REVIEW_12] I've been a regular at Ekta for the past year or so; and have never had anything less than a 5 star experience.  Wait staff is attentive; and the food quality is top notch. [REVIEW_13] Someone must've known it was birthday because The Voodoo Bone Lady herself was our tour guide for my group! Me and my group did the 8 o'clock in the evening 5 in 1 Haunted tour. The Voodoo Bone Lady demonstrated great knowledge in the haunted history of New Orleans. She was also very funny and entertaining. I also loved how she handled a major distraction (a huge wedding party second lining down the middle our tour) which she turned around an included some history of that. My group and I had such a wonderful time. I highly recommend this tour! [REVIEW_14] Best pho in Santa Barbara County.  Staff are great.   I drive 35-40 minutes for the Pho; would drive double.   Seriously tho; no more pho withdrawals.       Thanks Phamous! [REVIEW_15] So thrilled to find this delightful shop! I purchased a kit with yarn and pattern; but had some problems with the directions. A phone call to the store cleared them up quickly by the helpful lady who answered. Awesome. [REVIEW_16] The reviews are true this is a great salon! I read about it here on yelp and decided to try it out. I usually only get my nails done for special occasions and always have some sort of problem- crappy polish job; bleeding cuticles; sore feet or legs from too hard scrubbing and the language barrier has been an issue for me a few times as well. The Salon itself was clean and organized which is an important thing most salons don't take seriously. Anna was amazing - she not only understood ( language and meaning) what I wanted but went above and beyond to make it better and seemed genuinely happy too. She was fast; experienced and outgoing. Nothing more I could ask for. Oh and they don't overcharge here either! $50 for a gel mani and regular pedi. Will definitely return here !! [REVIEW_17] My Aunt and I stayed here for a few nights in December.   The location is GREAT being very close to State St.; pier; zoo etc..  The staff was AMAZING!! The girls who work in the front were extremely helpful; even offering us local family owned options for dining. The chef; Jenny does an amazing job with feeding 50+ people a day. She was very friendly; and she's an amazing local chef.   Parking is kind of crummy; but we ended up always getting a spot.  Parking on the street is allowed on weekends; with a permit (which the inn does not provide) The inn offers free bike rental! How great is that!! I was very pleased with the Inn and will be back again for sure! [REVIEW_18] Very Informative; took us to haunted places (that we were planning to see anyways) and gave us funfilled stories behind each place. Kept us listening all night! [REVIEW_19] I LOVE This Restaurant!!!! It may not have the widest selection of food; but the fries are off the chain! And the drinks are marvelous! [REVIEW_20] My father and sister had been there many times - with all their problems. The staff - doctors; nurses; technicians have all been wonderful; helpful and knowledgable. This past week and half my father had been in hospice there. I can't say enough about the staff there. They are amazing - its not just the training; but these caregivers put their hearts out there. They all take the time to learn about the family; they understand our desires; and take care with explaining all the details. They are absolutely the most compassionate group of people I have ever met - I can't thank them enough!!! [REVIEW_21] Just had my first Panera delivery experience and it was great! The delivery was on time and the nicest delivery guy I've ever met delivered my lunch! He was friendly and polite and seemed like he was having his best day ever! Max delivered great food with a contagious smile! Good stuff Panera! [REVIEW_22] Sally is great! She really takes her time and I can tell she genuinely cares to give a quality cut. Been to countless barbershops that charge a ridiculous amount for a ""supercuts"" haircut but at players you'll walk out with a quality cut for a reasonable price. [REVIEW_23] Delicious! I got the special; fried green tomato sandwich; my husband got the deluxe; mother-in-law got french dip. We also got a bacon pizza. It was all good.  The only thing I didn't like was the pasta salad side...had too much olive flavor and I don't like olives so I guess if you like olives you may like it.  Wished I wasn't so ful as I would have liked to try the desserts. [REVIEW_24] This is my kind of joint!  Cozy; great atmosphere; and the staff have been nothing but excellent to me. I love their mini pizzas. One of my servers even made me an off menu dirty vodka martini and prepared the cheese stuffed olives for me fresh...wow! Kale chips rocked also; loved the tangy yogurt dip. They have a live piano player some nights; totally classy and he was quite talented. Lilly's is the kind of place St Louis City deserves. Check them out. [REVIEW_25] I had the WORST experience at this nail salon. I am not a local; visiting SB at the time. My cousin and I went to get our nails done; and I was simple just getting a polish change. The ""technician"" was an older woman; which is fine but she was very rude; unfriendly; sharp; and rough when grabbing my hand. She attempted to paint my nails; but it was pretty awful. It was a quick and sloppy job that she wanted to charge me $10 for. I asked to speak to the manager; just to see if I would get a discount or what; cause I really did not want that lady to re-do her poor job as she was very rude. The manager refused to speak to me face to face; but I could see her in the back. The woman who did my nails became upset very quickly and attempted to grab my hand and force me to let her re-do her first job. It was SO unprofessional; and at this point everyone in the salon was looking at this situation. I just wanted to leave and gave them the money. I have NEVER felt so mistreated at a business; and felt that the manager should have made more of an effort to make sure the customer left somewhat satisfied. I WOULD NOT recommend visiting this salon. [REVIEW_26] Fantastic customer service both wholesale shopping and auto services. My tire was flat once and the mechanics went above and beyond (truly!) trying to fix it but eventually I had to get it repaired at a full service shop. The Costco employee felt bad and even offered to partially reimburse me for something that broke when they were trying to fix my tire (I turned them down but it's the thought that counts!). I will never forget how kind and hard they were trying to help me!  Saturdays and Sundays are the days my boyfriend and I like to shop here because of all the delicious samples. The employees are all helpful; cheerful; and respectful. Place is clean; you'll find bargains; and produce is fresh and generally more healthy than what you find elsewhere. Some of the generic Costco (Kirkland signature) items are just as good if not better than brand names.  Best of all; I hear you don't even need a membership to eat at their food court with bargain prices. $1.50 for a hotdog and a drink with free refills? $10 for a delicious WHOLE 18"" pizza? Too good to be true and yet it is!  With competitive prices; gas prices usually the lowest on gas buddy; and membership perks; such as travel getaway packages; I found I have always made back my membership fee and then some with the end of the year reward coupon. Can't say enough good things about this place and the company. Big fan! [REVIEW_27] The only reason I mentioned the media or attorney was out of frustration after he would not provide the owner's contact info so I could appeal to her about keeping the area clean and cleaning or painting the columbarium.  That older area that is out of sight has been that way for years but we finally got tired of it and complained.  He never admitted it could be cleaned up.  As for the vase; I didn't demand just one for my Dad.  I stated he should replace the cheap plastic vases on ALL the niches as they were falling off and disintegrating.  There are not very many of them. I simply thought it would be the right thing to do.    If there was empathy; I did not hear it. [REVIEW_28] Always a wonderful experience.  We never stay anywhere but the Peppermill because the hotel is consistently outstanding.  The rooms are beautiful; the staff is extremely professional and the restaurants are excellent.  The Peppermill gives you the Las Vegas experience without the long trip. . . and without the ridiculous crowds.  (Now if only I could learn how to win on the slots)  LOL [REVIEW_29] My husband and I stayed in Germantown section of Nashville and ate breakfast both days during our stay....the staff; the food; the attention to detail was TOP NOTCH!!!! We sat At the little bar they have and enjoyed watching the hustle bustle of the staff who showed true southern hospitality to each other and the patrons!!!  I highly recommend the butter pecan pancakes!! NO frozen home fries here!! Amazing smooth French roast coffee.... Loved this place!! [REVIEW_30] I'm surprised at how sleep at the wheel the Snyders became. Bobby Clark destroyed our team as a GM. Fluxuated old Flyers technique around the NHL; and trapped us with nontradeables tied to long and nonbreakable contracts; in fact I never seen the guy score; personally. Our history has better Emric players than that guy. OFF WITH HIS HEAD",28
14,"[REVIEW_1] How can something so simple become so hard?   Ducked into Mr. B's for a quick lunch at the bar. I ordered a Mr. B's luncheon salad (dressing on the side) and a catfish fingers app. The salad came WITH dressing; the overly loquacious bartender was at the far end of the bar; regaling diners there with the tale of his losing another customer's credit card earlier in the day; and despite my efforts; I was unable to get his attention. So; I ate the dressed salad. Twenty minutes later; the bartender finally came by; and asked if I had received the catfish fingers. I had not.  The bartender ducked into the kitchen; came back; and assured me that a fresh order of catfish was being made for me. Waited (in vain) for another 30 minutes. When I had been waiting a total of 50 minutes and had still not received my food; I asked for a check (minus the catfish) and a manager. The manager heard my story and professed to be astounded; and he assured me he was going to investigate in the kitchen as to what went wrong. Then he jumped up and left.  Anytime that I've experienced a restaurant malfunction of this magnitude; I've been offered some measure of hospitality. Neither the bartender nor the manager cared enough to offer me a drink; a dessert; or any other compensation for the time I wasted trying to have a simple lunch. What a supreme disappointment from what I thought was a high caliber operation. [REVIEW_2] Excellent food and service. I had a Salmon and my friends a Burger. Sloan was our waitress and advised us from beers; wine all the way to our full meal. There was a two piece band that was a nice addition. This is a must for anyone.  Bonnie from San Diego [REVIEW_3] My dryer went out on the coldest day of the year. I had to quickly find a laundromat to wash and dry. Yolanda; the onsight attendant; could tell I was a newbie. She took the time to tell me which washers would work best for me; told me how much detergent to use and was right there to help me with the dryers. She keeps the place clean; constantly mopping the floor and cleaning off the machines. The atmosphere is very comfortable. I would highly recommend it if you ever find yourself in need of a laundromat! [REVIEW_4] Love this place!  Stopped in for a drink and a snack on Valentine's Day.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  We sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender a bit.  Loved the decor and the fact they only show 80s movies on their TV.  We had beef fat fries - life changing - so good! Overall great experience! [REVIEW_5] Pros: I was able to make a sameday appointment for both my sister and myself. The woman running the front desk was very welcoming and was expecting us. I had told her on the phone that I wanted a strong deep tissue massage and she hooked me up with a really fabulous young woman. It was one of the best massages I've ever had. I really liked that she asked me what I wanted. She tailored the massage to my needs (neck and shoulders) rather than going through the motions and doing my whole body. My sister and I had massages in the same room at the same time; and it was nice that we could do that.   Cons (I'm extremely picky and mostly pointing this out to help Massage Envy; not to dissuade): I did not love how the receptionists are at the front desk loudly making confirmation calls while you're sitting waiting for the massage therapist. But My sister wasn't as thrilled by her massage person. There were only enough hooks for one person's stuff in our double room.Our therapists chatted amongst themselves a bit more than we would have preferred.   Overall; highly recommended! I am a member; so I can get my massages at the local member price; which in Tampa is pretty low. It's a bargain for a lovely service! [REVIEW_6] I love this place! Good; fresh food with seasonal options available to keep things exciting and not expensive. Good vibes in the restaurant and the staff are very helpful and kind. Wine Wednesday's are also a plus! [REVIEW_7] Le Chandelier Salon and Boutique offers quality service and expertise that will blow you away. From my wedding trial to my wedding day; I have nothing but positive words to say. Le Chandelier's hair/makeup artists are wonderful!! They came to our venue the morning of our wedding and their professionalism and creativeness was remarkable. Thank you to the owner and to all of the staff for making the day such a calm and relaxed atmosphere. I highly recommend their services to anyone! [REVIEW_8] The staff is wonderful; the coffee is great; and the concept is different. An Indonesian cafe right in the heart of fishtown! [REVIEW_9] Me and my boyfriend stopped here traveling through Riverway and it was the best decision we made all weekend. We had the fried tofu as an appetizer and we both had the chicken pad Thai. The food was fresh; made from scratch and so tasty. It wasn't greasy at all and didn't give that full bloated feeling afterwards. The service was impeccable and the prices were great for the portions. There is also a separate vegan menu! We will be returning! [REVIEW_10] When I'm in SB I Always make a stop here for some great food. Had  beef and broccoli and it was delicious.  Full of flavor and good portion.  Like to be my own critic because everyone has different opinions about food.  Will definitely come back. [REVIEW_11] Tried this place out with a coworker for lunch and loved it. The setting is modern; rustic and comfortable. Tables offer decent privacy and sitting at the bar you have a front row seat to the kitchen and can watch your meal being prepared. The feed is flavorful and fresh! I had the chicken schwarma with lamb bacon. I substituted lettuce for the alfalfa sprouts and it was delicious! I also tried the crispy beets; they were good though surprisingly a little spicy. I love spice so it was a pleasant surprise for me. My coworker had the burger which looked heavenly; he also had the sweet potatoes topped with sweet potato chips. I tried it and immediately had food envy. I'll be getting that next time. Definitely recommend; two thumbs up. [REVIEW_12] Hands down the best white pizza I've ever had. The Fireside salad is also one of my favorites. [REVIEW_13] I love the food; love the owner the lady who waits on you is so lovely and so warm. Chicken Makhani was excellent and Chicken Kashmir was amazing my friend and loved it don't worry about the decor the food is the best Indian around....7/14 Update: They opened up another space next door nicer decor but the prices went up too. However; the food is still excellent; the owner is still lovely and warm and I don't get to eat Indian very often with dinner companions so the expense is a ice treat for me. The old space is now a grocery store. [REVIEW_14] Very good! The food was fabulous. We both had the specials-- pork burger for me and New York strip for him.  We will be back. [REVIEW_15] I'm very displeased with my experience here the girl up front was very rude when I went up to the bar to get some drinks I was not carded when my friends who are african American went up right after me they were carded which they were already carded up front so I don't understand why they were carded twice and I was only once I think that was very racist of them the workers there just make you feel uncomfortable for being there i had such high hopes for this place I am so let down I will not be returning [REVIEW_16] Love love love this place for HH n dinner is good too! Its ok for brunch; not as great as what people praise it to be. The Asian Nachos are the dish to get for HH. Its an entree itself! The other HH dishes are great too. The creme brulee is amazing as with their other desserts. The blueberry mojito is awesome along with the mango sling. Great place to celebrate birthdays and such.  Nice feel to it. Bar area gets crowded as it gets later for HH. As usual around the mall; finding parking sux! [REVIEW_17] Cupcakes are amazing and I love that they have a gluten free option! Anytime I need cupcakes I will order through here. The staff was so friendly and patient with my questions. [REVIEW_18] They've yet to get even my most basic of orders right (iced black coffee); and when I do order specialty coffees; they suck. I ask for extra espresso every time and even though they'll charge me for it; they rarely add it. Specialty Lattes? They'll taste like mostly milk. Service is also mediocre. They will give me the correct drink if I drive back; but who wants to have to drive back every time? Not to mention it comes with a side of attitude.   Whoever is running this place; please get it together. [REVIEW_19] We called Sierra Air on February 24th Saturday for them to check our thermostat to furnace was not working.  Sierra Air came within the hour and cleaned the furnace sensors and all was well.  We bought our home a couple years ago and this was the first time we had the furnace serviced; now we know to have it serviced annually; especially for all the Safety Sensors.  The Serviceman was very polite and answered all our questions.  Thank You Sierra Air! [REVIEW_20] I enjoyed my lunch at Luke's. The service was superb and the food was delicious. We could taste the love and thought process that the chef created to inspire our palate of the quality of food that Luke's is awarded in New Orleans and in the USA. [REVIEW_21] Everything has been a breeze with Dr. Poblete! We are so happy with the personal contact; she is easily accessible; talk to her and only her about the health of our child by phone anytime pretty much. She has been meticulous with all of her advice and support for our child. We never feel rushed and honestly very refreshing to have access to her whenever we need to talk. We are beyond pleased with her as our child's pediatrician and the wonderful staff make our visits even more effortless. Highly recommend! [REVIEW_22] Their pizza is pretty good; service is usually cool inside. But today I ordered a delivery for the first time; the driver was very insulting to me. When I open my door she asked me about a car across the street with a guy in the driver's seat. I replied ""I don't know;"" she said ""cus I don't wanna be set up to get robbed"". Mind you I already paid with my visa when I ordered; her behavior made me feel awkward as if I had done something wrong. I gave her the tip I had in my hand and said thank you; hoping that maybe if I remain polite she'll stop thinking so negative I just wanted some pizza not to be judged because of my surroundings or to be stereotyped. [REVIEW_23] Was taken here today by a Colombian friend who needed to satisfy a craving for something cheap and delicious. This place reminds me of Nanzhou; a Yelp favorite; because of the heaping helpings you get for next to nothing.   I got the oxtail soup (Sancocho) with extra rice and plantains to see how it would differ from the Korean-style stuff I was used to at home. Aside from a thicker; stew-like broth and beefier potatoes; it was just as delicious. My friend got a flat steak (Carne Asada) that I think he ate in just under 10 seconds.   Remember Yelp; you're missing out on a lot if you don't visit NE philly once in a while; especially this place. [REVIEW_24] Amazing food; cheap and BYOB. Come early to avoid the lines. I would recommend the curry mussels for apetizer! [REVIEW_25] This place is NASTY! . Floors; booths; sides of booths are caked with old food. Service was slow at best. Baked potato tasted like it had been baked 3 days ago. Will NEVER go there again. [REVIEW_26] I went to this place on a business trip so I didn't really have to worry about the bill...which only made this place better! They let you bring in your own alcohol which was pretty cool; unfortunately we didn't find out until we realized they didn't have a drink menu so we ordered; ran to the nearest liquor store; and by the time we got back my soup had gotten cold :( My fault though.As for the main food; we got some sushi and it was friggen delicious!   Let me start you off with this; I hate raw fish...I have an aquarium with my own pet fish and sushi just makes me think I could eat them...BUT i went into this place with an open mind. I tried to order as much cooked fish sushi as possible; so that meant crab; lobster; and smoked salmon. I did get a little spicy tuna in there too but only because the rest of the group loved it. Long story short; I loved every bite; the lobster rolls were delicious; and we got some firecracker roll with lobster; spicy tuna; and some crunchy stuff (ginger?) on top of it... that was the best sushi flavor/texture combination i have ever had!  Again...I didn't pay for the meal; so that may have influenced my rating a little. For 3 people our total was about $100; and we did get a lot of food. [REVIEW_27] I've been ordering mostly take out and delivery from here for about 2 1/2 years.   As far as quick Chinese food goes; can't say enough good things.   First- the people who own it and work there daily are always incredibly nice and polite.  The food is great; meat is tender and veggies are very fresh and the shrimp are decent size. Portions are a good value .  The menu is a little more limited than a more upscale fine dining Chinese place but better than most fast food Chinese places.   Sometimes they do offer specials that aren't on the regular menu.   An extra nice feature is if I'm too lazy to leave the house; that they deliver!   Anyway; like I said above; I can't say enough good things about this restaurant and the folks who run it. [REVIEW_28] Austin  Martinez (director of operations) & Steven (our server) went above and beyond with our table. Awesome guys and great atmosphere. Made our Friday night experience wonderful. My friends and I will definitely be back to this great clayton spot! [REVIEW_29] This is a must stop for my family shopping!  I have learned that when you see it; get it or it may not be there next time.  This is especially true with seasonal items! [REVIEW_30] Amazing gluten free Acai bowl. I just got almonds instead of the granola. What an amazing concept for a restaurant. I highly recommend going here - very healthy; very fresh and you can tell they are proud of what they serve. Very unique and worth a trip.  www.glutenfreechickie.com",25
15,"[REVIEW_1] Great food. Did take out for our first ever order. Amazing food!  The Meing Cum sounds weird but was one if the best things I've ever had. Chicken satay was great too. Will definitely be ordering again. My husband can't stop raving about the Drunken Noodles. [REVIEW_2] Not sure why this place was listed as being closed as the wife and I stopped here tonight on our way back home through Delaware and we had the BEST time. The lady who works there (who I believe owns the store with her husband) is extremely friendly and helpful and the store is magical. They have a newly made +18 mini-section filled with naughty goodies (pillows; doujinshi; inexpensive scrolls that'll make you blush) and a surprisingly extensive amount of merch like full scale figures and little plushes/keychains. They have fun things like an archway to string up tanabata wishes and a little lottery to win prizes. It's like every anime fan's dream home and a truly lovely place; we'll be back! [REVIEW_3] I recently went to Ame for a hair cut and wedding makeup trial run. The salon looks lovely; and would have been much more pleasing if the receptionist had smiled; or offered a welcome. Neither were given. Though my hairdresser was polite; there was no genuine friendliness. The cut turned out OK; but not jaw dropping. I won't be harsh about the cut because I mentioned I didn't want to cut it too short because I'd like to keep it long for my wedding which is in October. She had asked if there was anything I was looking for and I replied with 'just a trim; unless you have suggestions'. She had no suggestions which I usually mark as characteristic of a hairdresser that either isn't creative or doesn't enjoy their job. I let it go though; and thought I'd wait till after my hair was dried before making my final judgment. The Blow out was horrible; even I could have done a better job than she did. I usually love the blow outs I get after my hair is cut because the hair is smooth and full of body. My hair was flat and boring. I had considered having her do my hair for my wedding but decided that if she couldn't do a decent blow dry she probably couldn't do an up do.  Once the cut was completed she took me to the front to check out. When I told the receptionist I had an appointment for make up she said 'Oh. Well; I don't see it and there isn't anyone here to do it. Do you want to make an appointment for another day'? When I scheduled the appointments I confirmed that I wanted both; and when I told there wouldn't be a problem I assumed both were booked. I had even told the woman booking the appointments that I live out of STATE and am only up on some weekends. I will not rebook any appointments with Ame; fearing that I would make a three hour trek to be told 'sorry- it didn't make it on the books'. Not worth the visit- unfriendly staff; poor service; and unreliable scheduling make this salon the worst I have ever visited! I'll be finding another salon once my move to PA is final. [REVIEW_4] Definitely one of the best beer selections I have seen in many places. The wings were delicious all of the food that I saw go by looks to be very good. Mostly I was there for the beer selection and the wings.  It is a good place that offers a variety of seating and the employees seem to enjoy working there for the most part. I have very good service from the bartender. [REVIEW_5] I wish I could give this zero stars; this gave my husband and kid a really really bad stomach ache after eating here. This used to be our favorite Chinese restaurant but not anymore. Never eat here. Also on another note the delivery really slow. [REVIEW_6] This place is great; even for vegetarians.  The food is fresh and delicious.  The sauces are fantastic.  The staff are courteous and helpful.  My daughter and son-in-law live in nearby Lansdale and it seems as if we stop here for a meal at least once every time we visit them. [REVIEW_7] I was excited to try this place. Decided to meet a friend for a late lunch. The C House says they open at 2:00 in Saturday's. They were open. We ordered. Waited 15 minutes then the waiter appeared saying they were not prepared to serve food. They weren't ready at 3:00 either. No manager came by. Nothing. We left. Total disappointment. Don't open at 2:00 if you can't serve food. Ridiculous. [REVIEW_8] I was just visiting St Louis/Clayton for a business trip. I was referred to Sauce on the Side by a colleague. It is amazing to say the least. The food is fresh and creative. I ate there 3 times that week! Super friendly staff. They even gave me the low down on the local beers!  Love 4HandsBrewing by the way! [REVIEW_9] Great sandwiches. The people are friendly; the bread is great; the sandwiches are amazing!  Order the primo and you won't be disappointed !! [REVIEW_10] I didn't use to frequent the market often but my coworker made me go after work one day and now it has become our Friday treat after a long day at work!!! The chicken enchiladas are AwESOME!! No really!!! I'm hooked and the southwest chicken salad is good hot or cold; and bc I spread the word I have to buy it weekly before my mother in law gets it's; there nice here always helpful!! We tried the chicken taqutios today. Guess what. Also good. We will be back again n again great flavor:) [REVIEW_11] Probably the worst haircut experience I've ever had. Trimmed my beard against my request and it came out very uneven. Took FOREVER. Workers were extremely inconsiderate. Definitely do not go here. [REVIEW_12] I've wanted to check out Delicia for so long! When a friend and I decided to head out for dinner during Devour Indy; I was so glad to see them on the list! The guacamole they served as an appetizer was great; I'm a guac lover; and the pistachios added a really nice flavor to it. We both chose the salmon; and fell in love with this dish. The salmon was perfectly cooked; juicy and flaky. The polenta was amazing. I left wishing I had ordered another to have the next day! It was nice having the signature drinks included with dinner. He chose the sangria and I chose the margarita. Both were very good. I'll definitely be back to Delicia for dinner again. This place was a great choice! [REVIEW_13] Pathetic experience with them. I ordered for rava masala dosa and vegetable uttapam to take out. They gave me dosa which is as good as burnt. Packing was so bad that the dosa layer has stuck to the white sheet of wrap. It did not smell good either. I called them and explained the story. I was expecting an apology and someone to provide us with the replacement if not refund but nothing of the sort. They did not even apologize; forget about refund or replacement. i shall be disposing the dosa as is. Uttapam was not very good either. It tasted sour and cilantro seemed old. I could not take it more than few loaves. Remaining will go in the dustbin as well.  Such a disgusting experience with them [REVIEW_14] Amazing. Sous vide pork chop was everything I hoped it would be. Best creme brûlée I've ever had. [REVIEW_15] Food is overpriced and mediocre. For the same price we could have gone to Commander's or Brennan's and could have got amazing food for the same price. Food here is beyond average. [REVIEW_16] While they do have the hottest wings I've ever tried (i like everything hott hott hott); there's just too much grease for this stomach to handle..and just me..my stomach is made of iron.  My inlaws really enjoy the teri wings and eat it weekly.  Wish there was a way they could clear their arteries. [REVIEW_17] Highly; highly overrated.  The food was a C minus at best.  And the service was so bad that I may never go back.  They screwed up my order completely and my no apologies.  There are a lot of other options around State Street.  Avoid this place like the plague. [REVIEW_18] Stopped by on my way out of Nashville for a quick bite. Mistake. As soon as I walked in the manager made an offensive comment about my appearance (I have long hair and a beard so she referred to me as ""baby Jesus"") Not a good start.  Food quality was very poor even for a buffet; and the stock was extremely low on everything; and what was there was cold and unpleasant. Drinks never were refilled.   I tried to salt my food and discovered not one; but all salt shakers were caked with water and unfunctional. When I asked the server for fresh salt she proceeded to check the tables and came back several minutes later with what she claimed was ""the best she could find"" rather than making a fresh bottle; and it was just as caked as the others.   If I had to say one positive thing about it; I'd say that I'm 90% positive that the steak was made from actual beef!   Do yourself a favor and never go here. [REVIEW_19] Service and food was absolutely HORRIBLE. Waited in the drive thru for a half hour before I could even roll up to have my order taken because the staff was serving out food so slow. Then once I finally got to where you place your order; I had to wait for 5 more minutes before anyone took my order. Then I had to repeat myself 3 times before they could hear my order and they didn't apologize for the wait or at least explain the situation. Then once I finally got the the window nobody even apologized for making us all wait for horribly long time. Once I finally got my food and it was cold as could be; the meat on my burger was dry; and had NO toppings on it and the buns were dry and hard. Worst service I have EVER HAD. Staff was rude and food was horrible; cold and dry [REVIEW_20] DISCLAIMER: this review is limited exclusively to my single experience last night eating prawn mee noodle soup at Penang.  Review: this dish was admittedly very fishy; which I was generally okay with. It almost tasted like the restaurant added fermented shrimp paste or something similar. That's also not an issue; in itself. However; it is now 8pm; and I have still not yet left my hotel room since getting back from Penang last night. I'm currently having the absolute worst food poisoning experience of my life.  According to my primary care physician; aka WebMD; it is likely that I have some form of aggressive salmonella food poisoning.  The other dishes looked good; and I'm sure the prawn mee is typically not vomit/diarrhea-inducing; but i hope this issue is addressed promptly. [REVIEW_21] Very disappointing customer service here. Seems like the employees are too busy running around restocking shelves to actually assist customers. Looks like the issue is poor management. I prefer clothing stores that focus more on customer service than stocking shelves. [REVIEW_22] Tonight I was really disappointed. I called and placed a take out our about 45-1hr prior to closing. I ordered a chicken Fajita and chicken enchiladas with chips and dip. The only thing right was the chips and dip; if you count that each chip was broke then maybe not. I should have taking pics of this mess I was given but I was to upset once I drove all the way home only to realize my order was WRONG and MISSING.. had no black beans and rice or sides for my enchiladas. You could barley see any cheese. I called immediately and spoke with the manager and was told that the enchiladas would been taken off my bill. No dinner than I hung up and opened the burrito I noticed I had no fajita peppers... none just rice beans and chicken..  I immediately called back. The manager agreed that the orders were wrong and she apologized and asked if I was close she would have the order remade; and take the entire order off my bill. Since I was feeding more than myself; I decided that I would return for the remade order so my teenager would eat tonight as planned. Well.. I drive 10 minutes back and get my remade order and another apology. The worse part about this is I should have cut my losses... but this is the same place that I hosted by friends Bridal shower in the private dining hall and the service was amazing; this is the same place that I have come for happy hours but tonight I should have said NO!! Get home and bam.. burrito smelled great looked great but NO Chicken.. NONE.. just beans; peppers; rice and cheese even tasted the cilantro but Where is the Chicken?? I didn't bother to call back this time. I'm gonna just cut my losses and not go back. Not a good feeling when you really want something tasty to get and get turned off Twice!! My nephew agrees.. he just went to Wendy's. Now I hope my refund is correct. Seems likely the next problem. [REVIEW_23] Don't do business with this ""company"".  They don't respond to emails or phone calls. In fact; they don't even have a voicemail set up so it just rings to no avail. I ordered a product along with 2 day shipping.  I waited the 2-3 days processing time and emailed to inquire for tracking number. Nothing. Called over and over. For an establishment that sets such strict guidelines on no refunds; high restocking fees and also threatens they will seek monetary damages if you file a pay pal claim; you would think they would follow their own rules.  As soon as I filed a claim with PayPal they responded and refunded my money. How difficult is it to communicate with your customer?  It's a fraudulent business in my opinion and PayPal should discontinue doing business with them. [REVIEW_24] The ambience and food are great. I enjoyed the old village Lebanese style architecture. The food was on the expensive side but definitely well worth it for the quality. I highly recommend the home made drinks especially the homemade jallab. I'm looking forward for the restaurant to open [REVIEW_25] If you order the same type of meals they will make a meal for one and split the amount of meat with the 2nd platter. Yes they always short you out of your meat. Why the heck did we only have one strip of grilled chicken for each wrap. This is not the first time this happened either. Don't even bother to tip them because you will still be hungry and will have to eat again to satisfy your stomach.       When we all order separate meals or separate types of meals; we get the correct amount of meat and fries. Idiots [REVIEW_26] I've been going to this location for over four years and have never had a unsatisfied experience. I highly recommend this location!  Great rates & the customer service is amazing! 5+ Stars!! [REVIEW_27] Unbelievable! The best breakfast I have ever had in my life!!!! The atmosphere was quaint and cozy; the staff was delightful and friendly and the food was out of this world. Breakfast is my favorite meal and I always enjoy going out but since moving to the south my breakfast journeys have been sorely disappointing.  I found The Garden via Yelp and I am so thankful!!! I don't eat beef or pork so many fudged are out of the realm of possibility for me; but not here! Turkey ham and cheese omelette!! Yum! Boyfriend has turkey sausage fiesta omelette! Yum! And we shared the amazing Bananas Foster pancakes; yum!!! This was the holy grail of breakfast!!!! [REVIEW_28] A favorite hang out. Our ""go-to"" place. Good service and a wonderful selection of fresh food and drinks! [REVIEW_29] Review for HOTEL only Stayed here on a stop over on the way to Vegas. It's right off the I-80 east but not close enough to hear any freeway noise. The room was clean; quiet and everything worked. Hot water; water pressure; A/C and heat worked. The bed was comfortable. I was on the 3rd floor and couldn't hear my neighbors through the wall at all. The only noise came from under the door; standard for most hotels I suppose; but nothing too bad. The quality of the stay in terms of the price is unbeatable. The room was $47 on a Sunday night. I'm sure it might be slightly higher for the weekend. The room is dated in terms of furniture but if that is not a big deal(which it isn't for me) then the stay is well worth the price. Included are some photos and there was some patchwork in the shower but again; I don't think that's a big deal. I will stay here again [REVIEW_30] Never fails; this place is awesome. My personal faves tend to be the biscuit and the savory Dutch baby (regardless of toppings).",15
16,"[REVIEW_1] Great place for dinner!! Had to wait bc it was the weekend but food was good & gator tail was delish!!! Walking distance from our hotel was great bc there wasnt any parking when we were there it was super busy! [REVIEW_2] India Palace has saved my life several times; both due to its easily accessible location in the International Marketplace just off 65; and the fact that it opens for dinner starting at 5pm.  They also have FIFTEEN vegetarian entrees; plus a super delicious vegetable biryani.  Once seated you will be treated with water; menus; a basket of papadum; and an assortment of chutneys (mint; onion; and tamarind) which you will happily devour while deciding what to order.  What you should get: *GARLIC NAAN (if you don't try this without a very good reason; I will probably unfriend you) *Paneer chilli (delicious cheese cubes in a rich; spicy; tomato-based sauce - my favorite) *Nav ratan korma (veggies cooked with herbs; cashews; raisins - also fantastic) *Aloo mattar (peas and potatoes with a spicy sauce - my potato-loving husband's go-to dish)  The staff are very helpful and I've taken their advice on several occasions when I've been overwhelmed by the options - it's good advice.  Munch on! [REVIEW_3] Suzie was awesome! Great location; comfortable atmosphere; quick and friendly service. Looking forward to being a regular client from now on! [REVIEW_4] The hazelnut sponge cake is the best around. Def worth the price and its always fresh. [REVIEW_5] Great people great ice cream Patricia makes the ice cream from scratch.... make sure you check it out [REVIEW_6] Visited on 12/16/14 We have tried this restaurant location under various management.  So when we saw it was open once again; under a new name we wanted to give it a chance.  We will not be going back.  We did get carry out; so we gave some slack on the mushy; greasy onion rings; and the Texas toast.  But my husband ordered the brisket and rib platter and I ordered the 1/2 chicken.  The ribs were just ok; the brisket was an end piece and was burned and inedible.  The chicken was more the size of a Cornish game hen and had little meat.  They gave 2 small containers of BBQ sauce which was not enough.  We both asked for cole slaw; but got potato salad.  The cowboy beans were watery.    It is one of the closest restaurants to us; so we wanted it to be good; but we will not be returning. [REVIEW_7] I went here for the first time on Friday with my wife and kids. From start to finish the service was quick and friendly. The food was the best Italian food I have had in a while. They started us out with delicious bread. We ordered the spicy chicken flat bread. The bread was very spicy but definitely good. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan and my wife ordered the monte rosena chicken dish with mashed potatoes instead of pasta. Most definitely the creamiest mashed potatoes I ever tasted. My egg plant parm was perfect. I will definitely go back to this restaurant again. [REVIEW_8] This place is great !! only sushi house in Carp! They have the best teriyaki chicken bowl. [REVIEW_9] Their pizza is pretty good; service is usually cool inside. But today I ordered a delivery for the first time; the driver was very insulting to me. When I open my door she asked me about a car across the street with a guy in the driver's seat. I replied ""I don't know;"" she said ""cus I don't wanna be set up to get robbed"". Mind you I already paid with my visa when I ordered; her behavior made me feel awkward as if I had done something wrong. I gave her the tip I had in my hand and said thank you; hoping that maybe if I remain polite she'll stop thinking so negative I just wanted some pizza not to be judged because of my surroundings or to be stereotyped. [REVIEW_10] This place is overrated. 4.5 stars on yelp should say something about this place. Went here for dinner with some friends and everything tastes average. The best thing  on the menu is the ca phe sua da; but really; you can get great coffee at any other place. Not to mention the atmosphere and environment. It's too small and tight thats its very uncomfortable to enjoy dinner. [REVIEW_11] These guys are great! I completely agree with all the previous reviews.  I asked for a moving quote on a Monday morning; and was able to set up an appointment for that Wednesday. I had boxes and furniture from 2 different apartments that needed to be moved into a new apartment. The crew was friendly; professional; and efficient; working tirelessly (up and down stairs) for 4 hours to get everything done. They were also extremely careful; and made sure everything was taped up and wrapped properly. All my belongings (including those plastic storage bins that tend to crack) arrived clean and without a scratch. The pricing is very fair; and there were no hidden fees. [REVIEW_12] Quick and super friendly. Emily was super helpful with our order. The burgers were cooked just right and our order of fries and onion rings were just the right amount of crisp. Overall; this was a great experience. [REVIEW_13] When this place first popped up on my phone as hot and new; I was so excited to try this place! It's always so exciting to try new cafes and ice cream places that pop in Reno since there really isn't many trendy places like these. It was interesting to see the cute wired sign and pink wall. The man at the register said him and his fiancé started this business so I wish them both luck! He was very welcoming very informative. The soft serve is so creamy-- the way it should be. The flavors are so yummy; it was nice to see familiar flavors like Ube and green tea. For some suggestions maybe a Thai tea or strawberry flavor? It was nice that we were offered pocky sticks to add to our krem creation. Maybe next time if adding wafer sticks or some type of cookies would be nice. I got the ube baby baby and it was delicious! I'll definitely be back for more! [REVIEW_14] The local staff don't appear to be keeping truck inventory statuses and availability accurate and relative ""real time"" - pick a business goal like ""updated in the system within x minutes (assess each on a couple key factors; perhaps group similar actions together; and define 2-3 tiers of service expectations in an SLA; based on the service uncertainty/complexity; its ""sensitivity"" analysis based on range of quality level and their relative impact to the customer.  Clearly; what the General Manager is working at or too; with respect to %accuracy and timeliness of updates to the online reservation system. Some examples are: - truck availability update window (15-30 minutes of a change in state; truck location)     (e.g. departed to destination; arrived at destination; cleaned & prepped; in service)  I made my online reservation Friday pickup either the Tuesday or Wednesday morning prior.  Based on the system availability and near ""real time"" electronic inventory data and known schedules for use/return to service; the system offered me the chance to request a  24 foot truck from location A (nearer to my house) at 9:00am on Friday.  A couple hours later; I got my ""confirmation"" telling me I could have a 24 foot truck from location B (twice as far from my house - about 30 minutes). And; the truck would be available at 12:00pm...but we could probably count on 9:00am (but I should call to confirm Friday morning.) If figured this was because the data changed after I made the request... not the case.  It wasn't right to begin with...and never did get updated in a timely manner; causing multiple trips; wasted time and conflicting data/opinions. Not an ""end to end"" customer focused supply chain...IMHO  I had a wasted trip way up north in Indy; and was told blatantly inaccurate information twice - wasting time; destroying trust and credibility from UHaul's perspective...  Eventually a lightbulb turned on.... The ""root cause"" here appears to be the failure of the local Uhaul to either have customer focused SLA's by which they are measured for their role/impact in the ""supply chain.""  OR; they had the SLA's in place...and were consistently not meeting them.  The local staff don't appear to be keeping truck inventory statuses and availability accurate and relative ""real time"" - pick a business goal like ""updated in the system within x minutes (assess each on a couple key factors; perhaps group similar actions together; and define 2-3 tiers of service expectations in an SLA; based on the service uncertainty/complexity; its ""sensitivity"" analysis based on range of quality level and their relative impact to the customer.

Some examples are: - truck availability update window (15-30 minutes of a change in state; truck location)     (e.g. departed to destination; arrived at destination; cleaned & prepped; in service)  If you truly take this to heart; I'd welcome hearing from you more to clarify any misunderstandings; and hear what specific actions you're taking / data you discover to support or challenge my assumptions and conclusions. [REVIEW_15] Great fish tacos and horchata! I'd recommend the combo 1. I've gone here many times throughout my time in Tucson; and this was definitely my favorite fish taco spot in Tucson (and possibly all of the USA I've visited so far). Shrimp tacos would be my second pick. [REVIEW_16] I travel often for work and having a box that feels like home is a big deal. Was able to make two drop-ins at the Downtown location and could not have been happier. Phil Guillot was a fantastic coach; the format and style were great; and the location and space were phenomenal. Now the expectations for my home box have been raised and I wish I lived closer! [REVIEW_17] The dark chocolate sorbetto is an absolute miracle. I don't know how something so creamy can possibly be dairy-free. It is; hands-down; the best dark chocolate sorbet I've ever had. Top it with their to-die-for peanut butter sauce and; well; deliciousness overload.   I've also had the gelato and it's always really good; the hubs particularly likes the chocolate hazelnut gelato. The cookies are also very good; especially the ricotta cookies. And the employees are all so friendly! I was initially sad when What's the Scoop left; but I really love this place. [REVIEW_18] Absolutely delicious foods!! Hard to find a vegan restaurant in the area and this was definitely an amazing find. People who worked there were so friendly and knew what they were talking about when it came to answering questions relating to the foods offered.   The presentations of the food too were beautiful and a good Sized portion as well. We went for brunch; am looking forward to going back sometime for lunch/dinner! [REVIEW_19] My computer got hacked and instead of taking it to Apple where they do a blanket sweep for $250 and it takes multiple days; Chris was able to walk me through what had happened.  He removed all of my files on an external drive and swiped the comp; put them back on and even re-installed Word for me free of charge.  He then changed all of the settings to make my computer as secure as possible and downloaded his preferred ad-blocker which also blocks ads on YouTube videos; which will be forever awesome.   It was cheaper; faster; and more hands on and thorough than Apple. Highly recommend his abilities. [REVIEW_20] This location is very easy to find off of Street Rd. I had called a couple of other tire shops that stated it would be a 3 to 4 hour wait; which I didn't have time for. I called them to see how long the waiting time was and they stated they could get me right in. I arrived within 10 minutes; and true to the word they pulled my car right in. I was working at a local car show and have to get back ASAP! Within minute they found the issue; valve stem and fixed at a very responsible price. This shop is a very friendly and helpful; and willing to go the extra mile to help on short notice. The shop was nice a clean and will ran. I would highly recommend them; I did not buy tires; but I did get a repair which they complete with ease. They could have tried to pull me into replacing the tire; in stead of repairing; which I've had shops in the past try to do. Thank you for your great service. [REVIEW_21] So happy I found a bomb local sushi place!! Always ignored this shop going to domino's but I'm so glad I popped in. Will be coming here more than I should from now on. I got this sushiya roll and I was more than pleased! The salmon tasted fresh and the miso was on point. 10/10 recommend this spot. [REVIEW_22] The burgers were good.  I loved the quiet atmosphere; we went on a Monday at 5.  My boyfriend had a shot of whiskey that he enjoyed.  Overall it was great. [REVIEW_23] My husband and I decided to try The Silverspoon this morning for breakfast.  I ordered the French toast with berry compote and a side of bacon.  The French toast was fluffy with a crispy crust - it rivaled the French toast I ate in South Jersey diners as a kid :)   And the bacon was caramelized to absolute perfection!  Hubby ordered the mushroom bisque to start off with; and was very pleased.  He then ordered the Silverberger.  He is quite picky about his burgers; but said midway through; ""this might be the best burger I've ever had!""  I just had to write a review after our visit today; because the food was truly exceptional! [REVIEW_24] Anyone who says that this restaurant is ""shockingly average"" does not know anything about fine dining.  I have eaten in famous restaurants all over the world; and this one is right up there with any of them.  I will admit that if you are looking for a ""scene"" or a ""trendy atmosphere""; this restaurant is not for you.  However; having said that; I will say that there is no other restaurant in Philadelphia that produces food that is as interesting; fresh; and delicious as Marc Vetri's.  The service is impeccable; the menu ever-changing; and the preparations fascinatingly nuanced.  I went there tonight for my tenth time.  I took a few friends out for a celebratory dinner.  We ate their famous charcuterie plate; a special preparation of nantucket bay scallops; pig's foot ravioli; pork belly papardelle; spinach gnocci; shoulder of baby goat; salt-cured branzino; a cheese plate; lavender gelato; and chocolate souffle.  We ordered ""family style"" and enjoyed every single bite.  In fact; we ordered ""seconds"" of the papardelle and scallops because they were so delicious.  Some advice before dining at this restaurant.  First; eat family style.  It is the best way to taste as much as possible of the diverse menu.  Second; let them help you choose the wine.  The employees of this restaurant are well-versed in the nuances of their wine selections and will help you find a reasonably priced bottle that pairs well with your menu choices and preferences.  Third; when you eat here; ""go all out"".  That means; get ready to eat a lot; and prepare to enjoy yourself thoroughly.  This is a restaurant tailored for those who enjoy a cozy; comfortable atmosphere; nice people; and good food.  Again; if you are looking for a trendy restaurant; go to Morimoto.  The food won't be NEARLY as good; but you'll find all of the wannabe hipsters you can handle.  I know this is a strong review; but I believe every word of it.  There are a lot of excellent restaurants in Philadelphia that may enjoy more ""street cred"" (think Le Bec Fin; Morimoto; Buddhakan; etc.); but certainly do not deserve it.  This restaurant is absolutely terrific; and if you walk in with an open mind (and granted; an open wallet); you will absolutely enjoy it as much as I do.  Enjoy.  This will be one of your better dining experiences; anywhere.  --WEM [REVIEW_25] If I had to choose one place for a romantic getaway in Santa Barbra I'd pick this place. I cannot say enough and they were extremely accommodating.  I took my girlfriend here for a weekend (Fri - Sun) for a combo birthday + Christmas gift and everything went perfect. They had the room set up with rose pedals when we walked in the first time; then I asked if they could set up champagne and chocolate covered strawberries when we went out for dinner.  When we got back for dinner the champagne; strawberries; and candles we all set up perfectly! My girlfriend was very surprised. Then they helped me schedule a couples massage that evening; which was another surprise. So the first afternoon / evening there was absolutely perfect.  The vibe of this inn is very boutique; quaint; and charming. Perfect for couples. We could also use the bikes daily (for free); which we did. They gave us great suggestions on where to go and what to do. Both State Street; the beach; and the train station are all walking distance.   I'd say my girlfriend had a great experience for her first stop in Santa Barbara because this place made such a nice impression. [REVIEW_26] McDonalds... What do you need to know?..   They serve the purpose. I'd complain about the inaudible Spanish fellow working the drive through but why would I expect much else..  Update:  they just charged me .25 cents for ranch..  I'm pretty wealthy actually but this stuff is so annoying.  I handed him a dollar; took 4 of them and walked to the trash can to throw away 3 of them as I only needed one.  I feel I made my point.. [REVIEW_27] If you order the same type of meals they will make a meal for one and split the amount of meat with the 2nd platter. Yes they always short you out of your meat. Why the heck did we only have one strip of grilled chicken for each wrap. This is not the first time this happened either. Don't even bother to tip them because you will still be hungry and will have to eat again to satisfy your stomach.       When we all order separate meals or separate types of meals; we get the correct amount of meat and fries. Idiots [REVIEW_28] We had a large party and were seated without delay.  The service and food were perfect.  It was mind blowing to find this quality; atmosphere and presentation inside a mall. [REVIEW_29] Salad was full of brown wilted iceberg lettuce. The pizza was cold by the time I arrived home (picked it up.) Way too expensive for this awful product. [REVIEW_30] Pleasant little laundromat right next to the Peppermill. 25 cent pinball and video games to while away the time. Many post-BurningMan cleanings while I was there.",23
17,"[REVIEW_1] If you want a hole in the wall pizza place this is where you should go. I don't know why more people don't know about this place. The pizza is amazing! Maybe even best pizza in STL. I love it. I wouldn't classify it as Chicago style though because it doesn't have chunky tomato sauce. [REVIEW_2] Super friendly staff! The cashier is amazing; he even remembers frequent customers and thanks the military customers for their service!  The pizza is always made to order. Hot; fresh and delicious. Highly recommend! [REVIEW_3] We recently moved within walking distance of the store.  On my first visit; I found the employees to be no so friendly.  They didn't make eye contact; say hello; can I help you; nothing!  I brushed it off as just a bad day.  Today I went back and that will be my last time.... The deli lady and the cashier were the only employees that spoke to me or make eye contact for that matter.  The people that look like managers don't smile or speak.  The bag boy was hanging on the coke cooler door when I went to the register.  He piled can goods on foil pans that I bought and when I asked him to move them he said ""well I didn't bend them""!  No one offered to take my groceries to my car either.  I'll drive the extra miles to shop at the Publix on Alderman and Alt. 19 in Palm Harbor.  Those people ALWAYS go out of their way to be friendly. [REVIEW_4] This is the can't miss taco stop in Santa Barbara. Homemade corn tortillas served on the best steak; pork and chicken tacos you'll ever have the pleasure of devouring. Perfectly portioned; seasoned and priced. I've eaten a lot of tacos in my time here on Earth and these rank among the very best. Oh; and that salsa bar is still giving me daydreams. [REVIEW_5] I came often for the $1 Beers/Wells on Thursday nights. Finally decided to stop in for lunch.  Great food here. Blackened Salmon sandwich with a side of fries for $12.50 caught my attention on the menu.  Will definitely come back for seconds. [REVIEW_6] LOVE chiptole- all locations! this location had great customer service and the food is siesta on point! [REVIEW_7] Stood in line and were ignored. The host proceeded to seat his friends who were clearly standing behind us before asking if we had been helped. [REVIEW_8] Excellent deep dish pizza. Prolly the best local pizza in St. Louis. Come early on thur-sat night as it takes a long time to cook. [REVIEW_9] Never coming back. This is the second we've given then. Tonight; they charged us an extra $5; but was easily correct; not a huge deal. Second; the onion rings tasted like vanilla! We ordered a brownie cookie dough blast and got a cookie dough shake instead; the difference of about a dollar. My shake was missing the middle portion(see photo). The only good thing about this trip was the mozzarella sticks. 2 shakes and 2 sides for $15; no thanks. [REVIEW_10] Disappointing experience beginning with confusion with order and computer software. Had to place my order 3x; chicken wrap was okay but not spectacular; served with fries that were frozen  in the middle and soggy. Not what I expected for 10.00. [REVIEW_11] This place was disgusting! We used to eat here quite a bit but it sure has gone downhill fast! The place was dirty (garbage cans overflowing; garbage left on tables because the garbage cans couldn't be used). Nothing was filled up (sauce cups; napkins; silverware). The chicken was very dry and couldn't even be cut with the plaatic knife! Well it was good while it lasted but they have seen the last of me! [REVIEW_12] I love Vedge and was really looking forward to Wiz Kid for vegan take-out in my neighborhood. Huge disappointment!  Very few healthy options! (Note: see all the reviews about the fries;). It may be tasty but I can't say because; as a healthy vegetarian; there was nothing appealing for me to order. I stopped in on several different occasions in the hope of finding some additional menu options; but no luck at all. Really too bad! [REVIEW_13] Service is terrible; food is ok; location is great (which is why the average yelp review is currently hanging to a mediocre 3 stars).   I've been here many times. It's always about the same. Very convenient; as it's located in Jackson Square. The open window seating is great.   The food is ok; not great; but edible.  The service is where the place needs serious help. One example: I sat at a table (this is a seat yourself type of place); and the table wasn't yet cleaned. The bus boy (old man) was rude about the situation and yelled ""you need to get up and move so I can clean the water on the floor!""  Umm; ok? Maybe you should have a better system for cleaning tables? Or realize that the whole city is a little dirty and a little water on the floor would have gone unnoticed?   Overall; management is the problem. No standard protocol; and not much training for their workers. [REVIEW_14] Very cool store with fossils; crystals; geodes; stones; both finished and in raw form. A selection of jewelry; pendants and other interesting stones.  Broad selection of necklaces; sterling silver chains and rings.  This store rocks! [REVIEW_15] This place has good food. However; the customer service is terrible. I arrived at around 7:30 pm on a Thursday and I wanted to order a take out appetizer or meal. First; I asked them what was the meal of the day. A waitress told me that they don't have any left. Ok that was understandable. Then I asked the same waitress if I can order meat pies (arayes). She said that this will take 40 minutes to make it ready. She pointed to a group of people sitting of about 25 persons and implied that they were busy making food for them. Afterwards; I asked her what about just a regular appetizer like hummus and baba gannoush. She again said that they need 40 minutes to prepare it! Also she pointed at the same group of people with her finger.  At that point I just left the restaurant.  It is horrendous that they needed 40 minutes to prepare hummus!! It is very obvious that they were overwhelmed and didn't want to waste their time on a small order. Very unprofessional and very unwelcoming! Very bad service! [REVIEW_16] It always has a strong smell when you open the door plus they aren't friendly or approachable at all.. .I will never go in there again [REVIEW_17] We had my friends bridal shower here and it was so beautiful! The staff was so friendly and helpful! Everyone at the Wine Tap was AMAZING!! Of course; food was delicious too! [REVIEW_18] I would recommend Twisted Twig to everyone - excellent service; very friendly; and create amazing arrangements!  You will not regret working with Jen! I reached out to a few different florist 2 weeks before my wedding. I was frantic my wedding was only 2 weeks away and didn't have a florist; even though it was a small wedding. I got a hold of Jen; who I might say was very responsive.  I got on the phone with Jen and she was so nice and very genuine. We spoke about what I was looking for and I texted her some pictures of inspiration and my dress. She asked me if there were certain flowers I was looking for and my budget. I didn't have any flowers in mind; as long as the colors are what I wanted and told her my budget. She sent me a quote; staying within my budget; noting the flowers she would use for the bouquet; boutonniere; and floral arrangements for the arch I had. It was nice that Jen works with you to stay in your budget yet still get what you want.  On the wedding day; Jen arrived at my hotel door right on time with my beautiful bouquet. The floral arrangements at the site was gorgeous also. Jen really hit the mark on what I wanted for my wedding. She also was very sweet and added some roses on the chairs by the aisle to my surprise; which was not on the quote. That was very special because it pulled the whole ceremony look together and I felt Jen really wanted everything to look perfect for me. [REVIEW_19] Staff are wonderful. Bartender was extremely pleasant. Other than that a horrible nightmare. Interesting decor; though trying to hard.Dirty carpeting and dark rooms.  Super loud air conditioning unit; bring ear plugs; or don't sleep. Fancy shower unit but leaky doors and mildew. Light bulb went out in the middle of the night; forced to shower in the dark; no body is regularly changing the bulbs to prevent this. Would avoid staying over night. [REVIEW_20] Did not like this hotel at all. Me and my husband stayed there one night after getting off our honeymoon cruise out of New Orleans. While still on the boat I called the hotel to let them know that we would only be staying one of the two nights we reserved due to some issues with our home in Houston. We had to leave early to address them in person. I communicated that with the manager who stated that he would call me back because he was dealing with another customer. Never received a callback. We checked in Saturday March 5 at 1600. We left the next day Sunday March 6 at 1130. As we checked out I told the manager it was an early checkout and he said that I would have to talk to the third party vendor (booking.com) to not be charged. I was okay with that.  Fast forward to today. Called booking.com and the customer associate stated that the manager charged me for the second night that I never used as a penalty for not warning them of our ealy check out. He lied. I spoke to him at least twice about us leaving. DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU ARE OUT OF TOWN. VERY UNCLEAN AND DISGUSTING and the management is sketchy. Take your money and go somewhere nicer. [REVIEW_21] Very disappointed. We went to eat  at 2:15 on Saturday and were told the kitchen closed at 2. Their website says: Sat & Sun all day. Their website claims that they are open until 5. I'm always a bit suspect of places that can't manage simple details like their hours on their website. It makes me wonder about the awareness to quality and other ""small"" items. [REVIEW_22] Love this Place! The instructors actually care about their clients. Great Customer Service! [REVIEW_23] I love this place; too bad I only go about 4 times a year.  Its more of treat for me.  Quality food & service and would expect nothing less based on the price. [REVIEW_24] Buyer Beware!  I visited this store when they were called Vintage 429 in 2003. I bought a signed  Nirvana poster with a COA stating money back if not authentic. We this past week I found out the poster is fake. The COA was signed by the co-owner of Vintage 329. When I called the store this past weekend; they wanted nothing to do with my complaint and were completely unsympathetic. 1200 dollars down the drain. Just because they changed their name; their name is still on my COA. I sent them an email message via their website and have been ignored up to this point. [REVIEW_25] I went to the drive thru hopefully I can get served so was at the speaker for half hour and lady had a attitude cause we asked if we could get service to say they had to change till and several cars left in the process I had to go home hungry that was totally sad luckily I not a diabetic [REVIEW_26] horrible food! waited for my nachos that took forever!!!! when they came they were freezing cold even the chips highly disappointed wish i could've given them  no stars they do not deserve any of my stars [REVIEW_27] Coffee and tea done properly. First time here and i was not disapointed. Will be going back. [REVIEW_28] I believe the owner greeted me at the door. She was rude and threatened service if I didn't get gel. The quality received is not worth the price. [REVIEW_29] Love it love it love it!!! I finally got to try the barrel for the first time! We got the sample for $12 and I also got Pinot noir an for was pretty good as usual! They have life music (first Friday) and the atmosphere is very nice and relaxing! So glad this place is in phoenixville! [REVIEW_30] I was suspicious of the quality of yet another chain restaurant; but I was pleasantly surprised by how yummy it was! While paying for my food I saw the fresh meat being prepped (not hidden behind the scenes like most places). I went on a Sunday which is great for families; because for every plate you order you get a free kid's plate! Not to mention there is free soft serve ice cream for everyone! I will definitely be returning.",14
18,"[REVIEW_1] You really can't go wrong with this place.   Food is great; prices are reasonable; and you get a TON of food for the price.  Staff is all extremly friendly.  I love comming here; breakfast or lunch; but a personally prefer it at breakfast time; especially on the weekends. The food is all cooked really well; and tastes excelent.  I've been here many times of the years; and ive never once been let down. I hope they stay around a long time. [REVIEW_2] Pretty much the best Italian restaurant in the entire Philly area.  Went there for lunch today.   Excellent bread. I asked for garlic my wife no garlic. They brought out two full bowls  Bruschetta was real good.   Toasted longhots stuffed with prosciutto were killer!  I had a HUGE portion of angel hair with hot sausage. I could only finish half it was so big.   My wife kept stealing mine while she ate gnocchi in vodka sauce that she said was great.   It's a small place on the outside but has a big dining room  You can't go wrong at this place! [REVIEW_3] Of all the restaurants we tried in New Orleans; this was by far our favorite. I had both lunch and dinner on two separate occasions. The service was wonderful; the ambiance is cozy but alive. Make sure to call ahead and get a reservation over the phone if opentable looks booked. Their lunch special spicy fried chicken is a must have! If you are a party of two or three; ask for the corner booth by the window. Best table in the house. [REVIEW_4] Just got in from my 1st visit to Oriental Pearl and I loved it ! I wanted to try the Pho but my mouth was watering after looking at the menu. They have so much to choose from ! To start off; we ordered Vietnamese spring rolls which were delicious ! Light and flaky; with a wonderful side sauce. I ordered Beef with crunchy noodles as my entree. So good ! The beef was tender; green pepper and onion were cooked so that they weren't too soggy. Just right. And the noodles were crisp with added flavor from the curry sauce. Wonderful !! My sister ordered the Triple Delight ; with shrimp; scallops and chicken. And she loved it ! ( She doesn't like spicy food; either. But said this was perfect.  Not spicy hot. We couldn't finish our platters. But found room for ice cream with fried bananas.  Perfect end to a great meal. The service was great; too. Food arrived quickly and the waiter and the mgr stopped by to ask us how everything was. They offer additional sauces on the table. One I fell in love with was Plum sauce. It's kind of like a sweet soy sauce. OMG.. So good. And the Owner was nice enough to give me a container to take some home; too ! Add this to your list of places to go. It's casual and quiet.  Nice place to eat and relax. Will definitely be back ! [REVIEW_5] Exceptional entrees; exceptional service.....and many very healthful options. One of our favorite local venues. Recommended without reservation. [REVIEW_6] Even though this isn't a 5-star hotel; it definitely deserves a five star review! Here is why my wife and thought so...  1. Close to train station and just a short walk to the beach and State St. 2. It's quiet. Even though it only took us ten minutes to walk here from the Amtrak station; you could only hear the trains at night way off in the distance. Castillo St. is a slightly busy street; but our room (#17) was set back from the street; so we didn't notice traffic noise at night.  3. Clean; clean; clean. There was no ""ew"" feeling when you walked in the door. I'm a bit of a germaphobe and this place passed my picky expectations.  4. Modern and new feeling. The fixtures; granite counters and granite shower (with good water pressure); bed; and flat screen TV were all new...or at least they seemed like it.  5. The staff were friendly. They seemed like the kind of folks you'd meet in a quaint; small-town sort of a place. Check in and check out were super fast. They let us keep our excess baggage there on the last day while we wandered Santa Barbara a little more before our train left.   Thanks; Castillo Inn. We'll be back! [REVIEW_7] My family has been customers of George's for years. You pay for what you get. The quality of the food is premier and they don't hold back on portion size. Their cheesesteaks are amazing (chopped steak) and their chicken cheesesteaks are made from the same chicken as their Char platters; which is legit. Their Char platters come with some of the best and juciest grilled chicken I've ever had. They make their own sauce; so just that alone puts their wings above the other restaurants in the neighborhood that just use Franks Red Hot. I have yet to have something on their menu that I didn't like. [REVIEW_8] Well worth the wait... and weight  The Banana and Nutella with caramel is my favorite. [REVIEW_9] Two things I can not believe; 1) That I am doing an updated review on a gas station and 2) that I am raising them to a 5 Star rating.  However; I am doing it because they deserve it.   As Christine stated in her review; the customer service here is outstanding. Everyone of the employees I have meet are friendly; out going and helpful. It is like they all take Pollyanna pills before their shift.  It is so good to see people enjoying their work and spreading a little happiness. You do know that stuff is contagious. If not stop by this U Gas and you will see customers come in with a frown and walk out with a smile and they didn't even have to pay for it. Smiles are free.   The store is always super clean. The booze is super cheap. I can  get my Scotch; vodka and beer here at a savings when I do not have time to make the pilgrimage out to Costco. Their selection and variety of convince store staples have also saved my ass numerous times already.  They also sell me winning Scratch Lottery Tickets. I am hoping for a big win on Mega and Power some day.   Their prepared foods are done by Gigi and the selection and variety is better then their competitor QT. I've tried the salads; a couple of the sandwiches and I like the way the also package fresh fruits and cubed cheeses for snacking.  My only draw back on the prepared foods is that they do not have the little box that gives you the Nutrition Facts. Being a dieter; I like to have that information at my fingertips.   Be alert in the parking lot; as this place has gotten popular the parking lot has gotten a little crazy.  Everyone rushing in for affordable gas; winning lottery tickets; cheap booze and great customer service makes for a parking lot derby. [REVIEW_10] Coffee wasn't up to par. Food was slow to come out. And it's a Wednesday it's not that crowded. Service so so. Young waitresses you can tell there not experienced. Food is always good. Food was cold this time had a breakfast skillet. Gone to stop coming here. [REVIEW_11] Park is beautiful.  Plenty to do at this park including tennis; racquetball; handball and more.  You can even rent equipment at Lanai Coffee right next to tennis courts.  There are bathrooms located behind tennis courts as well as next to the playground.    If hungry or thirsty while at park you have multiple choices of delicious snacks and drinks at Lanai Coffee as well. [REVIEW_12] Have I told you lately how amazing Coventry is?  I just can't get over the staff. It's like coming in to a family's home. Everyone is so over the top friendly; and their breakfasts are amazing. Their Cheesesteak omlette is a heart attack waiting to happen but it is the best Friday morning treat of your life.   I just can't say enough good things..chili; baked potatoes; matzoh ball soup; and their eggs are among my top favorites; but I can't see going wrong with anything here. [REVIEW_13] I love this place. The service was awesome and the food; even better. I always hated beets until I had it here. OMG!!! I will only eat beets here. Love!!! [REVIEW_14] This is a place you pull up to and question whether you should go in. It's connected to kind of a shady looking motel but don't let that detour you. They have great Mexican food and they guy who runs the place is so nice! They always remember what we like to drink; and since my husband orders the same thing every time they basically just confirm what he wants. Consistently good food with plenty of cheap lunch specials; and inexpensive meals on the dinner menu. Try it! It won't disappoint! [REVIEW_15] Food quality is great; even for lunch time specials (as you know most establishments use specials to use up supplies). The salmon was cooked perfectly. The angus ny steak and filet migon are meat; so cook to your preference. I chose medium well and I got that exactly. Serving size is a bit small; but maybe its because lunch special (so benefit of the doubt). Great place to eat.   This place is byob. [REVIEW_16] Super friendly staff. General tso pizza is very interesting! Very authentic Taiwanese food! I will stop by very time when I visit Tampa! [REVIEW_17] Very nice; quiet and dark restaurant. Chinese and sushi offered. Had szechuan chicken; hot and sour soup; and steamed rice. Hubbie had the prime rib and shrimp hot pot. Just the right amount of food. Didn't have to take any home. Service was excellent. [REVIEW_18] In town on business. Great food. Fried oysters; lamp chops and dessert were all A+; coming from a New Yorker. Reasonable prices. Great service. [REVIEW_19] Finally a local barbecue master with a genuine passion for getting it right. The brisket is to die for... Melt in your mouth slice of heaven made right in Roslyn!!!  Mike knows how to make barbecue pork;ribs;chicken;brisket and cornbread like he grew up in the Deep South where this kind of cooking is religion. Guy Fieri would be calling this joint; ""winner; winner chicken dinner""   Take out or eat in bring your appetite to try the brisket sloo-ow cooked for 19 hours at 190 degrees the best in the area.  Get in early because he sells out. You don't want to settle for a McRib sandwich!!! [REVIEW_20] Best Lassi I've had in Philly. The owner is super nice. The chaat is perfect. I've lived here for years and this is one of Cedar Park's best. [REVIEW_21] Burrito Ranchero kicks butt and takes names.  It's not for fussy people.  Simple but tasty food.  Authentic is in the eye of the beholder folks. Nuff said......... [REVIEW_22] This is my new favorite restaurant in NOLA.  I've been several times and can't stop raving  about it.  I have a huge crush on their curried goat.  The goat is tender and well seasoned.  If you're lucky and they are serving them get the fried squash blossoms stuff with cheese.  Perfect crunch...melts in your mouth.  You won't want to share this dish trust me.  Rarely do I ever order desert but the meal is always so I good I just can't pass it up.  It's not a huge place which I prefer.  The decor is well thought out; relaxed sophisticated.  I am thrilled Chef Nina Compton chose New Orleans to open her restaurant... or did New Orleans choose her?! [REVIEW_23] Had lunch here for my birthday on October 7th and was not disappointed.  It was definitely one of the go to restaurants on this small pier and we really didn't have to wait that long to be seated. There was seating both outside and inside; but we decided to sit indoors since it was a bit windy and hot outside since we were literally in the ocean on the pier.  My boyfriend got us the shrimp cocktail salad and the 4lb (maybe it was 6lbs lolz) crab to share that was the special of the day. But out waiter had informed us that they ran out of the specific crab we wanted; but gave us two different crabs that was equivalent to the weight of the crab that we missed out on.  Once our food arrived; we dug right in. Everything tasted; so delicious and fresh. We finished off everything that we ordered and made sure not to leave any sort of crab meat morsel behind. The shrimp salad was surprisingly good. It was light and the shrimps were juicy. The crabs had their own different flavors and came with really crispy onion rings on the side and melted butter.   I definitely will come back here again cause pricey as it was we definitely got our monies worth! [REVIEW_24] I assume that Alsatian translates into ""Meatlovers Paradise""!  First; the amazing happy hour of 50cent oysters; then the $10 Pate plate. I never thought of myself as a ""Liver"" man but John Besh has turned me into one.  The service was adequate if a little over-bearing but the food and drinks made up for it... [REVIEW_25] Finally made the trip to the unsuspecting spot where Perennial resides. What a gem!  Based in the bottom of a refurbished Coke factory that now houses loft apartments; this place is awesome. As soon as we walked in; the bartenders gave us a friendly greeting and asked if it was our first time - indeed it was!  She then went through the menu and all the beer options available that day.  My husband and I both opted for a flight of beer to find out which one we liked best. My winner was Midnight Rambler; a dark full-bodied Belgian Stout. Mmmmm; mmmmm; good.  To pair with our beers we ordered the charcuterie plate and the pumpkin humus. Both were spectacular but the pumpkin humus blew my mind! I am a fan of all things pumpkin and it makes so much sense to use it in humus. It also came sprinkled with pomegranate seeds on top which gave each bite a tart; acidity to it. I am drooling right now just thinking about it.   Our experience at Perennial could not have been any better. The beer; the food; the service all five star worthy. Oh and we got to chatting with a group of home brewers who traveled up from Memphis to try the place; very cool.   Got some great tips to use for our future home brews.  This place is a winner and we can't wait to go back to try and get our hands on some of their famous Abraxas beer next month!! [REVIEW_26] Good coffee; super cute location; and some of the best service anywhere. I haven't eaten there yet; but I'm sure I will be back to try the food in the next few days. The barista Kayla (I don't know if the spelling is correct) was super friendly; and she took a bunch of time to recommend other places in the area. [REVIEW_27] Whoa; I feel I must come to their defense. My daughter is 23 and they were her first and only dentists. I feel their dentistry is fine. I do remember that 18 years ago the receptionist told me I should change my name to match my daughter's name. (so they would know where to apply the check I sent in for payment - which they cashed anyway). Other than that; the care and service has always been good. [REVIEW_28] I always say that Indy has something for everybody; but saying that it has a place inside of 465 for mountain bikers to go enjoy their hobby is even something that surprises me. Fortunately; it's a true statement; and its access is completely free. This little park located south of 96th St. between Keystone and Allisonville is in an area normally associated with businesses and restaurants; but this wooded trail that runs along creeks and ponds is a nice way to escape that. Granted; you're still reminded of where you are when you hear the traffic on the interstate; but it sure beats biking anywhere else in the area.   The entrance to the park can be easy to miss; but it's a little gravel turn off of 96th St. just east of Hazel Dell. There is a small sign; but it's easy to miss on the busy street. Once you turn in; there is a nice large paved lot; a shelter house; lots of picnic tables; and a big information board about the trail. I've never been the only one at the park; and there are usually quite a few other people there either on the trail already or getting prepped. The information that is posted on their board is pretty helpful; so it would be a good idea to check that out.   The trail itself is maintained fantastically. It's only open during the day; and closes when it is too wet to ride without harming the trail; but it's one of the better mountain biking trails I've been on; although that's a short list. It's labeled as a beginner trail; and I think that's appropriate. It will give a beginner plenty of challenges without ever putting them too far out of their comfort zone. It's also fun for more advanced riders as it is a very fast and flowing trail that you can really fly though. The HMBA; who maintains the trail; has done a good job of putting splits in the trail that can take you to jumps; bridges; and drops if you want to hit those obstacles. The majority of the trail is through woods; with a little bit of it opening into a grassland type area. It's mostly a dirt trail; but there are some sections that get kind of rocky or have a lot of tree roots that make it fun. There aren't really any substantial hills; but there are plenty of short sharp inclines that mix things up. It's also a great place to see plenty of wildlife. I've seen quite a few deer out there and you can always hear squirrels and birds all around. A significant portion of the trail runs next to water; either in the form of a large creek or a pond; and as long as you don't end up in either of them; it makes for a nice scenic ride.  I think they say the trail is about 9 miles long. It's a single track trail that runs clockwise and everything is very clearly marked and distinguishable. At about the halfway point (when you are going under the interstate) you can turn around and catch the return part of the loop to cut the trip in half. While there are quite a few people that use it; I would never say it gets crowded. There are some good riders that make it out here; so if you are slower than someone coming up behind you there are plenty of places to pull aside and just wait to let them pass you so you never feel pressured to push yourself faster than the pace that you want.   A quick note for those who decide they want to hike or trail run here; it is one of the few trails in which bikers actually have the right of way; so be careful and respectful.  A huge thanks to all the HMBA members and volunteers who keep this trail in perfect condition. [REVIEW_29] Only the best Mexican food in Florida!!!!  Since the first day I tried it I love it I keep coming back!!! [REVIEW_30] I have been to this restaurant at least five times and have never been disappointed. They have the best grilled cheese in the city - complete with beets and mustard (sounds strange but don't judge until you've tried it)! Their creamy grits are tremendous as well. Overall; in a city that doesn't do breakfast so well; this place will satisfy every craving!",30
19,"[REVIEW_1] First time here - absolutely LOVE it....so happy!!!  The food extraordinary (especially smoked soft shell crab appetizer)... we all had the flounder - and all loved it. The converted church also amazing...love the settings. [REVIEW_2] The restaurant itself is beautifully crafted and decorated. The elegant ambience sets the mood and as a tough critic...I love it! The food is not rushed and it's delectable taste gave me a memory I will never forget. Service is fast and server was extremely polite .Amazing & awesome food experience !! [REVIEW_3] Don't be deterred by the exterior - this place is definitely a diamond in the rough.  All around super impressed by the quality of the food and service. Got the chirashi bowl which was amazing and extremely fresh with a wide variety of fish. Was especially fond of the salmon as this was some of the best I've had in a while. Nice to see great sushi outside of the city.   Pro Tip: make a reservation ahead of time to avoid waiting as this place only has a handful of tables. [REVIEW_4] I LOVE this place!! I always passed by it; but I really did not know anything about Afghan cuisine. Went in one day and I'm glad I did. Food was great. The service was great too.   We've been back many times and will continue to do so. [REVIEW_5] Mazzaros market is fat kid heaven.  When you walk inside through the arch you begin to smell the baked goods and coffees being made.  I immediately dart towards the cookies and pitzelles. Grab a cannoli then make my way over to the Fresh pastas being made. If i could afford to live inside here i would but then i would eat everything and they would have to roll me out the door. Hands down this is the best Italian market to get all your needs for a nice Sunday dinner. [REVIEW_6] Fantastic; I repeat fantastic place to go for breakfast or brunch. We were steered here by 2 different locals; a bar tender and a fellow working in a hot sauce shop. The grits; andouille sausage; bacon were all perfect. The grits in particular.....we came back a few days later and had their breakfast burrata. It was spectacular. Deconstructed to its individual parts then allowing you to put each bite together however you like. So unbelievably good.......we will definitely be back next time in town!! [REVIEW_7] Great food and a small-town feel! Angie is one of the sweetest people and makes you feel so very welcomed! [REVIEW_8] My go-to spot for low key take out/sit in sushi.  Excellent food; quick turn around and contemporary inside.  Highly recommend.  Only suggestion would be to add much more soy sauce packets in the to-go bag :) [REVIEW_9] Rude; inattentive; uneducated and they always make you feel that you are bothering them. I have started using mobile order because it's one less idiot to deal within the chain. When they start making $15 an hour we will be ordering from kiosks and maybe dealing with one person. [REVIEW_10] This is my first review and I really felt it was needed.  I love to cook but also love eating out . It's very exciting to see all the new restaurants opening up around town and I really want them all to succeed. I've been to Nox  many times now. I have to say it's been so inconsistent last night being the Worst!!!  Waitstaff were inexperienced; appetizers came out with the dinners and only one was hot.  Had to send two out of the three dinners back for various reasons.  As you know Restaurants seem to come and go around here so please guys pay attention and remember you're only as good as your staff.  Sincerely [REVIEW_11] Every time lm in Philly; this is a must have. Just right around the corner from my condo. Great service. Great food. So glad your right around the corner from me. [REVIEW_12] The man who worked on me did a wonderful job. I loved the flower the lady painted on my big toe. For those reasons I will be back. [REVIEW_13] The shrimp poboy was out of this world. And the white chocolate bread pudding was delicious. There's no drive-in option: take out only. [REVIEW_14] Delicious; healthy; home-cooked style food. Highly recommended! [REVIEW_15] I love this place. The owner is awesome and very hands on. Everyone that works here is friendly and will talk to you. I eat here a couple times a week.   I like that they know me by name. [REVIEW_16] My brother lives in Santa Barbara and every time I visit him; I HAVE to go to the Paradise Cafe!! The food is amazing; the ambiance is classic Santa Barbara-style; and there always seems to be a lot of locals; which is a good sign. There are so many restaurant choices in SB; but I always go back to this place. You really can't go wrong with anything you order; but make sure you save room for the Paradise Pie! Best dessert on the planet!!! [REVIEW_17] Very good pizza The owner is wonderful The place is renovated ; everyone seems to be friendly really want you to enjoy your food French fries are good salad and also the chicken fingers i'm a vegetarian so I don't know too much of the other meals but I do know everything else is good and my kids love the chicken fingers [REVIEW_18] I have had Pizza hut before at a different location and I don't remember the service ever being this horrible. We ordered delivery. They were late; we called them multiple times and the manager would not come to the phone except on the last try. When he finally spoke to us; he blamed us and said we didn't pick up the phone and that he left a voicemail. I immediately knew he was lying since   1. if he called us the multiple times he said we would have received the call 2. if he left a voicemail message THERE WOULD BE A VOICEMAIL MESSAGE  DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS LOCATION. THE MANAGER TRIES TO PLACE BLAME ON CUSTOMERS; LIES AND DOES NOT KNOW WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS!! [REVIEW_19] I had heard good things about Fresh Produce but I have to say I was not impressed. I noticed that my sunflowers and blueberries were moldy upon arriving home.  The tomatoes there were all bruised and mushy.  The only thing I think that I might be happy with are my apples.  Not to mention; the woman that rang me up threw around my produce and bruised it all up.  I won't be back. [REVIEW_20] A must go-to place if you're in University City. This place's chaat and lassi are to die for. It tastes fresh and refreshing; and will fill you up. My recommendation for chaat: go for the mild; even if you like really spicy food. It's not because it's super spicy (it still has a kick though) but because the balance of flavors is better with the mild chaat. The spicy chaat; the spiciness overpowers the rest of the goodies and it gets a bit too saucy for me. As for lassis; I've had the mango; rose; and mint - all I would recommend. [REVIEW_21] Very nice; quiet and dark restaurant. Chinese and sushi offered. Had szechuan chicken; hot and sour soup; and steamed rice. Hubbie had the prime rib and shrimp hot pot. Just the right amount of food. Didn't have to take any home. Service was excellent. [REVIEW_22] Oh my gosh; coolest optical place ever! Completely different frames than what are normally available at your optometrist's office. If you're a fan of the retro; cat-eye 1960s look; SEE is absolutely necessary! The frames aren't cheap; but well worth the price. Huge selection; attractive displays and helpful staff. I wish I could give SEE 10 stars! [REVIEW_23] So glad I finally listened to my boyfriend.... this place hands down has the most delicious and amazing shrimp po boy I've had in the entire state of Florida.  Definitely recommend!!!! You will not be disappointed [REVIEW_24] I've been in the Carollwood/Tampa area since 1988 and it surprises the heck out of me that there are still great places tucked away that I've not only not been to but also not really heard of.  I saw Gio's listed on a list of italian restaurants in the area and decided to try it out.   Gio's is towards the back of the set of strip stores anchored by Marshalls just north of Waters.  In fact; coming from the north; I was directed by the GPS to take the left off of Dale Mabry onto Humphrey; then a right on N. Himes and a right on Waters and pull into the area by Gold's Gym.  This actually turned out to be the best way there considering the work traffic heading north around 6 pm on both Dale Mabry and Waters..   We got there around 6 pm on a Wednesday night and the place was somewhat empty.  There were about 8 other customers seated at one table and that was it.  By the time we left; around 7:00 pm; another 20 customers had piled in and were seated.   My wife and I started off with two glasses of California (Foxbrook?) Cabernet wine and a Caprese salad.  The salad was 3 slices of tomatoes and mozzarella in a vinaigrette dressing and chopped basil on a bed of mixed greens.  The dressing was a perfect mix of balsamic vinaigrette oil.  I hate it when the vinaigrette is over powering and too sharp.  This wasn't My wife had a entree of eggplant parmesan with a side of linguine pasta.  Half eaten and half came home.  Was it good?  ""yes; indeed"".  She is a Tiramisu groupie at heart and finished with that as dessert.  Timamisu?  ""excellent; creamy; flavorful"". My entree was the Veal Bellavista which was a veal scallopini sautéed with mushrooms; artichokes; capers in a lemon butter sauce with a side of sautéed mixed vegetables.  Excellent.  The cabernet was a subtle cabernet; not an overpowering one that tastes great with a large grilled steak so it complemented the entire meal.   I finished with a double expresso.    Service:  attentive but not overbearing.  helpful and willing to hold a conversation with you if you so enjoy.  Otherwise; respectful.    Atmosphere: great; simple decorations and pictures; background Italian music at this time of day.    Price:  somewhat pricey but worth it for a special day or that once a month visit.    Going back:  Definitely.  While we were there a friend of mine facebooked and said he would be in the Tampa area next month and wanted to hook up.  Why not here? [REVIEW_25] Had the brisket sandwich with two sides and a drink for 9.99 - Great barbecue at an affordable price. Wonderful side such as potato casserole cream spinach baked beans green beans [REVIEW_26] I've been reading the bad reviews on this page; and they make me wonder if the reviewers have been to the same location I was at. I found the place spotlessly clean; and everyone was friendly to a fault. I'd like to give a special shout-out to Maisha (probably spelling that wrong); who was on duty at about 6:30 PM on Friday; October 16; 2015. She treated me and every other customer like we were her best friends - making sure everyone had everything they needed. Great experience! [REVIEW_27] Similar experience at this place ..gelato is great...service sucks.a friend from out of town came to visit and we decided it would be cool to go here since they never had gelato..boy what a mistake..day staff cool..night staff not so much..they acted like we were an annoyance then a customer then whispering and laughing ..made my friend feels uncomfortable..so the young manager pops out from the back and I'm thinking cool though s guy will make them act more respectable;again wrong..he actually joined in.this place had great service not even a year ago..don't know what happened [REVIEW_28] Was in town for a week and came by this little hole in the wall.  The pa nang chicken was excellent.  I ordered one star spicy and it came quick.  Will definitely return. [REVIEW_29] Pizza fusion was way better than I had expected. We decided to get the Greek pizza which was absolutely delicious. The staff was very nice and we were served quickly. The environment was relaxing and I thought their choices were great! They have many vegetarian and gluten free options! [REVIEW_30] What's the point of setting a pick up time for a ToGo order when you end up waiting 30mins after that to get your food anyway?? The restaurant wasn't busy in the slightest; and it literally took over 30 minutes from the time I was supposed to pick up my order for them to actually bring out my to go order. I could've walked in and ordered food; and I would've gotten it faster.",24
20,"[REVIEW_1] What a great place. A must go to when in NOLA. Not a Bourbon street bar or night club. Its a wine store with meats & cheeses and a jazz bar. Also has a great menu too Excellent food; great plates and music [REVIEW_2] Needed to get the windows tinted on my new Ram 2500 Megacab. I have never been here before but based on all the Yelp reviews I figured it was worth a shot. Garrett got me right in and tinted all my windows including the windshield while I waited. First time ever having a windshield tinted and now there is no going back!! Garrett is a total pro and did a great job. The tint turned out great. Getting the headlights wrapped next; as they also do protective wraps. Having been to other tint shops in town; I can honestly say Garrett's shop is without a doubt the cleanest most professional shop around and offers high quality films. [REVIEW_3] Because when I say I want a non smoking room;it doesn't mean put me a a smoking floor in an enclosed hotel in a non smoking room. I don't want to smell that shit EVERYTIME I walk out my door. Won't be back. Thats why I called at 3:00 to make a resi so I could get a good room. But he wouldn't make me a reservation. [REVIEW_4] Had a group of 8 eat at ECP. Service was quick even though their was a full house.   Food was good pizza; pasta and salads were ordered.  They will customized if you ask. Romaine instead of iceberg lettuce ad well done pizza. There loyalty program reward frequent diners with free items.  Nice place for a casual meal out! [REVIEW_5] first time trying coffin nail style and i'm so in love! Great customer service!! def recommend !! [REVIEW_6] I live near Baltimore but get to Philly occasionally.  When I do; I try to get to Nicks.  Roast beef with cheese and gravy fries... Y U M M Y !  Good service; casual environment; and really good food. [REVIEW_7] YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY! This place is by far one of the best sushi restaurants I've ever been to; and I have been eating sushi since I was a little girl. Each meal was flavorful and delicious! From the miso soup to the two rolls my sister and I shared! Great service (Danelo); great food; and fast cooking! So thankful we decided to try this place out! Will be back [REVIEW_8] If you're reading this review you're most likely one of the following: somewhat new to the Pinellas County area; a snowbird looking for Honda service; new to the world of Honda; or you broke up with Honda years ago and realized it's time to go back to the best car you've probably ever owned...  Whatever the case; you're looking to avoid the trek into Tampa; right? This means you've got two options; AutoNation or Crown. Based upon personal experience (this happened to both my brother and husband); if you head to AutoNation first; you'll probably find yourself purchasing from Crown. Here's why.   From Service to Sales; They're There to Help. Ironically; I was helping Mom clean her three-year-old CRV interior. Her New York-dealership lease was up in two months (she moved here two years ago and needed to find a new trusted Honda dealership). Once the interior seats were clean; we were ready to hit the car wash. Boom. The three-year old battery died leaving us stuck in my driveway.  Honda roadside assistance towed the car to the dealership - at no charge of course. Crown offered to replace the battery for free allowing her time to think about her next move. Regardless; I was confident we'd roll out in a new Honda; but didn't want her to worry. She's dealt with Michelle and Brooks in service several times and knows they're both awesome; so having had positive experiences with them helped.  No Real Pressure. No Real Up-Sell. Karen handled our lease deal with management assistance from Vinny. She listened and understood that Mom; a senior; is far from tech savvy - bells and whistles scare her. Mom no longer deals with ice and snow - no need for four-wheel drive and needs to feel comfortable on the road. Her previously-leased 2012 Civic was too tight and too low to the ground. With all of this in mind; they set her up with a standard-feature H-RV crossover vehicle to reach her price point; style and comfort requirements.   Justin Simplifies the Finance Process You've found your ideal car thanks to Sales; now it's time to pay up. Oy; the stress; right? No. Justin puts you at ease with humor; warmth; and banter knowing the stress involved in coughing up the cash. When we told tell him Mom obviously didn't need a top-of-the line coverage plan on a leased car; but only trusts the dealership for service; he worked with her...  Ready to Rock and Roll Regardless of the dealership closing in thirty minutes; Karen sat with us in Mom's new H-RV and walked her through each and every feature. From actually setting up and testing her iPhone speed dial numbers via bluetooth; to setting up her quick-find favorite soft rock radio stations - every question was answered. I've had this with Volkswagen; but Mom said she's never experienced that with Honda.   Overall Positive Customer Experience  We left feeling great about the purchase. We liked getting to know the staffs' personal background - where they're from; details about their families; etc. Enjoyed complimentary cups of tea; coffee; cocoa; and bottled water - car shopping is serious business. We were there for four hours - keeping hydrated is key. Another reviewer said they make you feel like family and honestly; they did.   Sweet Sidenote Crown apparently loves animals. While out on the lot; we had the pleasure of meeting Oliver; a local orange and white outdoor-cat. Though his owner lives near the dealership; Oliver's made Crown his second home and the crew doesn't seem to mind sharing the outdoor space with him one bit. Loved this! [REVIEW_9] I LOVE this place! Great service; great tequila; great atmosphere! Try the pork tacos and guacamole. [REVIEW_10] I've been here 5 times; and ordered the Chicken Veracruz Salad. I love it! (Almost obsessed with it lol) The cashier/server has always been nice and helpful. I'll keep going back! [REVIEW_11] It was the first time of me being at a Korean BBQ place. We got both the hot pot and BBQ. It was like a buffet style; we got unlimited amount of food. The food was good; they had a lot of options. There was also a salad bar and a sauce bar. Would go back again. [REVIEW_12] Always a wonderful experience.  We never stay anywhere but the Peppermill because the hotel is consistently outstanding.  The rooms are beautiful; the staff is extremely professional and the restaurants are excellent.  The Peppermill gives you the Las Vegas experience without the long trip. . . and without the ridiculous crowds.  (Now if only I could learn how to win on the slots)  LOL [REVIEW_13] Visiting SB from the Midwest and after a long day in wine country; our host treated us to carry out Pizza Mizza.  All pies were tasty; but my favorite was the one with chicken; mushroom; and rosemary white sauce.  Not a combination I would have come up with; but they're the creative people.  Yum. [REVIEW_14] Stayed at the Holiday Inn while on vacation; and thought we would give it a try this place is beautiful! Right on water; big and lots to see. Live music was great! I expected great food to come out and what I got was frozen seafood!!! Ordered the calamari- looked great but tasted like frozen fried with no season at all!! Kids got chicken fingers and a burger which also taste frozen and the burger no joke tasted just like a frozen bubba burger you get from the store. Also got the Mango Mai Mai; this I thought for sure would be good but again the fresh was rubbery; over cooked tasted frozen; the baked potato tasted to be old. When it came time to pay; i have my server a $100 bill she brings me back change for a $50! Not cool at all! In all honesty the only thing this place is good for is drinks. I'm very disappointed in it ! I should have saved the money and walked over to Crabby Bills! [REVIEW_15] I travel to and through St Louis a few times a year; and Ted Drewes is a must-stop. Always a big crowd; but the friendly staff know how to move the people and keep the custard coming; so don't let a large crowd keep you from stopping by. I try a different specialty of theirs every time I go; and I'm never disappointed. Just the best custard ever! Very high quality ingredients and if I lived in St Louis; they would get a large portion of my income; as I wouldn't be able to help myself from going constantly. And did I mention how reasonably priced they are! I love this place. [REVIEW_16] My go-to spot for low key take out/sit in sushi.  Excellent food; quick turn around and contemporary inside.  Highly recommend.  Only suggestion would be to add much more soy sauce packets in the to-go bag :) [REVIEW_17] Horrible food; the pork was under seasoned. The queso was watery. I will not return. [REVIEW_18] Oh Ants Pants; you are the sunshine of our neighborhood.  Even though the selection of food isn't very vast; everything I've touched on the menu (which I'm pretty sure is all of it) is very; very good in a homemade meal way.  The staff is the greatest... from Paul to Teresa; to the owner herself.  They make you feel at home and never rushed.  They aren't afraid to voice their opinions on what is especially good that day; and take the time to small chat without seeming obligated.  There's a cute outdoor area in the back; and it's fairly easy to grab and go if that's your intention.  Beware that the place is small; but crowds seem to get in and out fairly quickly... mainly because the food comes out fast; hard to believe when only cooking on a couple burners and a toaster over.  The name Ants Pants can translate into The Bee's Knees in the US... I'm not really sure how either reference came into play; but it stands true at Ants Pants.  You'll end up being happy for half the day after eating here; and might meet some new friends along the way. Note: get the bacon stack; and any soup special they have. [REVIEW_19] Dined here because a friend kept telling me that the BBQ shrimp was a must! We made a reservation and specifically told the receptionist that we will have a baby in a stroller. When arriving right on time for our 6:30 reservation on Friday 07/17/15 the hostess had this mean face. I informed her that we had a reservation and provided her the information. In a not so friendly tone she asked me if everyone was present. We informed her no; but they were on their way. The door to the restaurant is one of those spiral hotel lobby doors. My dad didn't know how to get the stroller inside. The male hostess walked to the door and was informing my father to go around. When I saw they were here; I walked up to the mean women and informed her my party was complete. She watched with an even uglier face on as my father walked in with the stroller. She ignored me as she was watching him and I repeated twice that my party was complete. She finally decided to talk to me and informed me that the stroller cannot go by our table. I then replied that I specifically informed the receptionist about the baby. At that moment the hostess raised her hand to my face to tell me to stop. I was shocked and wanted to hit her hand out of my face. However; being in a nice place I kept it in and just walked away. The male hostess sat us at a table that had booth seating. He pulled the table out for some of us to slide in and he walked away! So the rest of the party pushed the table back. I then was telling my family how shocked I am about our dinner experience starting the way it did. Mr. B's is a more upscale and nice restaurant and I didn't feel the southern hospitality at all! I had better service the night before at ACME!   Our server Kevin & Renata then greeted us but being so heated I asked for the manager. EJ (Manager) came and I informed him of what happened. He offered to buy us our first round of drinks (which was very nice; but was not necessary).   Kevin & Renata were amazing! They turned our dinner completely around the recommended amazing dishes and treated us with respect. They both are great assets to Mr. B's restaurant. I dont leave 40% tips often; but when I do it's well deserved!  We ordered  Appetizers  1-1-1 soup Sampler  Entrees 2 BBQ Shrimps (AMAZING) Butter Truffle Filet (meat was good and very tender) Crawfish Ravioli (it was yummy but not as great as the other dishes) Bacon wrapped Shrimp & Grits (delicious the grits were so soft and melted in your mouth) Soft shell crab (yummy perfectly cooked not to hard and dry) [REVIEW_20] LOVE. This tiny place is consistent & personal. The staff is always prompt & very helpful. The quality & pride in food is my favorite part. They are definitely accomedating if you have any preferences. I had only two places I would eat sushi at while pregnant (sparingly) - this was one of them. The out door seating is a massive bonus on a nice day! [REVIEW_21] We had so much fun at this place! Lisa; Erika and and Sean  were phenomenal bartenders and really made our Saturday night the best. We will be bringing all our friends here to watch eagles games. Very friendly and makes you feel like home! [REVIEW_22] Marrakesh is a total package dining experience. Not only do you get to eat authentic Moroccan cuisine; you get to enjoy a cultural experience as well.   You may have walked past Marrakesh or the surrounding streets many times without even realizing it was there; like I had prior to this visit. It's nestled on Leithgow Street just a notch off of South Street. Forget South Street or even the rest of Philadelphia for that matter. You are about to step into a different world. To enter you must ring the doorbell on the side door.   I felt more like I was going to a house; than a restaurant; especially with the shower located in the restroom on the second floor. During my entire visit; I never felt like I was at a restaurant. I felt comfortable and relaxed. Maybe eating with your hands with a towel on your lap has that effect.   I found my group of fellow Yelpers in a cozy private room.  The room had four tables with booth seating along the outskirts of the room. Ottoman like chairs took up the rest of the space for the rest of us. With such a large group in not the largest of spaces; it got loud.  Our meal started with customary hand-washing and we were even entertained twice with a belly dancer. After placing our order; the food kept flowing. The service was probably the most unobtrusive service I've ever had. As one dish was placed in front of us; another was seamlessly removed. I felt like royalty or at least someone enjoying a nice meal at someone's dinner party. The regular dining formalities I'm used to were thrown out the window; and it was fantastic!   As I'm sure you're aware; this $25 prix fixe menu has seven courses and you are welcome to BYOB. While it was a ton of food; I walked in the door absolutely starving and walked out not overly stuffed. I believe most people left absolutely full; so maybe the tip is to come in extremely hungry. Here's a little rundown of dining experience:  Course 1: Three-Salad Platter- The eggplant is phenomenal (and messy). Luckily you have some assistance from the pita to eat it. The cucumbers and bell peppers and carrots and cucumber were good; but the eggplant stole the show.   Course 2: The B'stella- As someone who doesn't normally love sweets but loves cinnamon; carbs and meat; this dish was a winner. This dish was dough filled with chicken; nuts; almonds; egg; peppers and onions. It was really hot at first; but once you cracked open the shell and let it cool down; it was easier to eat. I had some pita saved from the first course; so I found it easy to break off a piece and rest it on the pita while it cooled down. Truly a sweet-savory delight.   Course 3: Chicken- So here's where the choices began. You can either get chicken with lemon or spicy chicken. My group opted to get the spicy chicken with the cumin sauce on the side. The chicken was melt in your hands and then melt in your mouth good. The spicy sauce had a nice kick without being overly spicy to me. I still had some pita leftover so I did a little dipping with the sauce.   Course 4: Beef or Lamb- My table got a little creative here and asked for half portions of both the beef and lamb. The beef was served shish kebab style; and to be honest; not my favorite. It was a little well done; and I struggled a little to get it off the stick resulting in a pepper flying into my husband's wine glass. Sauvignon blanc tastes best with a little pepper anyways; right? The lamb was perfect. Even the non-lamb eaters thought it was delicious. It was tender and took on the flavor of the chick peas and onions without having an overwhelming lamb flavor.   Course 5: Couscous with veggies; chick peas and raisins- This was probably my least favorite dish from the main meal. It was a little blander than other couscous dishes I've tried in the past. I would have been disappointed if this was the only thing I ordered; but everything was a hit thus far in the evening. They did give us spoons at this point; so don't worry about eating the little grains with your hands.  Courses 6 & 7: Dessert- I'm assuming the tea; fruit and pastries count as the sixth and seventh courses. At this point in the evening; my bottle of wine had been consumed and I wasn't counting the dishes; and am making this assumption while referencing the menu. I'm not a tea fan so I passed. The pastries were little crisp triangles that reminded me of baklava. The fruit came out frozen was a little hard to eat. I nibbled on a strawberry and took a banana for the road since the majority of the group passed on the fruit. Perhaps the fruit was customary; but I thought a little unnecessary. If it's part of the traditional meal then no harm; no foul.    To sum it up; I had delicious food and hours of fun. It's an experience not to be missed in Philadelphia; especially if you go with an adventurous group of friends. While I couldn't imagine going to Marrakesh every Friday night; I can definitely pick a handful of occasions that would be a perfect fit. [REVIEW_23] Never; ever disappointed here!  Jonathan is a master of combining unexpected favors; textures; and unique ingredients to yield a mouth orgasm.  Oh yes! [REVIEW_24] All earlier reviews were erased! so....Easily the best florist in the city! Michael; the owner; and his staff are absolute sweethearts and great at customer satisfaction. I am regular here; getting flowers for my sweetie at least twice a month and the staff always treat me like an old friend! Great selection of home goods and cool unusual plants.  Always helpful with any questions regarding plants and gardening; these guys rock. They do window boxes and small backyards as well; but beware they get booked up quickly so give them some time to get to you. [REVIEW_25] Wholeheartedly agree with the other 1 stars.  I ordered my graduation attire that I had to buy (if you are an academic; just need to have them). I signed an order form with an already outrageous amount on it (approaching $1000); and then they charged 15% more than that; unannounced. I tried to contact them but no response. I ended up filing a complaint with the division of consumer protection. Avoid if you can. [REVIEW_26] I prefer this Felix's over the French quarter. Much better food here than Brisbi's - they need a drink list. Excellent food & fun on the lakefront! [REVIEW_27] This is THE place to go in Nashville for Vietnamese!  No frills; family-run Vietnamese food that is simply great tasting.  Other places seem ""Americanized"" to me; but not KG.  Do not miss the spring rolls.  The Pho is particularly good; and the Bun bowls are excellent.  I'm also a big fan of the ""Pork chop lunch special""; but don't plan on needing to eat dinner afterward.  Finally; they make a mean lemongrass chicken meal. [REVIEW_28] I really enjoy this Mexican restaurant because it's Close to the house and we always have great service. The cheese sauce is good and the margaritas are tasty. This is the 1st place I have ever had tortilla chicken soup. It is really good. Chicken broth with chicken rice pico and fresh avocados on top. It's a huge bowl.  Their tacos are great too. [REVIEW_29] I honestly didn't know this place existed until my friend suggested it for brunch over the weekend. I can't believe I live four blocks away and haven't been here before! I ordered the honeybee crepe and an almond croissant. I'm one to typically bring leftovers home but the food was so delicious there was nothing left to take much to the surprise of my friends. There is a small seating area downstairs and some window seating on the first floor. I'd recommend getting there on the earlier side if you're with a group and want to sit. I'd also recommend this for smaller groups. Will definitely be going back. [REVIEW_30] These hand grenades don't play!! Thy definitely do the job for $12!   I would rather much have these than hurricanes. They taste more citrusy and pack a more sour punch. Because they're delicious and refreshing tasting; it'll keep you addicted. By the end of the bottle you'll be swirled up!!",26
21,"[REVIEW_1] The owner of this location (and two others including Southampton) reached out to me after my previous review. We ended up talking for half an hour and I was very impressed with his approach to business... he's definitely the type of person I want to do business with. I returned to Saladworks on two separate occasions and the service had vastly improved. The new summer salads are wonderful! [REVIEW_2] Great place! For the value ; condition; service; this is the place. Family owned which I will always support. Not the $80+ kind of place but feels like it. [REVIEW_3] This store is TERRIBLE.  I will only run in for one or two things if I absolutely have to.  I love WalMart but this one - no matter when you go (I've even been at 5am) you will wait FOREVER and 9 out of 10 times the clerk won't talk to you... at all.  I've gotten a significant amount of items that were out dated; however they do have good prices overall and there is good parking. Oh -the ATM NEVER works too. [REVIEW_4] The food was great; the service was quick; and the drinks were delicious. The servers have tablets now and it makes the food come out faster--someone actually brought drinks to our table while our server was still telling us about appetizers; how cool! [REVIEW_5] Dr. Wendy is a miracle worker and I go see her once a week. She is one of the best acupuncturists I have ever been to. I also love there acupressure massages. [REVIEW_6] Awesome spot and off the beaten touristy path in Nashville. Will be my first stop when I come back to visit [REVIEW_7] Delicious! My Burger Up experience was wonderful.  I went with a group of 3 and we were seated pretty quickly after all getting to the place. We had the fried pickles for an appetizer (delicious! thick-cut pickles); and sangria to begin our meal. The sangria changes daily/weekly; so ask about it.  Most of us had the woodstock burger (bacon; cheese; ketchup); and we all loved it! One person in my group had a veggie burger; and he ate the whole thing. The fries were also really good.  We finished our meal with the ice cream and cookies--very good!   Everything was tasty. I particularly liked our waitress--she offered great suggestions; was extremely knowledgable about the menu; and didn't mind us hanging around a bit longer than we probably should have. She was attentive on refilling our drinks; and she seemed happy. My experience was nice; and I hope to return to try a different burger. [REVIEW_8] Today I had my second appointment at this Salon. I had Drea for color and Morgan for cut. Morgan is at the $55 level. She did an awesome job and gave me exactly what I asked for. It turns out she and I have the exact same type of hair (fine and a lot of hair) so she knew just how to handle it. Drea did my color. I asked for my natural color and to cover my gray. The color turned out perfect. I had actually asked for something a tad darker but she knew that it would look it be a little extreme. What I got was perfect for my fair skin. I'll be back to see both ladies! [REVIEW_9] Called in to get service information on my 2015 $110K AMG. Was told since I didn't purchase the vehicle at their dealership that I would have to pay for a loaner car for warranty work. Will be staying far away from here. [REVIEW_10] My absolute favorite coffee place in Reno! Love everything here; including their mochas; lavender lattes; food (there's an AMAZING bread pudding). Great atmosphere where you can hang out with friends or study. Also love the Coffeebar in Truckee! [REVIEW_11] Bread tasted old and was dry. Beef had no flavor and there was hardly any provolone. This is a big disappointment and will definitely hurt the brand name over this airport excuse. [REVIEW_12] Due to it's location in a strip mall near Cool Springs; this version of the Twelve South hipster gourmet Burger Up is certainly not as trendy. But it makes up for it by delivering the goods. Awesomely tasty and messy burgers with fresh meat and fixings. The regular fries are delicious... until you try the truffle fries. They are truly outstanding; not greasy and finished with paresan cheese. The metaphorical cherry-on-top was the chocolate milkshake (which actually had no cherry on top). The shake was nothing fancy; but perfectly made; creamy; not too sweet or over-chocolatey.  If you want your upscale burger experience but still want your burger-fries-shake holy trinity; come here. [REVIEW_13] Fabulous; quick; stress free windshield repair. .. didnt cost a penny out of pocket. I would definitely use this company again and would recommend to anybody!! [REVIEW_14] I absolutely hate coming here to pick up a package. It's difficult to locate and they have terrible service. They are not even set up for customer traffic at all! And I only came here because it's impossible to set up a convenient time for a package delivery at my home. [REVIEW_15] Great food! Very impressed...I really like the brunch on the weekends. Chicken and waffles very good; avocado toast. [REVIEW_16] The French woman who owns the place ruined the experience for me.  She doesn't seem to have any respect for her stylists or staff.  Her concern was that halfway through my haircut; there was hair on the floor.  She whispered to my stylist to leave me and next thing I know my stylist is coming back with a broom to sweep up the hair. Who does that??  I have short hair; and not much of it so it looked like a really pissy move.  I felt intruded on; and such empathy for my stylist who; by the way; was the ultimate professional and gave me the best hair ever!  I don't patronize a salon; I faithfully follow a talented stylist.  Flamboyant untalented French lady ruins it for me every time.  Hoping my favorite stylist moves to another salon soon! [REVIEW_17] Best tortelloni I've ever had! The cream walnut sauce was my pregnancy craving; if I could afford it I would eat it every night! Charming atmosphere; great for a special night out. [REVIEW_18] Yeah; I know what you're thinking. One Wawa store is pretty much the same as another; so why even bother writing a review? But I think we have a winner here.  When this Wawa store opened for business; gas prices at gas stations all along Concord Pike fell by 30 cents per gallon just to compete with them. Sure; this Wawa store could've followed the general pricing in the area and lowered prices just a few cents; keeping the bulk of the profit. But no; they'll have none of that. I love a store that is on the side of my wallet!  Secondly; I love the automatic start/stop digital air pump. So far; I've only seen that at BJ's Wholesale and Sheetz. It's a snap to use and I get the exact tire pressure every time.  As for service; they seem nice and relatively efficient. The internal layout of the store is the new style that I first saw in Newark. Having separate non-cigarette cashier lines may speed things up in peak periods; although I've never been there during the day; so I wouldn't know. [REVIEW_19] New Mexican restaurant!!! An exceptional culinary experience!. When you arrive ask for ""El Jefe"" Margarita to start made with Don Julio. The Ceviche is insane. My wife had the Carnitas taco; I enjoyed the Carne Asada... OMG!!!! [REVIEW_20] LOVE imperial. best snoballs around. anna and maddie are the best employees. also we stan frank. [REVIEW_21] A downtown without a bookstore is like a downtown without... I don't know I lost the metaphor. It's just sad is what it is. You need books; you need a place to browse; talk with other book lovers; and listen to book readings. Indy Reads is that place. And it's more than that because all proceeds support a great cause; adult literacy. Most of the books are used so donate a book and pick up a new (used) one. You may be surprised at all the books they have that you didn't even know you wanted. They also have a small selection of new books. If they don't have what you're looking for; you can order it. The one thing I don't really like is that the $1 children's books can be jammed so tightly that it's hard to look through them. The kids books are also arranged by color; which makes it harder for me to distinguish between titles as I glance through. Prices are excellent throughout; and the space is really nice. Check it out! [REVIEW_22] Cake Bake is a must-visit if you are in Indy! Not only is the cake amazing; but the entire experience of your lunch/tea date/after-school treat is one of a kind. Every single detail is perfection. From the edible glitter on the cakes; brownies and cookies to the ornate silverware and platters to the French champagne; to the pink receipt paper; you will be in pretty pink princess heaven! It is over the top in the best kind of way. So fun for a girls date; bridal shower or a mommy and me outing. Today we celebrated with Red Velvet and 'Millionaire' cake and the sparkling (literally with floating glitter!) lemon lavender champagne as my sister found her dream wedding dress at a local bridal shop. Such a fun time! [REVIEW_23] It was my first time here. I love the wild boar burger with the duck bacon. OMG! It was so interesting. Duck bacon I never heard of it before. I'll be going back. I also sweet potato fries. [REVIEW_24] Garbage. I ordered a TV from pilot on December 4th with an arrival estimate between Dec 8th-15th. The day of the 15th before 8:00pm. I took off work to wait for my TV and at 6:15 on the 15th they called me to schedule a delivery but the package arrived the day before on the 14th. They told me the quickest they could have it delivered & to me was by was in another 5 days. Come to find out I could have picked it up; only about 10 minutes from my house. AVOID PILOT at all costs. [REVIEW_25] Yay!!!  St. Louis finally has a West Elm!  The store is big; salespeople are friendly and--at least for a limited time--students get 10% off their entire order.  The only downside is having to schlep large purchases through the mall to the parking lot. [REVIEW_26] I took my car to have the left headlight replaced; in Oct 2015. the price was reasonable. I had to take my car again in Dec 2015; because the headlight wasn't installed correctly(facing downward) it was fixed (no charge). And then again back to Sears auto Jan 27th because my headlight had gone out! At this point my blood is boiling! Because of employee negligence! Couldn't get it right the 1st time! Although I will say I wasn't charged; not that I would have paid for a headlight that I had already paid for 3 months ago! My headlight on the drivers side was replaced 2 yrs ago and as of today has not been replaced! Smdh.  I will NEVER TAKE MY CAR HERE AGAIN! Stay away!! Small details were overlooked. Needless to say; I didn't get good customer service and it's a good distance from my home; but close to my work. [REVIEW_27] Oh man! This is the best BBQ shrimp I have ever eaten! The bread pudding is creamy; crispy edged deliciousness! Our server; Ishmael; was the cream of the crop! [REVIEW_28] We can't wait to come back!  Okay so we decided to come to New Orleans for my 30th birthday and stay with The Ace. We asked for a few things to be in the room before we arrived and Oz at the front desk went so far above and beyond to make that happen for us. Literally what a star.   Allison and Cici helped us out during our stay as well and both are rock stars. Sadly; these are the only names I have but I can say that everyone was so nice to us and made our stay so wonderful.   The rooms are spacious and perfect for the vibe of the hotel. Great products in the bathroom; comfy beds and blackout curtains perfect for sleeping in. They're totally hooked up for music with a record player as well as an intuitive Bluetooth set up. Awesome minibar with all the fixings and a full fridge; which was great to have for all the leftover fried food you accumulate in Nola.   We didn't get a chance to eat at the restaurant; but it looks adorable. The lounge has super yummy cocktails and there is usually complimentary popcorn to snack on. Attached is a Stumptown Coffee which was so convenient for us as we head out to explore!   There's a rooftop pool and bar/restaurant called Alto that is so fun! Heads up; it is open to the public so it can get crowded. That said; we didn't have a hard time finding some chaises to set up on. The Eternal Summer was my favorite drink up here.   We actually made it to the gym. Once. It was great - clean towels; cold water; full set of weights and a couple treadmills. All good but we didn't spend much time here.   I think that covers it! Really looking forward to returning. [REVIEW_29] Awesome! The food; the service; the ambiance. Just wow! Had the BEST queso empanadas; fantastic yuca fries; amazing sangria--all served by a friendly and knowledgeable waitress (Lauren). Just loved it! We'll be back! [REVIEW_30] 72-acre park west of the intersection of Averitt Road and Stop 18!  I adore this park; brand new paths and great for bikes; runners; walkers; and dogs!!",23
22,"[REVIEW_1] Great beer selection. Great food; (the pizza is actually really good). Comfortable bar and restaurant seating; indoors and out. Very friendly staff.  Location is not in Westchase; but convenient to Westchase. [REVIEW_2] Went here because my mother-in-law goes here and I'm in town visiting. When we arrived; I told one of the techs there what I needed (a fill; 1 nail repair and gel polish). She told me to pick a color; I did and had a seat to wait. There were 5 techs seeing 5 customers so clearly I knew there was a wait. Instead of telling me to either come back or give me an estimated time it would be until I was seen; one tech told me to have a seat at a station. She then began to set the station up as if she were getting ready to start my service. Instead; she set the station up; then walked BACK to her client and continued their service and just had me waiting...what? Why not tell me to come back in a few hours or tomorrow or simply let me know how long it would be. I've always had a tech communicate with these things with a client. Customer service alone; it was NOT a good experience for me. [REVIEW_3] Wow has this place turned around. I've been going in weekly for quick print jobs. The staff is on top of it; courteous and helpful. Very impressed! [REVIEW_4] Love this place! The turkey; beans; and biscuits are amazing. Have had better pecan pie but that won't stop me from coming back :) [REVIEW_5] Best one stop print shop! All the employees here are extremely knowledgeable; helpful and friendly. These guys have made me art for my home; A-frames for my business and so much more. The quality on everything that I've received is top notch and I have no complaints about pricing. This is the only place I go to for any of my advertising. [REVIEW_6] One of best Thai; Malaysian ; Chinese food in Philadelphia . Ecnomical; fresh; nice service; quick and efficient staff . Trendy; you would see a lot of hippy crowd; sometimes gets noisy- nice hosts; better staff- English is a little bit issue with the staff-   It's in the heart of Philly ( Chinatown ).   Been here many times; I recommend it. Try their tea at the beginning which is free of charge.  Update : 6/17/2017. Staff was pushy; came thrice if we are done with the food- they just want you to leave as soon as possible. May be this is common in Chinatown - [REVIEW_7] Omg! Best Cajun Mac and cheese ever! Truck was parked outside of Tipitinas after a show. He gave us a huge sample of their mac and I was blown away. A must!! [REVIEW_8] Dr Kaplan is smart; knowledgable; and very personable. My wife and I have been coming here for two years. The staff is very accommodating as well. We have seen Dr Charles Kaplan and NP Lana Kessler and are very happy with both of them. Great practice! Highly Recommend! [REVIEW_9] Big fan of this place and don't know why it's not overflowing with people. Aside from the many delicious burger/sandwich items on the menu; you can create your own burger with a huge array of options to choose from; including: bison; wild boar and elk! The space inside is open; light and airy; a little kitschy albeit. They have a bar in the back and a few TVs also spaced around the restaurant. Servers were friendly and attentive. Great place for a good quality burger. [REVIEW_10] Was not expected much; until we arrived the it was packed outside. Not only was it packed but they were extremely efficient. The custard was great I did not think it was overly sweet and some what light. I had the tiramisu with pistachio and that was good. Kind of their version of it but none the less great! Would definitely go back when I am in town! [REVIEW_11] ""Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels""...except for Huddles.    This place is great!  Cheap...no.  Delicious...yes.  I don't eat ice cream or frozen yogurt on a daily basis so I'm okay with the splurge.    I love all the different flavors of fro yo that they have!!  Every time I go there is something different and I can always find something that I want.  I wish I could remember all the flavors I've had but it's like every time I take a spoonful; I black out from the heavenly taste of it.    I like the fact that they tell you which ones are low fat and which ones are fat free.  It's definitely hard to resist not getting a mass quantity since the cups are so big but I'm getting better at the portion control.  It's just so easy!    The punch cards are awesome and I love that they let the 3 of us who always go together always punch the same card all at a once.  Some places make you have a card per person and I hate that.    I'm already a Colts fan but I like to think that every trip to Huddles is just another way to show my love to the team. [REVIEW_12] Called in a Mediterranean chicken shawarma. Good flavor and they were generous with the amount of chicken in the pita. The food was ready to go when I arrived. Good service. I would revisit the next time I am in the area. [REVIEW_13] I went here today because all week I've been experiencing swelling in my wrists; neck; face; achiness and burning in my arm; and generally not feeling right. I did the usual paperwork; had to pay up front; which had I been able to pay afterwards. I probably would have left and gone to Lankenau. So; the MA who came in and asked me questions was cool; personable.... My blood pressure was insanely high; which I have never experienced before (168 over 135) and I got panicky; as the alarms and crap were dinging;... The MA definitely recognized my concern; and listened pretty well.  The Dr came in and I went  thru my list of symptoms and he totally blew me off; I  said even the fact my blood pressure was sky high wasn't a bit alarming;....He said no; I have anxiety. Made me out to be a hypochondriac; which totally isn't the case; I've fallen off rooftops and walked junk off like the queen of england. He then asks are you tired...Yeah I'm tired ; I work full time in a hospital and waitress part time; and I walk like a million miles a day; but I feel crappy now more so than usual.   He palpates my belly and asks a few more questions; then says well I think you may have mono.... But there isn't much we can do about that.... I asked if he could run an epstien barr heterophile blood test to see...He said it wasn't neccesary. Um....Ok. ""Tthere isnt much that we can do about that anyway""... Great. He says I strained my wrist. I'll get you an ace bandage....Well what about the mono possibility....ande the fact my blood pressure was insanely high....Once again he gives me this look like listen you dirty little tattooed hood rat...you have no idea what your talking about..... ""Your a perfectly healthy twenty seven year old. Your fine. You have anxiety problems; you checked off depression on your chart....."" Um. Ok. So I then wait half an hour for an ace bandage while the chick runs around bitching how they don't have any supplies; never can get anything done....(reassuring) I mean; to be fair; I probably could have gotten a better physical at my apartment considering I have a broken wheelchair;a blood pressure cuff; a buncha vacutainers; some cough syrup; and part of a trach tool kit (don't ask me and my brother work in healthcare;....and kinda hoard stuff...) So I finally get my ace bandage and ask the girl if she can take my blood pressure...SHe says she can't find a stethescope. I ask a dr passing by if he can and he pretty much laughs in my face. ""Aren't you leaving?""  Um; ok. ""why do you want your blood pressure checked?"" ""Because it was insanely high when I came in on the machine; and I was hoping a manual read would prove different"" So; in less than good humor; he pretends like he's checking my pressure (I know how to use a blood pressure cuff; he didn't set it on the right numbers or place the stethescope in the correct area....) He says  ""It's like 110 over 90. Why; do you feel ok?"" Whatta mess. For the record; my brother and boyfriend took my pressure; it's still high; and now I'm out 70 bucks and all I got was a steam punk piece of junk arm brace that I'll probably be wearing in a casket judging by these reviews. [REVIEW_14] FINALLY!!!! A true non-GMO organic juice and power juice bar joint that serves MEATS & protein! THEY HAVE ORGANIC CHICKEN!!! I was so excited I ordered a second entree to take home! Great for Bulletproof Diet and Paleo peeps... [REVIEW_15] I had falafel sandwiches when they had a special. They were huge; filling and tasted amazing!!! [REVIEW_16] Best sandwiches in St.Louis! Could eat here everyday. Always a very friendly crowd when I come and eat here. [REVIEW_17] This place is really nice to get away from the Bourbon St. Environment. We arrived in a room filled with a nice selection of wine; cheese; and prosciutto. We proceeded to the outdoors patio awaiting our cheese and prosciutto. The platter was well setup and delicious. The patio has fans that kept us cool while the wine numbed our toes. Music selection was awesome too. We traveled upstairs and grabbed another glass of wine. They serve a great selection mixed drinks. The male bartender upstairs was not as friendly as the rest of the staff; however we came for the booze and appetizers. We definitely recommend this place for a getaway from the touristy areas. [REVIEW_18] We just moved to Narberth and had our first meal at this neighborhood gem. What a wonderful surprise. This restaurant is quiet and unassuming. When you enter it is busy; warm and down to earth. The service was excellent and the food a fantastic surprise. I enjoyed the Rosemary Chicken and Artichoke over Bowtie Pasta. It was savory; fresh and fragrant with herbs. My dinner partners enjoyed their dishes; too-  Shrimp with Andouille Sausage; Grilled Wild Striped Bass and a Veal dish. There were many homemade dessert options. We tried a generous portioned Chocolate Mousse cake. Definitely recommend this place and will return to check out the weekend brunch menu! [REVIEW_19] Simply put there is only one thing I care about when it comes to chiropractors; how do I feel after going and how do I feel days after going etc.  I just started going here and the answer is I feel significantly better; and it lasts longer after each visit which is what I expect.  Another good thing is they will not try and get you to come in 3 times per week like some Chiros; which is something I do appreciate. [REVIEW_20] I love coming here to do my smog on my cars great service and chipper then most!!! I totally recommend this place. [REVIEW_21] It really upsets me that Five Star pizza does NOT have five stars. Really great pizza. Do not get the cinnamon bite things. The pepperoni bites are super yummy. Their pizzas are very large and nicely priced. Always coupons/deals on their website when you order. Food is usually ready to be picked up in 20-30 minutes. Their staff sucks but just I ignore it. [REVIEW_22] We were happy to discover Luke thanks to the concierge at the Hilton that recommended it. We were hesitant to try it since it was adjacent to the hotel. Shame on us. We quickly discovered that celebrate chef John Besh ran the place and it truly was hopping. Our first visit was for happy hour shortly after we landed in New Orleans. Half price oysters and drinks; you can't go wrong. We quickly reordered another dozen as they were fresh and the sauces ere great. The sazerac was delicious.They have a nice wine and beer list too. We didn't originally order the fries but the table next to us were enjoying them and they looked so good; we had to try. We weren't disappointed. We liked Luke so much that we went back for Christmas day brunch. Equally good. Note that you really need a reservation at any time of the day. It's always busy. They say that you can wait and sit at the bar but it's packed too. If you call and they say that they are fully booked; try opentable; it seems like there are tables hidden away and available. [REVIEW_23] Went in looking for some Benjamin Moore paint colors we had picked out online - the worker worked with us to find all of the colors we had picked and then suggested similar ones to the ones that we had picked.  Great experience! [REVIEW_24] Awesome place!   I wish I had one closer to where I live. Homemade Italian breads and desserts in all different shapes and sizes.   Great subs and pizza Great place a must stop [REVIEW_25] I've been going to Mark for at least 2 years now. I've gone to salons like Dominic Michael etc and am used to paying $35 plus tip for a cut. I learned about Blades and since I knew the owner had salon experience felt comfortable trying him. Mark is a great guy and I always love my cut. [REVIEW_26] Okay; I'm obsessed with the chocolate pancakes from IHOP but they are not worth it when the service is SHIT. My server comes to the table asked me what I wanted to order for a drink; I ask a few questions about the mimosas. He said ""No just Orange juice and Champagne"" I say then I'll getting something else AND HE WALKED AWAY BEFORE I COULD FINISH MY SENTENCE. I was appalled. This man was older so he had no excuse for his ignorance. I am so disappointed with this establishment. If I could give negative stars I would. Do not go here; it is not worth it. [REVIEW_27] Dave was very nice and explained the menu; the dogs were whipped up fast and were delicious; hit the spot. Dave's special; pizza dog and a custom creation were all excellent and he threw in some grilled jalapeños too. Santa Barbara desperately needs more late night food carts like this. [REVIEW_28] We hired Minuteman to re-key our new home as well as add deadbolts as needed.  They were prompt; courteous; and friendly.  We will definitely use Minuteman in the future. (Meridian; ID) [REVIEW_29] This place is awesome. Awesomely expensive; but a good splurge for Sure [REVIEW_30] Freaky fast as always.  Got the JJ Gargantuan and it was made within 3 minutes.  Barely had time to fill my own drink.  Love the new location with this Jimmy John's.  It is clean; the associates are very friendly (greeting me on the way in and on the way out) and the place is full of funny and entertaining signs to read while you eat.  I am sure that this place will stay busy being located right off of I-465 and by many work places.  My only regret...I forgot to get a pickle!",27
23,"[REVIEW_1] Local to St. Pete and finally visited for the first time tonight - we will not be back.  We started wondering if Ted Peter's is associated with that place Dicks Last Resort where the staff is intentionally miserable.  While there was one server who was friendly (taller blond with a braided ponytail); the rest of the staff were simply unhappy people.  The majority of the time we were there they moped around behind the counter like zombies where a TV was on with the news.  Smiles were met with grumpy faces; waves from a smiling 17 month old were met with a obvious turn the other way; questions were met with short and unpleasant answers - it was depressing to say the least.  To say it nicely; the staff all need some hugs- as someone previously mentioned about Carl (again except for the blond with braided ponytail; she was pleasant). If you are looking to bring out of town guests to Ted Peter's; I don't recommend it. If the experience was like ours tonight; your guests will certainly leave with the wrong impression of the people of St. Pete. [REVIEW_2] I don't know this for sure; but my first impression of this place is that it is run by unscrupulous people. Come along with me; as I journey back in time -- all the way back to Wednesday...  I step foot in this 7 Eleven; and the first thing I think is: this is one of the nicest looking 7 Elevens I've ever seen. It is very clean; bright; and spacious. Very nice looking selection of prepared meals. There were many that actually looked like they'd be quite good. But I wasn't hungry this day. No. All I needed were a few items.   First; some good old TP. And let me be perfectly clear (as clear as Barack Obama): I DON'T buy the cheapest toilet paper because I'm cheap. I buy it because I like the way the cheap stuff feels. The more like sandpaper; the better. I like to feel like its working. I don't need to or even want to feel like an angel is up there. Or some perverted freak named Scott.   In any case; I got myself 4 rolls. And then I just needed one more thing - some plastic cups for a little party I'm having this weekend.   I go ahead and drop my stash on the counter; begin to extract several singles from my wallet; when the cashier looks at me and says; ""24.99.""  I respond; ""That's not right.""  He points at a price tag on the plastic cups which reads 19.99. I begin laughing. I tell him the price is clearly wrong. He tells me he's got to talk to his manager. Meanwhile; I tell the folks behind me waiting in line that I'm just going to go run and get different plastic cups to hurry the process along. Before he got back from doing his price check; I already had another cashier ringing up my two sleeves of cups for 1.99 each. That's more like it.  At around that same moment; the first cashier comes back from his consultation with his manager. He tells me that the price was; in fact; incorrect. And that the price is actually 14.99.  THAT'S the unscrupulous part.  CLEARLY; THAT price is also far too high. His manager did no actual price check at all. He simply told the cashier to pretend that the real price was actually 5 dollars less; thinking that I'd be stupid enough to accept this. Why; because I'm white; and you're a racially superior Indian? You think white people are stupid don't you? We'll just believe what you tell us; and fork over our money. [REVIEW_3] i go here 3-4 times a week as it is around the corner from work but no more. the staff are rude and the owner is the worst. the old lady that is their every day was compaling that he was not in and she was all by her self and i can see where is was coming from as 12 people were in line and it took over 20 minutes to order my sub. the owner did arrive finally when i was second in line and he actually took my order. he asked me what do you want (extreamly rude but this is not the worst) which i replied a FT long honey oat with buffalo chicken he then asks what bread i once again say honey oat foot long and then he says ok ft long what type of bread do you want? i said this is the third time i have told you honey oat. he got the picture YAY! he put the cheese on and toasted the sub. he then said what else do you want (i am shocked by the rudeness) but i just don't say anything except lettuce tomato cucumber so he puts the lettuce and cucumbers on and forgets the tomato. i have just about had enough so i said stop slow down(he was rushing and not paying attention to what is going on and the lady told him I said tomato and she was making some one elses sub) and listen to what i am saying because i should not have to keep repeating my self. his reply is so do you want this sub? i said yes i do and i do not appreciate the attitude because i have been waiting over 20 minutes because you were late to work. his reply was do not speak to me like that and i just lost it. i did not swear at him i just explained how unprofessional he is being and the fact his consists of making a sub and he does not have the capacity to do so. he then asks again do want the sub i reply yes of course i need to eat lunch sometime today. he then throws my sub in the bin and says get out. during this 4 or 5 people walked out because of his attitude. its fair to say i will not be going back ever again! STAY AWAY! [REVIEW_4] Where I think the meat and fish selection looks fine and they carry some exotic meats in the freezer I just cannot recommend this place. I had purchased a Groupon and was pretty excited about trying this place out. When I got there I decided to walk around the entire store to see what kind of goodies I wanted to buy. Once I got around to the back of the store buy the beer; wine and dried goods I started to smell the stench of cigarettes. At first I was willing to write this off as maybe a door was open by the loading dock. But then I walked by the office with the door wide open and two people smoking openly. I choose to ask them why they were smoking in the building and all they could do was write it off as ""smoking in the office"" and ""yeah it's a dirty habit"". Not addressing that it's ILLEGAL in the state of Florida to smoke inside a business like this; you know the whole Indoor Clean Air Act. Besides I don't want to buy what is supposed to be fresh meat and the like in a place that cigarette smoke lingers in the air. The only reason I bought anything was to use my Groupon but on second thought I should have just walked out empty handed.   I don't think they understand the purpose of Groupon. It is designed to get new customers in the door with the goal of becoming regular customers. In this case they scared me away from ever shopping there again. What a shame they could have something pretty nice on their hands otherwise. [REVIEW_5] Had the worst experience with the part owner woman that took off my acrylics yesterday. She literally shaved down with the drill my entire natural nail to the skin on 2 fingers completely and leaving spots of skin on other nails.  I am scared I will get an infection. I am left with very painful nails and very damaged nails. This place should be closed down for such inexperienced owners. I thought I had the best; since she said she was part owner. She totally did not know how to take off acrylics.If my fingers end up infected; trust me you will hear from me and I will make sure you are liable. [REVIEW_6] After a long trip where we stayed at many hotels this is by far the worst and more expensive then two we stayed at.   This hotel fails to get the simple things right and when you fail at that everything else is secondary.   Customer experience: Phase two of the customer experience was the beginning of the issues. There was no clear signage to direct you to the valet when we arrived at 10:30 pm which caused me to circle the block to make another pass and find it.   Phase three the AC system is not adequate at all to cool the room; I set the thermostat to 65 degrees in the living room and the bedroom was still hot and not just for me but my girlfriend as well. The curtains do not block out the sun as they don't close all the way. So instead of a nice long sleep I can't sleep with the heat then the sun bright in early through the window wakes us up.   At this point I got up to take a shower which is one with the horrible cheap shower curtains that divide halfway up. I got the shower curtain with the one half inside the shower and the other half outside. When I finished the shower the floor was soaked. It's annoying because I specifically took the time to get that stupid cheap shower curtain setup right and it still leaked everywhere.   Hopefully they will buy real shower curtains; upgrade the AC; and fix the blinds so people can get a good rest but after this night I'm done with Embassy Suites Tampa.  The wifi does not work so don't stay here if you need to get work done unless you use cellular data like I did.  As we were leaving I noticed all the black hold on the wall in the living room area. Pictures attached. [REVIEW_7] Probably one of the WORST experiences I've had in a restaurant :( Let me just start off saying; the food is good! Nothing wrong with any of the food; the chefs are amazing and we all enjoyed our food. The problem was with the service....  We made a reservation for 9 at 7:15 and we ended up getting their around 6:45. We were told we needed to wait because there wasn't enough chefs; which is TOTALLY fine and understandable. Then the woman at the front seats a party of 2 and another party of 3. So I asked why they were able to sit down before our group (and by this time it was about 7-7:10) and she told me because they had a smaller group.... Okay well if we had a reservation wouldn't we be first to sit down? We didn't care if the chef wasn't ready we just wanted to sit down order drinks and have some appetizers. We were then seated and our server Ivan came over very promptly which was nice. After he got our first round of drinks this is where things went down hill.   We ordered some sushi; simple sushi. Salmon; and shrimp. We ordered 2 rolls; a crunch roll and a shrimp tempura roll. He brought out yellowtail; tuna and 2 veggie rolls. I kindly said that the food wasn't ours and that wasn't what we ordered. He told me that it was and that I was wrong. So I asked to see the sushi paper because maybe I marked the wrong thing. And then he said he threw the paper away but he took the sushi away with a HUGE attitude and said he would go try and find the paper. Well our group could see him in the back area and he pulled the paper out of his apron and came over and said oh yeah I guess it was my fault I brought you guys the wrong stuff.... Okay that's what we tried explaining! The stuff finally comes out and tasted perfect! So then some of us ordered the teppan and we got our miso soup and then once that was done we got our salad. None of us had forks and I'm pretty sure maybe 1 out the 9 of us knew how to use chopsticks so I asked for forks and he said yeah no problem. Well we waited out 10 minutes until we saw him again and couldn't find any other servers to ask for their help so we ended up just eating with our fingers. We finally see Ivan and asked for forks again and he said; ""do you honestly need them right now? Your food isn't being cooked!"" EXCUSE ME! I was so furious that he would even come back with such attitude. All of the girls needed forks and so we told him; yes we need them now. I almost got up to go find them myself! Anyways; chef comes; food turned out good and no Ivan to be found for about 30 minutes. So 2 girls in our group asked for boxes; myself included; and it took him about 15 minutes to get them so I ended up eating the last bit of food I was going to take home. So when he brought my box I said; ""I'm sorry; I don't need the box anymore I finished what I was going to take home; but thank you!"" (very politely) He then came back with ""ok well maybe if I take your plate away you'll stop changing your mind"" WHAT IN THE HELL!!!! At this point I was done trying to be nice. After2 and half hours I was so glad to be leaving! Ivan was so rude to ALL of the girls in our group! I hope if we go back; which we probably won't; that Ivan will not be there. I always try and give people the benefit of the doubt and maybe he was having a bad day; but if your day is that bad; don't come into work and be mean and rude to your customers. I work with the public and believe me; it's hard to always please everyone. But it's unacceptable to be rude to people!! [REVIEW_8] Over price and pretentious hipster food . 4 bite of nothing on my small tasteless snapper.  The carnitas my daughter got where tasteless. [REVIEW_9] What a dive! It took the new owners no time to return Kelly's back to its dive status of yesteryear. The food is so-so. It's dumpy and smelly. The floor is sticky. The tables and chairs are a mess. The silverware is grungy. Not fit for anyone but drunken college kids Best to go to a restaurant if you want to keep your appetite and eat. This is just a place to watch kids puke out front; if that's what you;re into. [REVIEW_10] 1) carpet is sticky 2) didn't give us enough towels 3) phone doesn't work to call down to front desk 4) we asked them to clean our room five times; never happened 5) asked for sheets and blankets for the pull-out bed at least eight times; never happened. Don't waste your money here. [REVIEW_11] OK; so we never actually got our food... Or our menus for that matter; which was very disappointing. Staff was rude and the dining room looked like a dive.  I heard such good things about this place and since we were checking out a band next door last night; we thought we'd go in and try this local soul food restaurant people have been raving about.  I went in with a small group of four. We stood by the door waiting to be seated for a good 5 minutes. But no staff was in sight. So we thought maybe this is one of those establishments where you seat yourself... So we did.  We sat close to the front and waited. Finally; a waiter came into the room. He looked right at us and kept walking - OK; guess we're not at his station. We waited again. Another waiter came in; she acknowledged us; but never came over. A third waiter came in - we must have been seated for 15 minutes at this point and still no service has come to the table -- not even to give us a ""I'll be right back"" explanation - he apparently wasn't our waiter either.  At this time another couple walked in - it looked like they were deciding whether they liked the place (it has a ""dive restaurant"" feel to it). One waiter sees the couple and points to a table for them to sit at. The couple still talking amongst themselves did not see the waiter signaling (why didn't he just walk up to them? Makes no sense). The waiter says; very loudly and rudely with an annoyed tone and expression; ""heeelllloooo!"" When they heard that; they left... And so did we because still; nobody had came to our table and we didn't want to miss our band because of some sub-par waiters who were struggling to handle a half empty dining room.   Too bad. Heard the food was good.  We ended up going to a place down the block( it was right next to d.b.a.)  the food was awesome; staff friendly; they had live music and we only ended up  spending about $150 for 4. [REVIEW_12] Breakfast was vile; everything tasted like grease! [REVIEW_13] Extremely slow service (20 mins in an EMPTY drive thru) and first time around they missed a full half of my order! I come back and they're less than apologetic and proceed to give me 90% of my order! What does it take for a girl to get what she pays for around here?!! Not coming to this location again; just horrible. [REVIEW_14] Every dam time we come here it's an issue!!! Either the steak isn't cooked right or hair in the plate or a piece of something in the kitchen got in the plate smh I try always giving the benefit of the doubt but this is far beyond that!!! The manager don't even care.. all he said was sorry instead of saying hey we will cook it to your liking or do you want something else instead!!! Nope he just came to the table and said oh sorry and walked away!!!!    His name is Amonte or something like that!!!  I don't mind paying whatever for a good meal but this is ridiculous!!!! The waitress on the hand was awesome!!! [REVIEW_15] Don't expect housekeeping on a Saturday because this is an extended stay hotel and I wouldn't expect too much from the management either. After several phone calls and no answer from the front desk we just gave up and said never again for this hotel......lesson learned. [REVIEW_16] Went there on a Tuesday with my minivan; which ended up being Senior Discount Day. They didn't tell me before I paid that they won't clean or vacuum 3rd rows on Senior days. I got the Super wash; which included wax. They handed it over with large dirt smudges on the side; like it hadn't been wiped at all. A couple cup holders were barely touched and Some not at all in the front. The rest of the vacuuming wasn't good; with paper scraps still on the floor. I talked with the manager about the 3rd row and why didn't they tell me upfront when I pulled in. He said; ""I won't do your 3rd row on Senior Day. That's the way we've been doing it for 15 years."" I said I was new to the area and he said; ""That's too bad."" What kind of customer service is that?!? I usually don't write reviews; but this place was that bad. [REVIEW_17] The kid at the front desk refused to get a manager or supervisor after I asked. The kid named derick told me I was touchy...very rude. Turns out the supervisor was nearby and I talked to him. (They all gave me different info so I gave up). The AC did not work properly in room. The restaurant and breakfast ran out of certain food items. The valet parking(only parking there) was backed up. They werent ready for a busy week but they were ready to jack up the price. [REVIEW_18] Worst Italian restraint I ever been to. Took 15 minutes for someone to wait on us and she walked by us 4 times. No personality. The food was Luke warm and old or burnt was the worse I ever had. [REVIEW_19] I'm not particularly a fan of the Century Hospitality restaurants and I hadn't been to a Deluxe BB location in a few years so I decided to give it another shot the other week.   The atmosphere is cool but when you bite into the burger it is such a let down. Their overpriced burgers (and sides) are so disappointing that it brings tears to my eyes. Nobody in my party enjoyed their eats and nobody would come back.   The burgers sounds delicious from the description but in reality they are boring; dry; and void of any sort of flavor. I don't know how the Century Group can keep these locations afloat let alone keep expanding.   It's really not that hard to make even a decent burger and somehow Deluxe Burger Bar fails. DO NOT GO. [REVIEW_20] Went to Winco to purchase my weeks worth of groceries; It was about 6pm on a weekday. Spent about 45 minutes to an hour picking out my items; stood in a long line for about 20 minutes; when I got to the front of the line the cashier turned off her light and said I'm closed but were opening another check stand one over. Everyone that was behind me ran to the new checkstand and I was left in the back of the line for a 2nd time. Now it took 40 minutes to check out instead of 20. When I got home my ice cream was all melted. If this happens again I will walk out and let them put the groceries away. [REVIEW_21] The food was good but towards the ends my family and I were splitting the bill and they charged my family the the right amount but ran my credit card last and charged me the full amount of $250 I talked with the director and all he can say is i don't know what to say we'll refund it but will take a few days. I don't have of couple of days for $250.  I told them I'm not from here and I just can't come back if something is wrong and all the director could say is sorry can't help you. [REVIEW_22] What a drag. Entrees (bolognese and lasagne) are too salty. Lemoncello cake is just sponge cake with strawberry sauce now.  Drove here from Franklin with high expectations and won't be back.  Salmon was blackened as expected but terribly over cooked to the point of being dry as shoe leather.  Sad. [REVIEW_23] Update; it's been well over a month now; but multiple attempts to get It Can Fit to come fix/replace the couch have failed. They haven't even bothered responding to my review and even if I get them on the phone; I can't rely on them to stick to any appointments they offer.  If you are looking to move soon; my advice would be to find a more professional mover way ahead of time. These guys (ICF) were available last minute and I decided to bite with the lower rate that they quoted; but do yourself a favor and plan your move ahead of time and don't think too much about any slight price difference. It would be worth it to go with a professional moving company. [REVIEW_24] I didn't enjoy my experience at Clayton nails today 7/3/2015. It was all because of the nail tech; i didn't get her name but she was young; Vietnamese with a med length bob haircut. I went in for a gel color polish change. Her work is not as neat as what im use to there. She for some reason placed two scolding hot towels over each of my hands while removing the old color. I told her that the towels were too hot and she than removed them and swung them in the air to cool off than reapplied. She than asked 'is this better princess "".  Than she turned around and ask if that woke me up. I've had a gel polish color change several times before; no one has ever placed hot towels on my hands EVER;  i don't know why she did. After the gel color polish was applied and dry she repeatedly reapplied a top thick coat over and over. I kept having to place my hands under the uv light again; thats never happened before either. I guess i have to pick one person to go to and stick to them religiously. [REVIEW_25] The first time I ordered from this location; my order included a 2-liter of diet coke; but I received two 16-oz diet cokes instead. The second time I ordered from this location; my pizza came pushed to one side of the box as if it had slipped; or been dropped. I have NEVER experienced this much poor service from a Domino's before. I love Domino's; but no longer trust this location to deliver me a quality product. [REVIEW_26] Just got home from my LONG drive to Philadelphia PA. I had a house full of guests  and the general consensus for dinner was island cuisine. Unfortunately; I forgot that this is the Penn Relay weekend (huge mistake). After driving 1.5 hour and taking 30 minutes to find a $15 parking space; I finally arrived. The place was not too packed but half the patrons were gathered around the ordering counter. It took me a few minutes to realize that this increadibly roudy; vulgar bunch had aready placed their orders but were just hanging out at the counter; thus preventing newly arrived customers from placing their orders. I tried my best to get noticed and to get to the counter but had no luck. Ultimately; I and a few other customers (or should I say ""potential customers"" eventually gave up and left. The cincher for me was that the staff were clearly aware of what was occurring but made no attempt to control the crowd. I may have waited if the staff showed some business savvy and kept the counter area clear but unfortunately; they appeared overwhelmed and confused. i've eaten at the Jerk Hut several times (food is OK-good) but this visit left a bad taste in my mouth so I may have to reconsider future trips across the bridge for authentic JA CUISINE!! PS: Memo from prior visits; their wait staff can be a bit rude. [REVIEW_27] This restaurant smells like old; sour maple syrup. It's been ten hours and I can still smell it.  The food was terrible. I have no clue how this restaurant is in business. The eggs were mushy; slimy; and very watery. I took a few bites; but the flavor was so bad I couldn't eat anymore. I just can't understand how a restaurant that specializes in cooking eggs can be so bad at it. The potatoes were also gross; tasted like old dirty potatoes that were microwaved.  The coffee was really weak; too. It tasted like watered down tea.  I just can't stress enough how bad this restaurant is. Even the flower in the case on our table was dead. Stay away!!!!! I will say; the waiter and manager were very nice and friendly. [REVIEW_28] I compare this hotel to a pig wearing lipstick.  It is still a pig.  Nice beds; yup; updated bathrooms; yes; new carpet in room; yes. Nice staff; yes. So why 1 star?  It is a dump and whoever decided to put all this new stuff into rooms that smell like mold and mildew should be fired. I am staying here for a convention so someone else booked the rooms as I usually look at reviews before making a reservation. Heading that it was a Marriott and that is was an Opryland hotel; I thought; oh it will be nice. After walking into the room and getting the nasty smell hit me; I turned to the Marriott app to look st the reviews as well as on yelp.  Many other complaints posted. I asked my co-workers and 3 of the 4 people that I am traveling with also have the same smell.   Note to the management team: shame on you for booking these rooms without fixing the problem. [REVIEW_29] Never coming back. This is the second we've given then. Tonight; they charged us an extra $5; but was easily correct; not a huge deal. Second; the onion rings tasted like vanilla! We ordered a brownie cookie dough blast and got a cookie dough shake instead; the difference of about a dollar. My shake was missing the middle portion(see photo). The only good thing about this trip was the mozzarella sticks. 2 shakes and 2 sides for $15; no thanks. [REVIEW_30] I would give this place zero stars if I could. They advertise 2 paddle boards and all year only one paddle board and no paddle. Filthy conditions.  When u contact front desk they say management will call u but they don't. Units are not clean when students move in.  They allow animals. Configuration of the apartment is horrible. Like living in a cell block. Kitchen is too small. Not enough area for food prep or dish storage.   They put on a good show when students are checking the place out but it is bait and switch. Don't rent here",0
24,"[REVIEW_1] I went here after a recommendation that this is ""the best coffee place in philly"" and I'm so glad I checked it out! The cafe area itself is super nice & clean. They also offer tap and sparking water to customers which is awesome. Prices are very reasonable and the staff is super friendly. My friend and I chatted with one of the baristas for a few minutes and he gave us some pro-tips on how to make a killer espresso. I will definitely be coming back here again soon! [REVIEW_2] Holy crap; they really are freaky fast. They got all the additions and subtraction to my sandwiches right even though the guy didn't have a ticket for my order to go from. Super sweet and very helpful.  Ps. My sandwich was DELICIOUS [REVIEW_3] I first emailed through Yelp for a basic quote and received a quick response; and was also told about the discount from being a Yelp user. I called and asked if I needed to make an appointment but it was just recommended that I bring my car in early in the morning to ensure it's ready by the end of the day. The ladies up front are super communicative and up front about all charges before they went ahead with the work. They ordered new parts that arrived the same day. As a female in my 20s I'm always hesitant to visit new shops when I move to a city; but I felt confident in the work they did here. [REVIEW_4] Mac's is my favorite bar in Old City thus far. The place is nice without being too stuffy; has a great draft selection; and runs specials during games. They have a good social media presence; which I appreciate - it's the only place I've been able to find Oberon in Philly; and I discovered they carried it via Twitter. (Not going to lie; I was thinking 4 stars until I remembered their awesome rotating drafts.) The staff is great and although I've been in too late to personally want food; the food I've seen served looks and smells great. If you're looking for a great laid back bar in the area; this is it. [REVIEW_5] If I could give zero stars I would. I never ever have had such an experience at an establishment. I came here with a group of 8 for a birthday dinner. We had more than 1 server. I have no idea what any of their names were. They give NO REFILLS on anything (soda; tea; lemonade; etc) which I think is insane! So they recommend buying a pitcher. The pitchers and ice bucket were both in plastic containers you can get from the dollar store.   We wait nearly 2 hours for our food. Majority of our party ordered mac & cheese as a side. Once we got our plates we noticed their was shrimp in our mac & cheese. When we questioned our server; she responded ""Oh I thought she told you we ran out"". Mind you; that is completely fine; but what if someone had a seafood allergy?   To top it off; 2 of our party members (birthday girl included) did not receive their meals. They didn't even check back at the table until we flagged them down to report the missing plates. Our server then responded; ""I honestly don't even know what you ordered"". We didn't even finish our food and the birthday girl didn't even want to eat them to even bother making her food since we had waited so long and they were closing. We asked to speak to a manager and was told they would come. When they didn't; we asked again. At this time; our ""server"" (the same one we asked to get a manager) claimed she was the manager. WHICH WE KNEW WAS A LIE.   I understand they have just opened but theres no way an establishment should be run this way. Our entrees came out on glass plates; but everything else was on paper plates.   I WOULD NOT recommend this establishment to anyone. They didn't apologize or seem interested in good customer service. [REVIEW_6] Yats is the best Cajun Food that we have ever eaten and is quite economical to enjoy.  The menu is quite eclectic in that they cook each day what they want to cook and put it on a chalkboard.  You just never know what kind of tasty delight you will find on any one day.  This is a regular place to visit for my wife and I. [REVIEW_7] This is my favorite pizza in St. Louis.  It takes a while to come out - so I either call an hour ahead if I'm doing carry-out; or bring my quarters and play Pacman while I wait if I'm dining in.  The crust and sauce are phenomenal.  My favorite toppings to order are sausage; pepperoni; green pepper; and onion.  This is the pizza I get when I have friends come visit St. Louis from out of town.  In my opinion; it's better to dine in because of the divey atmosphere and you are making sure you eat the pizza right when it comes out of the oven (as opposed to maybe 20 minutes later by the time you pick it up and drive it home).  Such a great hole-in-the-wall dive with the best pizza in town. [REVIEW_8] OMG the Mediterranean chicken quesadillas what awesome sauce. Definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys fresh Greek food [REVIEW_9] Coffeebar is awesome.  The service is ALWAYS friendly; and my beverage is always tasty. [REVIEW_10] Easy glide into Tuesday evening. Cooler Buddies DIPA capped with the Shade Tree IPA. Fold in a perfect playlist and you're good to go. Love this place! [REVIEW_11] Top 10 worst restaurant experiences of all time!  Stopped in for lunch this Sunday afternoon. I had seen the reviews about bad service here but was driving and figured WTH; let me give it a try. I am sorry i did.   I walk in and the toothpick chewing attendant is sitting on a stool. Sees me but continues to play with his phone. After an awkward 2 min staring contest motions me to 'sit where ever' wave. Brings over a cracked plastic glass with his palm covering and touching the rim of my glass and warm pitcher of water. Ordered boneless Chicken Korma was brought out by a waiter in a small cereal bowl with another small cereal bowl of microwaved rice in which we had his thumb. I wanted to walk out but honestly felt sorry for the guy given the restaurant only had one other party of three dinning on a Sunday Afternoon. Food was horriable. Instead of Chicken Korma i was given what tasted like Chicken Makhni curry over spiced and over salted to look like Chicken Korma. Waiter disappears and emerged with three fingers on a plate plopped it down and disappeared forever. I ate about a quarter of the meal and literally felt like throwing up. The meat was a mixture of white and dark meat left over from thigh or other parts (was odd shaped and some was shredded). Rice quality was good but it was tortured dry in a microwave before it was served. Asked for check. Paid and then told the attendant that i was sorry but meal was not that good. His reply ""Okay...thanks....""   For what i got and what i paid ($13) it was not only a rip off but an insult. Not once did ANYONE come over to ask if everything was ok. Rocky tables were stabilized with folded paper napkins; napkin holders on all tables are MIA. Napkins are just piled on a table with salt shakers to hold them down. How much are plastic glass and napkin holders at Ikea or Restaurant Depot? ts obvious these people don't give a crap about customers and dont have a clue about service. When they do close their doors; they will have no one to blame but themselves! [REVIEW_12] Appointment for an oil change was easy to make; I was greeted promptly upon arrival; they got my vehicle right in (as they should since I had an appointment); and I was out of there in 1 hour.  I bought my vehicle here; and they have been nothing but great every time I needed service. Excellent dealership! Considering the 5 year warranty and excellent service; I will continue buying Kia Sorrentos. [REVIEW_13] Dined at the restaurant for the first time tonight.  The food was excellent.  The kitchen is most accommodating.  I ordered the roasted pear salad which was listed on the menu as being served with gorgonzola cheese and a red wine vinegrette.  I asked if they could substitute goat cheese and the apricot vinaigrette which was served on another salad - NO PROBLEM;  Osso Bucco is my favorite veal dish and Trattoria Totaro's is one of the best I have ever had. It was served with risotto and broccoli rate - both excellent. My friend loved her Veal Vivian.  Portions are very generous and the food is served piping hot and plated well. The lemon cake we shared for dessert was delicious - very light and refreshing.  Our server Donna could not have been nicer.  Will certainly return very soon. [REVIEW_14] Terrible establishment.  Poor service. The bouncers do not have any restraint. If you are female they will grab you aggressivley. ..very hostile. I have had a few terrible experiences there and I share them with everyone I meet so they know what they are getting into when they go there. Don't waste your time or your money when Nashville has so many other awesome places to offer! [REVIEW_15] I ordered the chicken stew; it was Tasteless chicken; it was a fried chicken possibly a leftover; that was thrown into a pot and made it into a stew.  If I wanted leftovers; I would have eaten at home.  Gross; still feel like I have to throw up. [REVIEW_16] Sassafras Restaurant has a nicely-decorated exterior (strip mall) and a very attractive; clean; neat; and welcoming interior. The waiter was very friendly and helpful. We ordered Seafood Platters; which came with catfish; oysters; shrimp; fries; and a delicious house salad; as an appetizer. The salad dressings were home made; and the fried seafood items were well seasoned and not the least bit greasy. Also; the portions were generous. We were all very pleased and remarked that we would certainly return. RJT [REVIEW_17] I've been going here now for a couple of months. I have never received more compliments on my nails then I have since seeing Nary!   I love all the girls that work there; and we all banter amongst each other; and the other clients as well. No more sitting in silence while I get my nails done!! Yay!  I recommend making an appointment! This is not a dime a dozen nail salon! They offer the newest designs and jewels that so many others don't; and because of that; it's busy. You can walk in; but prepare to sit and wait. And if you want crazy encrusted nails; you can get them here! But you'll pay for what you want; so if you're on a budget throw out your number from the beginning so you aren't shocked at check out.   See you ladies in 2 weeks!! [REVIEW_18] After a last minute cancellation of dog walking services for our vacation; we luckily found Zen Pet Care Services!  Chris and Elisha were extremely responsive and accommodating.  They were able to come out to meet our dogs within just a few days and we could not have been more thankful!  We'll definitely be contacting them for our future needs! [REVIEW_19] The local vibe; fresh shucked oysters at the bar; friendly service; and delicious seafood; (fresh local); make this place worth checking out. [REVIEW_20] Always a quick response! Very polite and knowledgeable. Great value. Chris seems to be ""our"" heating and cooling guy; he's the one that always comes to our house. We do schedule maintenance spring and fall. Three (?) years ago after our check; (one of the VERY hot summers) our upstairs AC had problems; they checked it; had leak and was low on freon. It was ""fixed"" to work for that day/night. A new one was put in the next day; if not; the next. They don't try to push anything or sell you more than you need. [REVIEW_21] The worst mechanics in Reno.  I brought a VW jetta here for an alignment and the steering wheel was 1/4 off to the left when they gave it back.  I took it to another alignment shop the next day and they asked if these guys were retarted. as the toe; camber and caster were all very off from where they should be.  STEER CLEAR OF THIS PLACE. [REVIEW_22] The gelato may be very good; but I can't remember after such a negative dining experience.  With the exception of one person (the owner?) the staff were pretty missable.  Not a single smile to be had.  I don't expect my behind kissed; or even small talk; but I don't expect to give business to an establishment that hires people who seem bothered to be there.  There are three tables inside with ample room for a few more---not very family friendly.  Me; hubs and three children under 3 waited patiently for a table.  The icing on the cake was other customers---a lady practically climbed over my daughter to grab my hubs' seat when he got up to use the bathroom.  Seriously.  Not the establishment's fault; but all around poor attitude and rudeness abounded.  We won't be returning.  If you have children; pass on this place and enjoy ice cream at home. [REVIEW_23] My family needed some documents notorized . Maureen was extremely pleasant and professional. They have great hours for all types of schedules. I will recommend to all my friends and family!!! Allstar service!!! [REVIEW_24] I have gone here now a few times and have been overall very happy with my hair cuts... I have a very short pixie cut that was started by my usual hair dresser. Unfortunately she moved to a different state and it has been so difficult finding another stylist like her. I have gone to so many different salons and have paid more money than I normally would just to find someone who can cut my hair the way I want it. Well I happened to stop here one day just because I needed my hair cut and had no other ideas. It turned out great!! I was so happy to finally have my hair cut correctly! Melanie and Shelly have both done my hair and I'm very happy with how both of them have done my hair. I haven't tried anyone else at this salon but it seems like everyone is very happy with their hair cuts. The price is great and the stylists are friendly :) [REVIEW_25] Love dining here.  From the restaurant and the unique meat options to the tri tip barbecue I am always pleased.  The service and staff are wonderful! [REVIEW_26] This is an East Nashville mainstay.  They have an authentic Boston-style fish & chips that is excellent.  Also poor a great Guinness! [REVIEW_27] So happy my trainer turned me on to this place.   I walked in feeling terrible about myself and left feeling motivated and excited.  The products are amazing and Anna is extremely knowledgable.   Everyone there is friendly and motivating... [REVIEW_28] Waited 3 hours between buying the tickets and enter to the haunted asylum; it was not scary at all and it just lasts 13 minutes. Not worth it.  While waiting in line; someone started to throw balls and it hit a few people. [REVIEW_29] This is so perfect for Manayunk; especially for those of us on the go to be able to grab a quick healthy snack. It's always clean and the staff is always friendly. Sometimes the flavors aren't my favorite; but I love being creative so I find a way to make it work for what my mood is that day!!! Love this place!!! [REVIEW_30] Absolutely delicious for lunch and dinner. Charming atmosphere and great service. Food is fresh and flavorful.",23
25,"[REVIEW_1] Ordered here tonight and now regretting it as I sit here with chills fever vomiting and upset stomach! NEVER AGAIN!!!  I ate the clear soup; crunchy rolls and teriyaki chicken :((( never ever again [REVIEW_2] So basically; you are going to be having a student cut your hair...  There is a ""teacher"" watching; but I don't think they are any better since the ""teacher"" messed up my cut more than the student did.  The haircuts are cheap; so if you are looking for something really affordable and want to take your chances; then go for it.  It will really all depend on how good of a student you have and how ready they are at that time to be a real stylist/barber.  My cut just so happened to turn out horribly; but I prepared myself for that since I knew what I was getting myself into.  Just prepare yourself for the same if you decide to take a chance to get a cut here.  DO NOT do it if you definitely need to get a good cut for an event or something because it can potentially turn out to be tragic! [REVIEW_3] Unexpected surprised by the coolness of the coffee shop.  Didn't think much of the place at first but then  I noticed  it's tied in to a outdoor store; which immediately made it awesome.    Look for little detail in the style of the place (such as carbiners and cam lobes in the cement). Coffee was very good too.  Sweet offerings of speciality drinks. (Pumpkin something during my visit)   Fun A+ coffee shop for the non-pompous type [REVIEW_4] I went to the drive thru hopefully I can get served so was at the speaker for half hour and lady had a attitude cause we asked if we could get service to say they had to change till and several cars left in the process I had to go home hungry that was totally sad luckily I not a diabetic [REVIEW_5] I love this place the owner dirty is great... So is his amazing staff Tone is my favorite!!!! [REVIEW_6] I've always heard great things about their groothie so I tried it. It was giving me a smoothie-gasm. Love it. But then one time it was served room-temperature and it was awkward...which was off putting to me because I don't really like warm smoothies; though other people may not mind. Personally; I think I pay good money for this; so it bothered me. I came back another day for another try; and I realized I fell in love with the groothie when it's chilled. I've yet to try their other goods! I like the vibe of the place itself though. Lots of positivity :) [REVIEW_7] Conveniently located but they jack the price up unfairly when they feel like it. Watch them when they ring you up when you buy alcohol. [REVIEW_8] I just read through all of these reviews and giggled over everyone's unique opinion on what exactly the Goleta K-Mart smells like. My own instincts whisper to me ""cat pee."" And yes! a little sulphur (read that in someone else's review; thanks!) Having lived with cats all my life; it smells like home. This isn't a good thing.  It's almost impressive how bad the check-out is. You can find the shortest line; where there is one or no people in front of you; and it will STILL take you like 20 minutes to get through the line. The last time I went; my nail polish rang up as $82 for some weird fucking reason (probably because their computer system is from like 1983) and then the girl had to do the whole thing over again. The penultimate time I was here; I managed to get in a very short line only to have the lady in front of me decide to sign up for a Sears credit card (REALLY WHO DOES THIS SHIT) at the check-out. Which took an impressively long amount of time. Will I still come here to buy my hair dye? Sadly; yes; because it's like half the price of the grocery store. And lord help me if my natural hair color starts growing in.  Also; I seriously almost run someone over every time I try to park. Not in anger; but just because it seems like the elderly like to hide behind cars and then jump into my view at the last second. It's almost like a conspiracy. hmmm....  well; here's hoping someone finally finds the courage to blow the motherfucker up one day. [REVIEW_9] I can't say enough nice things about this place! When we first got there I was so tired and hungry and put out by the lack of parking but by the time we left I had completely forgotten!     The waitstaff is top notch! We decided to try and have a seat at the bar area while we waited for a table to open up. While we were standing there; a man (who I believe is the owner) offered to let us sit there! We received excellent service (and conversation!) from there on out.      My boyfriend and I started out with mimosas and Bloody Mary to start out with. Their Bloody Mary is made to your liking with sake instead of vodka; which gives it a wonderful flavor! The spice level was perfect. I later tried a pineapple mimosa and ordered an apple cider mimosa. Both were delicious. I ordered the meat lover's omelet; and it was great; but my boyfriend ordered the steak and eggs. The steak was one of the best steaks I've ever eaten!!!! The sauce that came with it was out of this world. I also had the bananas foster pancakes; which tasted just like they came from one of my favorite New Orleans brunch spots.      On a personal note; I work a lot. I'm away from home a lot too so the time I get to spend with my loved ones is sacred. I will always remember this brunch because everything about it was percent- our table; the waiters; the owner's attention to us-it all came together to create a lovely experience. We will definitely be returning!!! [REVIEW_10] The service SUCKS!!!!  The food is mediocre; at best;  and definitely not worth a second trip. We ordered flat bread to start 30 min before we ordered apps and entrees. The flatbreads arrived at the same time the apps did. [REVIEW_11] Wonderful new fusion restaurant in town. I came here because of all the Instagram posts and the high ratings on Yelp. I was expecting a great meal; and I was not disappointed. The menu is concise and everything sounds tasty.   The sticky chicken wings are a must! The sauce on them is super addicting. I wish I could buy a bottle of it. The kimchi burger is a great twist on an American favorite. I can't wait to return to try their chicken and waffles. Also if you saved any room for dessert make sure to try their pandan waffles with green tea ice cream (off menu item). I was stuffed and didn't think I could take another bite; but as soon as I tasted their dessert I didn't stop till it was all gone. [REVIEW_12] First; I want to clarify that the service was great! Unfortunately the food sucked so hard that they only came out with the rare one-star rating.  I was really; really disappointed in the quality of food! It was basically inedible...the best thing was my daughter's French toast (which was still just average). My meal was hash browns covered in peppers & onions; salsa and cheese. The peppers & onions weren't fully cooked; the hash browns were like mush and it was smothered in plain old pace salsa from a jar. Sick. And so; so disappointing. Also incredibly over priced at $10 for a breakfast meal. We had 2 adult and 1 child meals; and used a free meal coupon and the bill still managed to be over $20?! When we go to Cracker Barrel around the corner the tab is $22 (no coupons or discounts) and we get way more food of much higher quality. Breakfasts will be at Cracker Barrel from now on! [REVIEW_13] I found this center to be very honest; ethical; and competent.  Had a transmission problem with my BMW 2003 over the holidays. BMW Dealership wanted to replace it and charge me a fortune. Cottman was able to fix the transmission and save me the cost of getting a new one.  Highly recommended. [REVIEW_14] Paid for the $25 wash and detail (the most deluxe package they offer); added leather cleaning for $20. My dog had been in the car while muddy so there was dried dirt on the backseat; which I mentioned. I knew when they called me after only 15 min that it wasn't cleaned well. When I saw it it was obviously that they hadn't cleaned the leather at all. When I said that to the guy he sprayed a towel and literally wiped down the back seat for less than a minute. Didn't clean any other leather on the headrests; doors; console-anywhere. The wipe down on the cup holders; steering column; etc was just as bad. The vacuuming was terrible; didn't get under the mats or the way back. They didn't clean the rims at all even the the package included rim detail and shine. I basically paid $45 for a drive through car wash. [REVIEW_15] When I lived in Florida; This was my go to place for relaxing. My best friend and I would always get a full set pedi; relax in the massive massage chairs; have a glass of wine that you had the choice of and just melt into the hot water; on our feet. It was a quiet calm atmosphere. great skills they used; clean tools; professional job overall in their work and we kept coming back because of that. I miss this place for a relaxing break to take. Next time I'm in Tampa; I'll be hitting this place up again. [REVIEW_16] Worst chicken tenders ever!! they take 15-20mins to make them and once they are finally at your table.....they are harder than a rock. Terrible. [REVIEW_17] This tiny Mediterranean spot on the corner of 10th and Spruce may not look like too much from the outside; but once you step inside; the experience is sure to blow you away. I've been here twice but both were absolutely incredible dining experiences. Both times I visited were during brunch hours so my reviews will be based on that menu.   My first bit of advice is; if you haven't been before and want to know what to order; the answer is the Cyprus Breakfast. This meal; and it is quite filling; has everything you could want for a brunch. Two extra crispy fried eggs; a big slab of ham; two pieces of a fried Mediterranean cheese; some delicious bread and a salad; all together on one glorious plate. My fiancé and I both ordered each time we went because it is that good!  This past trip; I also ordered the lamb sandwich; which was also amazing. Large chunks of lamb and lots of fresh herbs on a soft roll.  Another menu item I'm dying to try is the rabbit soup that was on special. The way it looked on the table next to me had me wishing there was room left in my stomach. For dessert the answer is the galaktoboureko. I know this is a complicated word but if you just the gala they'll know what you mean. It's a warm rich custard with a layer of crispy phyllo dough on the top and bottom; drizzled in orange infused syrup. It's outstanding.   Kanella is special because of more than just the food. They have an amazing staff. We had the same young waiter both times we went. He was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Usually you don't remember the waiter and if you do; it's never for good reasons. The service here actually enhances the experience. On top of that; there was a family with an elderly man in a wheel chair coming to dine here while we were eating. I saw the chef (who I believe is also the owner) leave the kitchen; go outside and help the man in through a back entrance and actually wheel him all the way up to his seat at the table. Honestly; this was really touching to see.   I couldn't recommend Kanella more highly. I will be back again soon! [REVIEW_18] As good as it gets for a food truck! Food Court chinese (which I'm sure you know exactly what I mean by that) is one of those lunches I just shamelessly crave. I have to say this beats all cheap Chinese in center city flavor wise. Not to mention it's actually cheaper then all other options for ""food court Chinese"". Shrimp and broccoli; egg roll; lo mein and a soda all for $6? I'm in. Once a week. Lines are usually long but they move relatively fast so don't be deterred. They have a spicy option you can add if you're into that. Huge portions and super friendly. Enjoy frugal friends! [REVIEW_19] A high class sushi bar; hot pot station; and if you'd like to cook your own thinly sliced ribs; the Japanese cuisine is here. I was craving buckwheat noodle and knew it was served here. A little expensive but worth every penny. [REVIEW_20] Its unfortunate that this restaurant has to hire such terrible people... The delivery driver was one of the rudest people I have ever encountered. My girlfriend placed the order but was indisposed at the time of the initial delivery call that happened at 4:25 pm and I answered the subsequent call 5 minutes later to be harassed and yelled at by the delivery driver for not answering the call. I apologized but he continued to yell at me on the phone. When I went down to pick up my food he continued to harass me outside of my apartment and yell at me after he gave me the food. I wish we hadn't already tipped him on grubhub or else he would have received zero dollars. [REVIEW_21] Red Hook is my jam!  This place focuses on their drinks and their extensive food options. I appreciate this a lot. They aren't pretentious; at all; and have a chill funky homey vibe about then. The people there are pretty friendly and welcoming. I had solid drinks from Red Hook. But if you are looking for a coffee shop that can serve good drinks and good food; then Red Hook blows away the competition.  I've been to cafes that serve good drinks; but not good food. This place serves both! [REVIEW_22] I hear good and bad about this venue; but the fact is that I love that we have a real concert house in town that affords us the ability to see a level of entertainment that normally wouldn't be stopping in Reno. I don't know as much about sound as some of the others around here; but when I go to a show I like to hear and feel it; and I always get both at the Knit. From the first show I saw there (The Roots); and the last one I made it to (Awolnation); I am always satisfied when I leave. [REVIEW_23] This place doesn't want your business!! Try to call in a take-out order and they'll ignore the phone; direct you to their app (they've actually refused to take my order over the phone) or require a credit card to place an order. Going there is no picnic either. Your clothes will smell like you worked the kitchen. Bring headphones if you do go because there's no music and the noise is deafening. Constant noise from the fry cutting machine and sirens going off when fries are done. The burgers taste OK but the fries are greasy and undercooked. Expect diarrhea. I tried to give zero stars but Yelp doesn't allow that! [REVIEW_24] Don't do business with this ""company"".  They don't respond to emails or phone calls. In fact; they don't even have a voicemail set up so it just rings to no avail. I ordered a product along with 2 day shipping.  I waited the 2-3 days processing time and emailed to inquire for tracking number. Nothing. Called over and over. For an establishment that sets such strict guidelines on no refunds; high restocking fees and also threatens they will seek monetary damages if you file a pay pal claim; you would think they would follow their own rules.  As soon as I filed a claim with PayPal they responded and refunded my money. How difficult is it to communicate with your customer?  It's a fraudulent business in my opinion and PayPal should discontinue doing business with them. [REVIEW_25] The tux worked out great. It looked sharp and service was nice & fast.  It's not often I need a tux but when I do I will definitely be back. [REVIEW_26] This was one of the greatest meals I have ever had.  The food was delicious and the hospitality was second to none.  The lamb was cooked to perfection; the rice had the perfect amount of spice.  The ability to easily describe the amount of spice made this meal perfect for spicy lovers; but also easy for those with a milder pallet.  All of this is from someone who has historically not been a fan of Pakistani/Indian food.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and would encourage a trip to St. Louis just for the food here. [REVIEW_27] Hello again yelpers! I just have to delete my last review on Peppermill. We had the chance to give them another try thanks to David Fuller. He graciously offered us the chance to return to change our thoughts. It worked! We got there and Maddie at the front desk was amazing. We were early so we asked if we could check in and she got right on it. Our rooms were clean 2 hours before check in time. She had a great smile and her hospitality was impeccable. Our room was amazing with gorgeous views and unmatched comfort. The spa is wonderful as well; don't skip it when you go! This was also a very busy weekend and they did not falter. Thank you Peppermill and staff for changing my mind. I will surely return and tell my friends and patrons that Peppermill is worth it. One more thumbs up for Maddie thank you so much. Oh she was awesome. [REVIEW_28] Outstanding service; food and drinks.  The Mojitos; Cava Martinis and Espresso Martini are unbelievable.   The food is beautifully prepared and delicious!  The prices are so reasonable and the staff will do anything to make your experience perfect. The food is definitely a blend of Spanish; Mexican and other Latin American cuisines. On our trip to Mussel Shoals we made the drive to Cava twice.   Bravísimo! [REVIEW_29] They treated me very badly here. I was a regular customer that developed a relationship with one of the nail techs. She did excellent work that always stood the test of time. One evening I was running 15 minutes late and I texted the woman that did my nails. Apparently; one of the employees was looking at the wrong day and booked my nail tech at the same time. When I arrived; she thought the incident occurred because I was late for my appointment and because I contacted the nail tech directly rather than the business itself. She didn't realize she had been looking at the wrong day. She proceeded to yell at me and tell me it was all my fault in front of the entire salon. I apologized for not calling the business directly and she never acknowledged her error on scheduling on the wrong day.  During another incident; my nail tech was going to come in on her day off to accommodate a special event that I had. When I called the salon to let them know due to the above incident; they talked to me in a horrible manner and that day I told my favorite nail tech (after searching for years) I couldn't visit her salon anymore. 3 months later; we finally reunited and she has since left that salon. [REVIEW_30] Last night we are out with friends and though we would try a new Resturant. What a mistake; starting right from service walking in; people were confused and didn't know even where to seat us. We had a reservation.  The server was fine; the meals were not to any of our liking; service was far below average. I think since they already have a Resturant in Philadelphia; they can do anything they want.  We would never return and were will pass this on to many in South Jersey.",16
26,"[REVIEW_1] Just went here for breakfast.  The food was just OK; the service wasn't particularly great; in fact our server seemed fairly put out anytime we asked for anything.  What really made this a one star experience;  though; was the 6 or 7 year old boy (who was not a customer; possibly our server's son) who was hammering away on the piano the whole time we were there.   We asked our server to ask him to take a break and she was not thrilled but said ok.  She said something to him and he stopped... for about 30 seconds.  Then right back to hammering on the piano keys.   Who wants to pay for breakfast and have to listen to someone hammer away arbitrarily on a piano??? Will never go back. [REVIEW_2] This place is so scummy. Do not go here. I had an entire purse stolen with car keys; iphones; passport inside and no one working was willing to even look if it was turned in; behind the bar or help me out. They told me ""it happens all the time"". Unfriendly and untrustworthy. Do not waste your time. [REVIEW_3] Just left there...horrible service and miserable employees.  WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN. Miss Baja fresh. [REVIEW_4] Airport pickup never showed up after an hour and multiple calls. Hotel stopped answering the phone.  Very poorly managed. [REVIEW_5] Yikes; I just got that hard nasty piece of chicken that usually ruins Chinese restaurants for you. Bad; very bad. The worst. The steak and shake next door was so busy they had to close; and I should have known since no one was in line at Wendy's. most disgusting fast food I've ever experienced; crazy that this was the absolute worst. Garbage food. [REVIEW_6] i didnt want to give up a star but... the place sucks! [REVIEW_7] Smoking allowed. There; I said it.  Good equipment; lots of room for players; and a nice area for spectators.  But they allow smoking.  EDIT: Lowering to 1 star after ""Peter F."" posted his ridiculous claim that spending $22;000 on an air filter makes any difference in protecting his customers from deadly carcinogens...he should do his homework: https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/air-purifier-smoke/faq-20058555 [REVIEW_8] Went to this car wash. My car looked just as dirty coming out  as it did going in. I informed the owner and she said that the car wash will not get all the dirt off and that's why they give you a towel. I thought the purpose of a car wash was to clean my car. I could see if it was filthy dirty with caked on mud or something. There was just dust on my car. It should've been cleaned. [REVIEW_9] After my last visit I said I wouldn't go back here again; but sadly I found myself needing a doctor over Memorial Day weekend and didn't want to go to an ER.   I sat in the waiting room for 20 minutes before leaving without being seen. It seems that even though they were open; the doctor decided not to show up. I did a Google search and found a different clinic that took my insurance. I had to drive half an hour but I was seen by a doctor.  I will never go to Advanced Urgent Care again. I'd rather drive a half hour and know I'll have good service than drive five minutes for nothing. [REVIEW_10] A few years ago when the cupcake store boom hit the valley; my Mom and I went on a cupcake tour and tried many different businesses out. Sugar Rush was one of our first stops on our quest for quality cupcakes; and we were not disappointed. The service is very friendly and you can tell they take pride in their flavors and presentation. Fast forward to now: There were a few birthdays coming up in my family and after spending lots of money on Christmas gifts; I wanted to keep it simple and affordable. Sugar Rush is very close to my house; so I thought; why not get everyone some beautiful gourmet cupcakes and a nice card? Boom~ easy; awesome gift! I went in and was greeted by a nice woman who was happy to answer any questions I had. After browsing all of the flavors (There are a lot! Something for everybody!) I ended up buying all of their margarita cupcakes; because that flavor was my favorite out of all the ones I tried a few years ago. I love that they have containers for just 1 or 2 cupcakes; perfect for gifts. My family members loved their cupcakes upon seeing them and said they were delicious! Of course; I had to get one for myself....It was just as yummy as I remember. I will definitely be back for more! [REVIEW_11] You get what you see--chicken fingers. They also serve wings and other overpriced items like mac and cheese (mediocre) and pastries (meh).   The sauces are unique and probably the best part about this place as you won't be able to find sauces like this elsewhere. Be watchful of how full the sauce is because some of the containers are not completely full and you get jipped. Sadly you can't sample the sauces without having to buy them. My favorite is bar b q sauce. It has a slight acidic vinegar kick; but isn't bittersweet. Maybe they cut back on the sugar? The chipotle lime mayo is great. It isn't too creamy and oily. The chipotle is subtle; almost dull and a little bit more would make it better and bold. I found myself having to double dunk the chicken in this sauce to really taste it. You always finish it wishing you had a little more. I've tried almost all of them and none of them are too memorable that I can recall anything great or bad about the rest of the sauces.  The breading is thin and crisp; which I appreciate. With one bite you taste the breading and chicken; and not just breading on heavily breaded chicken that other places might serve. The breading can be over salty and seasoned too much. Don't mistake this for rich and intense. It is salty. I end up drinking a lot of water with this meal partially due to this. What makes the breading suck is that it is not always fresh. Who knows how long the chicken has been sitting out.  The meat can be hit or miss; the chicken can be a little parched. This is disappointing when you have a whole pound of chicken to consume that will leave your mouth dry and leave you bloated after you drink a lot to quench your thirst and high sodium intake. More often then not; I always get the dried; salty chicken instead of the juicy; tender chicken that I once got at my very first visit. Perhaps I am unlucky and get the left over stale pieces that have been sitting out long. I can only recall once when my chicken was tender and juicy when they first opened.I try to avoid wasting money here because I have not had the same type of meal since my first. However; out of desperation to try something different than the usual univ city food; I have eaten here a few times to make this review justified.  What my friends and I would like to do is split up and someone get french fries from Greek Lady and the others get chicken from Wishbone. We would satisfy our elementary palates by eating chicken fingers and french fries. If you are willing to walk a few more blocks; Allegros has really good curly fries but portions are a lot bigger when you eat at the place.  I would have given this place 1.5 stars for the food; but they once cancelled a chicken wing eating contest on my friends and me just hours prior to the event with poor explanation so I knock it down to 0.5 stars; but yelp doesn't have 0.5 increments. [REVIEW_12] Dirty rooms & headboard trash under the bed. alarm clock and radio doesn't work. unknown substance on curtains in the room appears to be someone's DNA. absolutely no benefit to the concierge level not allowed access to the club or library. Hallways and elevator  look like they haven't been cleaned since it was the PSFS building. incompetent Front house staff that are unhelpful unwilling and unknowledgeable to accommodate adequate service [REVIEW_13] I went In For a diagnostic. Told the issue (that is unrelated to this post)....afterwards my car would not start. So the mechanic put my car in neutral ....not drive....and then it started. It did not do that to begin with.....so when I got home it would not park!!!! And I didn't go for that problem at all!!!!! [REVIEW_14] I had been stalking food trucks for some time; when I finally landed somewhere that had five all together. Most were selling sample size items for a small prize. At WCTT; you got three tacos for the same prize. Loved; loved; loved them! Served on corn tortillas with meat perfectly cooked; you couldn't ask for more! And friendly service; to boot. If you see this truck in your area; high tail it over there! [REVIEW_15] Came for all-you-can-eat; and ended up waiting for over half an hour to get our order in. The servers completely ignored us; while taking orders from the tables around us. And on top of that; all of the rolls contain ""extras"" not listed on the menu. One roll surprised us by having sweet mustard sauce on it; which did NOT taste very good.... On the bright side; once we actually got our orders in they didn't take all that long to make them. [REVIEW_16] Food is great. Got food poisoning. Sooooo not going Back there ever. Check out koizi in Tampa [REVIEW_17] This is the worst Chik-fil-A I have ever been to. On multiple occasions I have waited over 25 minutes to get my food. Their response is ""Sorry; we got backed up."" It seems they are backed up on every occasion. They even have the sandwiches pre-made waiting to go in the bags but somehow; among all 10 employees behind the counter; they are so backed up that a five minute wait turns to a 25 plus minute wait. Avoid at all cost. Much better options at the Union! [REVIEW_18] Called in to pick up my order but when I arrived they acted as though they never spoke to me. I was told I'd have to wait an extra 10 minutes on top of the 15 minutes of previous waiting. The food was undercooked and the service staff was incredibly rude. I'll never return to this place. [REVIEW_19] Ridiculous prices for small portions/little meat/mostly rice. [REVIEW_20] After numerous visits here; we really wanted to like this place but each time there has been a number of issues; many repeating. No matter the time of day; it seems to get pretty rowdy and my friends and I have had drinks spilled on us on multiple occasions. Almost every time I have been here with my fiancé or friends; it has taken an abnormally long time to get service whether it be inside; outside at a table or bar. The food is mediocre for the price and a few times the food took MUCH longer to come out than what we were told; and when asking management what was going on; we were told that the estimate was wrong and it was ""too bad"". Staff is rude and far from attentive; though it seems like this place is always over-staffed when we have been here. Amazes me that management allows such a huge lack in customer service. No longer wasting our time and money here; and we advise our friends and family to do the same. It is too much of a hit-and-miss to come here and attempt to have a good time. [REVIEW_21] Paid for Deluxe Services almost 2 months prior to the event and only received a basic package at best. Attempts to resolve the issue with Keith have been returned with defensive dialogue; accusatory statements and untruths. His unprofessional approach has escalated this situation to the point of being settled in court. I have never been treated so poorly by a vendor. [REVIEW_22] This is a great place to stop and get breakfast.   Our experience at the Yolk was fantastic.  It was a little busy when we arrived.  We had a group of four and we were seated at the counter.  Our waitress (Ivana) was over to introduce herself and take our drink order.  Once our drinks came she took our food order.   Sitting at the counter we got to watch all the other plates go out to other tables.  Which there were so many that looked delicious.  Our food came out and it was cooked perfectly.  Over all Ivana was amazing and the food was great.  Ask for Ivana to take care of you. [REVIEW_23] My fault for falling for the $6.99/lb filet (or maybe another cut; it was a month ago and I can't remember that specifically) and buying 2 (one for me; one for fiance).  Shame on me for not cooking it on the day I bought it; apparently.  Because when I DID go to cook it the next day (yes; that's right) it had turned brown and smelled awful.  Note that the other items in my fridge were fine (including other raw meat); so I suspect this was on its last legs when I purchased it.  Did I worry about being able to return it?  No...I go in there all the time (laziness and convenience) and in fact had been there 4 times that weekend because I was baking something and kept forgetting key ingredients.   So I went in; without my receipt; to ask if I could exchange it for a fresher piece of meat (I really had my heart set on steak).  Tito; the manager; gave me a super hard time about not having the receipt...I explained that I'm not used to having to keep the receipt in case the food I bought was SPOILED; but he didn't care.  He then proceeded to tell me that maybe it was my fridge; that I really needed to receipt; and to generally balk at my attempt to politely receive a refund or new steak.  Finally; he gave in and I got 2 new steaks; but that wasn't the end.  He stopped me to inspect them on my way out and started saying again how he thought I had either left them in my fridge; or my fridge was broken.  I commented that if I had the same issue at DiBruno Brothers; I wouldn't be put through this grief; to which he responded; ""Well; we aren't DiBruno Brothers"".  No shit.  I emailed them and commented and of course heard no response.  I really wish that the little grocery at 20th and Spruce was better stocked; because I this place blows and I don't enjoy going there.  GAH! [REVIEW_24] That's the last time I go there. I went to mail a package; and when I went to pay the $5. 55 cent charge; he said ""Oh; you want to use that debit card? That will cost you an extra $1.00.  So now they are penalizing you for using debit? From now on; I will drive my butt back to the post office and mail my stuff like I used to. [REVIEW_25] Went to this Taco Bell last night.  It was 1 30 and it said 30 minutes to close.  All the lights were on.  We backed up and forward twice and no one would wait on us.  We gave up and pulled up young man was at window closing  register.  Taco Bell was happy to serve us. [REVIEW_26] Store is severely understaffed Waiting in line to check out can take up to 25 minutes  Avoid this store if possible  The workers are nice; but they know they are understaffed to make the profits look better as a strategy [REVIEW_27] Nigel's an awesome guy and the candy is amazing it's worth the drive!  Can't believe how much all my friend love and sadly eat all my Bon bons he sells. [REVIEW_28] $28 for two cheesesteaks and a large gravy fries? Cheesesteaks nothing to write home about either.  If your paying that much the steaks should have been the best. Go to Pete's or Lenny's in the neighborhood; you'll pay less but get more. Once this fad dies down the windows will be boarded up; and this place will be another fly by night outfit. [REVIEW_29] I have been to a couple of Keke's in other cities; however; was exceedingly disappointed with my experience today. After an hour of waiting we were told our order was misplaced and it would be out shortly. I understand these things happen; yet the employees and manager made no attempts to make our experience better. The manager acknowledged once the food was delivered that the portions were small and inaccurate. However; icing on the cake was the waitress dropping off the check as we finally got our first bite. Not to check on us even during the rest our meal. If someone had made a single attempt to make our experience better I would not be writing this review; but today I paid for extremely poor service and I do not plan to return. [REVIEW_30] This place is so good just thinking about it makes me want to splooj. Seriously I can't imagine a place that satisfies all my needs like this place. The manager justin always greets me with a warm smile and a hearty beard. Why would you go anywhere else to entertain a guest or yourself? I don't know. One time I pronounced Chardonnay with a hard ""ch"" and no one even blinked an eye; so don't be shy order what you want!",5
27,"[REVIEW_1] Just another delightful stop during my New Orleans visit. Loved the look of it when we first walked in as it resembles an old fashioned ice cream parlor; Next the plethora of unique flavors. The hardest part was deciding on which flavors to choose. The mini scoop samplers are the way to go; that way you can try a variety. I got a sampler and I cannot say there was one flavor I did not like. This place is a must stop. Oh; and the staff was super friendly too; even with a line out the door. Cash only [REVIEW_2] I am an Italian southern girl who grew up on Italian creole food; thus; finding great Spanish food has been hard for me.  This restaurant has the best authentic Mexican/Spanish food in the greater New Orleans area.  The food is cooked fresh in an open kitchen that smells so good it will have your stomach growling.  The menu used to be written in Spanish however; they switched to pictures and an English menu which has only allowed me to explore Spanish cuisine further.  My husband and I are addicted to the horchata drinks.  He loves the fajitas; I love their enchiladas.  I chose a red sauce over my enchiladas instead of green which the hostess explained the green sauce was hotter but I found the red sauce to be spicy to perfection.   We placed our order to go because we love to eat at home; however they have a huge dining area and flat screen t.v. with soccer playing last time we went.  If your looking for real; authentic Mexican/Spanish cuisine then I recommend this restaurant. [REVIEW_3] I cannot believe I haven't written a review for my favorite restaurant in Louisiana! Seriously; if I was on death row; the BBQ Shrimp would be last thing my taste buds ever enjoyed. I highly suggest wearing the bib they give you - unless of course you like to wear your dinner proudly.   Even if you aren't a shrimp fan; their filets are always cooked to perfection and their gumbo is delicious.   Don't forget to grab a cocktail too - their Bloody Mary's will save your life.   They even have a room in the back for private parties - which is great for rehearsal dinners; graduation parties; etc.   Mr. B's is the B's knees! [REVIEW_4] AMAZING! What can I really say about this place? A LOTTTT! If your not into chiropractor type of things; this place will make you change your mind about it! It doesnt hurt to give it a try. You never know until you try it and EXPERIENCE it yourself. Especially with Dr. Blake. He is the man to go to if you have back pains; neck pains; any issue what so ever just ask away! He is very knowledgeable in what he does; answering everything questions you have for him. Just ask away he doesnt bite! Well not that i know of? JK. LOL The place is a little small; but will still do the job. If you want privacy then close the door or let whoever there knows or you can be like me and not give a care in the world because we all are human beings LOL. Make sure to be clean and freshly showered because its more hands on and physical activities. Loving the adjustment Dr. Blake be working on my neck since im dealing with a lot of pain due to injuries. Makes my neck easier to maneuver and look around since its difficult for me to be doing so ): Just give them a call in advance and ask away. From what they can do to help you and etc. This is actually my first experiencing Chiropractor so far and so far ""IM LOVING"" it like mcdonalds would say it! Just want you guys to feel the same experience as i did. If you found my review helpful let me know. Let them know its Toe-Knee(Tony) that sent you if u really think my review was awesome. [REVIEW_5] I want to thank Eric @paintlessautodents.com  Eric is a wizard! I purchased a preowned Cadillac XTS from Coleman Cadillac. There was a minor dent to the car that I requested be fixed before I would purchase the car. Coleman promised that they would have it fixed shortly after delivery. I met Eric from paintlessautodents today at Coleman Cadillac and the man did an awesome job on the car; I cannot tell that there was ever an imperfection in the area he fixed. I highly recommend his services and will not hesitate to use him again should the need arise. Eric does come from Philadelphia and will not come North of the Lawrenceville/Princeton area. I cannot discuss prices as the dealership picked up the cost. Eric is the owner of the company and clearly takes pride in his work. Before taking your car to an auto body shop I Recommend reaching out to Eric first as he may save you time; money and inconvenience. [REVIEW_6] We didn't have reservations but were able to be seated. The service was terrific. The portions for both dinner and dessert were large. They have Coke products. It's BYOB. I'd definitely return. I'd make reservations because I felt badly causing the hostess to rearrange tables to accommodate our party of 5. [REVIEW_7] As an active runner my shoes are my life force. Endurance House has a fantastic selection of shoes for all runners.  The staff are always nice and helpful. What sets them apart from other stores is how they check for what shoe will best suit your stride and reduce injury.  I will happily keep coming back and know that I will get a good price; a great pair of shoes; and have personalized help. [REVIEW_8] First time here tonight. We got a salted caramel cupcake; a mocha chocolate chip cupcake; and a peanut butter pudding. The cupcakes were moist;  the frosting was so silky and creamy; so good. But the star of the show was the peanut butter pudding. Holy crow.  Never had anything like it before.  It was more of a creamy;whipped; mousse like pudding. The peanut butter flavor was not too sitting strong or overwhelming like peanut butter can be.  Throughout was some of her peanut butter cookies.  So soft;  it mixed wth the pudding like perfection. We live in nj but we will absolutely be back! [REVIEW_9] The fried green tomato BLT is amazing!!! Great prices & awesome live music shows by Chris Caminiti & many awesome local artists & song writers. [REVIEW_10] Excellent service; food; and price! If you want easy-going atmosphere like you had when you were a child  back in the day at grandma's house then this is the place to be! [REVIEW_11] Me and my boyfriend stopped here traveling through Riverway and it was the best decision we made all weekend. We had the fried tofu as an appetizer and we both had the chicken pad Thai. The food was fresh; made from scratch and so tasty. It wasn't greasy at all and didn't give that full bloated feeling afterwards. The service was impeccable and the prices were great for the portions. There is also a separate vegan menu! We will be returning! [REVIEW_12] What a treat!  Unplugged brings a great wine bar to downtown Tucson.  I've been here multiple times; and I love the wine selection they have.  The ambiance is beautiful; and the bites are delicious!  I could go on ranting about how great it is; but you'll have to try for yourself! [REVIEW_13] I stay at this hotel every time I come to Tarpon Springs. The hotel is nice and quiet. Minutes away from a movie theater; comedy club and tons of restaurants. Comfy beds. Free wifi. The TVs also have hdmi ports; so bring a chromecast; fire stick or game console for added entertainment. My check in was a breeze. Took less than two minutes. Jean checked me in and she was so nice for someone working the night shift at a hotel. The breakfast was great. Hot food every morning. Plenty of hot food every morning. You can eat breakfast in dining area or take it to your room like I did. I highly recommend Hampton Inn! always a great stay... Also the pool is open pretty much year round I think. [REVIEW_14] The massage with the basic pedi is the best part!!! It was pretty long and the hot stone at the end was a nice touch [REVIEW_15] Although only a short distance from the French Quarter; Frenchman Street is like stepping into a different realm. It's only two-blocks long but full of life and non-stop entertainment and on any given day of the week; you can hear the live sounds of reggae to Latin to blues.  To kick off a night on Frenchman Street; it's best to do so on a full stomach so stopped into Mojitos Rum Bar and Grill on the edge of Frenchman Street for dinner and a warm up to a night out on the town.  Just like a lot of the other places in the area; Mojitos has their own live entertainment and if u stay late enough on Saturdays a Latin music party. All of this takes place on their beautiful patio but you also do have the option of indoor dining but I highly recommend that you do not do that. Even consider sitting at their large outdoor bar before doing that.  Going to a place called Mojitos means you have to get a Mojito. Due to their namesake; they have plenty of options from specialty drinks to the typical fruit flavor kind. I started off with The Frenchman which was amazing and thank fully strong.  Later on; I decided to get another drink and selected the Ultimate Mojito. I know it said mint syrup and I don't know what I was thinking but it was the ultimate fail. It tasted just like syrup; medicine syrup. If you 'bout that sizzrup; this may be the drink for you.  We order the Jerk Chicken Skewer as a starter and it was so unbelievable delicious! Do you know how hard it is to go to a place that doesn't specialize in Jamaican food and for them to actually get it right? The flavors were on point and the spice level was beyond expectations. To offset the spicy factor; the blackberry brandy sauce added just the right touch.  There are only four choices for main dishes; but they all sounded so good; I still had a hard time deciding. I ended up ordering the Aruba Scallop. It came with grits and I am actually NOT a fan of grits but these were well flavored and a great compliment to the delicate and well cooked and prepared scallops. A dish like this has potential to lack flavor; but it was really good and had a nice kick to it.  My boyfriend ordered the Lechon Asado or as the menu states; citrus marinated roasted Kurobota pork belly. The meal was served with rice and beans. He thought it was really good taste wise; but was disappointed in the portion size which I guess was a little small but I was full after eating my meal.  I was very satisfied with the food; service; atmosphere and entertainment. It is a great place to hang out; to drink or eat food. It's a great place period. I will be back. [REVIEW_16] The service was so very bad. We walked out after waiting half an hour for any food to appear. Avoid this place. [REVIEW_17] This is the best Mexican in St. Louis. The service is always so great and the food is authentic and fast! [REVIEW_18] I am not an indian food type of person but this place lives up to the hype. When you go; just let Hassan make something for you; don't try and overwhelm yourself with the different options. Make sure to get a chaat and a lassi as the two really complement one another. [REVIEW_19] Staying here every year while in New Orleans!! Beautiful scenery; clean and safe. They have a wonderful breakfast every morning; staff is so kind and attentive. This hotel has so much history wouldn't stay anywhere else. [REVIEW_20] We finally made it to the Best in the West Nugget Rib Cook-Off this year.  We didn't stay as long as I had hoped since food coma set in real quickly but we had a good time nonetheless :)  There were so many rib vendors it just smelled awesome walking around.  They also had a section that sold other goods you'd find at a typical flea market.  Our favorite ribs we tried was definitely Bone Daddy's; the ribs fell off the bone; was not dry at all; and their bar-be-que sauce was totally yum!  Goodi's Lemonade was a great way to wash it all down and the hubby loved how there were many bar/alcohol vendors set up around the cook-off also.  Definitely coming back next year and this time we are not eating at all before we head out. [REVIEW_21] Spent a Saturday afternoon here; and the pools and deck were crowded; but our server; Travis was awesome! He was attentive to our needs; and had great suggestions for our lunch. Drinks were delivered promptly.  Travis is a local; and very friendly. He was an encyclopedia of local places; and tipped is on where to find sand dollars that was spot on.   It was hot; but it's a beach; and there are two pools to cool off in right next to the bar and patio. Live music was great also. We had burgers and sandwiches and fries; and the good was great. If you go; wear a swimsuit and enjoy the refreshing pools! Didn't deal with bartenders; but rum runners were excellent; and so was our server; Travis! [REVIEW_22] We sat in the upstairs piano bar and it was so romantic. White linen tablecloths with candles and a man playing and singing romantic songs on the piano. We did some slow dancing along with some other couples. The food was delicious also! I loved the atmosphere! [REVIEW_23] First time tonight. We enjoyed our evening with a great server; Alison. She knew we had not been here before and helped us through everything. Most of all we spent a lot of time catching up with old friends; and we never felt hurried.  The food was great; and we tried everything from steaks to meat loafs. All was prepared to our request and the meals were great.  Look forward to coming back. Hope it is just as good next time. [REVIEW_24] I dig this place. Great Cobb salad. Great flatbreads. Amazing BBQ sandwich. Super solid ingredients; pretty good service and a nice cafe environment. Not the cheapest place in the world; but it has delicious food. Always worth it. [REVIEW_25] I followed the fabulous Liz here last year and have been really impressed by this place; they go the extra mile to make clients feel welcome and pampered with drinks; nibbles; and a soothing environment. Maria does an incredible job with threading--my eyebrows look fabulous thanks to her careful shaping! (She's a little pricey; though; but for something as important as good eyebrow work it's worth it; in my opinion.) [REVIEW_26] Barrister's is tops!  Shiela's weekday service is exceptional; as is the quality of the bagels!  She is highly organized; efficient; and caring; making your bagel just the way you like it.   Move over; NYC - best bagels on the East Coast are now right here in Royersford.  Go; Shiela! Bravo; Barrister's! [REVIEW_27] This place was fantastic. The pizza rolls are not similar in shape to those frozen things; they're actually made like cinnamon rolls; with pizza dough instead of pastry and sauce/fillings instead of cinnamon sugar. They're amazing.  I got one of the daily specials; which was puppy drum (fish) with a side of pasta. I wasn't a huge fan of the fish; but I think I just don't like puppy drum as much as I expected to. It was prepared fine; though. The pasta is obviously homemade and the marinara is delicious.  My boyfriend got a dish that I can't remember the name of; but it was basically pasta; shrimp; and mushrooms in a rich butter sauce. Shrimp Diane maybe? It was very good. I actually ended up eating his leftovers; and I might get that next time.   The bread is good; though very full of sesame seeds; so beware if that's not your thing. We finished with the tiramisu. The flavor was great; but the texture was too wet for my taste. Again; it's more a matter of taste than anything they did wrong. We'll definitely try the ""cherrymisu"" next time; which is tiramisu but with cherry juice in place of coffee.   The service was fantastic; the place was clean; it was easy to park.   However; my absolute favorite thing was hearing one of the cooks tell another; ""I'll be back; I'm going to go peel some shrimp."" I love a place that uses fresh seafood and does things without cutting corners.   I will 100% be returning; and I'm already thinking about what I'm going to order. [REVIEW_28] Not happy at all. We had been waiting outside while it's cold and raining for about 10 minutes when A group of ""regular customers""  walk up and go get​ a table before everyone else that was waiting. Those ""regulars"" were out side bragging about how they didn't have to wait like everyone else. Forget the fact that I'm pregnant; I have two children with me. There were four groups of other people ahead of them. The young guy who calls people in lied to our faces when I asked why they were seated before the one that had been waiting for awhile. I physically saw them pull up in there vehicle and walk up. So I know for a fact they were not here before us. Thanks to them not only my family but other families with very small children had to wait an extra ten minutes. This will be our first and last time here. I do not recommend coming here if everyone it's treated fairly. Very poor customer service!!!! [REVIEW_29] Wasn't that busy they might have had 4 servers on. Our server took forever to get us CANNED BEERS; we NEVER GOT OUR WATERS. Our appetizer came AFTER we finished our food. They comped it; but didn't try to make amends about the rest of horrible experience. We will NEVER GO BACK. [REVIEW_30] The Peppermill is beautiful; clean and easy to get around for such a large hotel.  It's the only hotel we will stay at in Reno from now on.",27
28,"[REVIEW_1] Best breakfast tacos i have ever had. The breakfast burger is phenomenal as well. Great service too! Awesome atmosphere ! [REVIEW_2] oh.  my.  god.  i went here for south street's ""restaurant week"" (3 courses; 30$) last weekend and it was amazing.  And that should say a lot considering that a lot of restaurants use restaurant weeks to half-assedly  crank out dishes for the masses in an assembly-line manner.    But not here.  every dish was excellent; and even artistic!  I had the avocado ceviche; barbacoa (perfectly cooked); and chocolate souffle cake with cajeta ice cream.  We also ordered the custom-made guacomole for the table; a server came out and made it for us right at the table. And just as swiftly as he had made it; the four of us devoured it.  SO good.  And the waitress was super-attentive and more than willing to offer recommendations.  On top of everything; the place has a very cool atmosphere and is on a stretch of south street which is very pretty; especially on a temperate spring/summer night--perfect for a little post-dinner stroll or if you're en route to some bar hopping later.  Try this place--you won't regret it. [REVIEW_3] Three Dog Night had a popular song that hit number 1 on the charts in the 70's. It was appropriately called ""One"". In the lyrics; it stated; ""One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do"". That may be true in love; but when it comes to dining sometimes you just want to dine alone.  If you do; avoid HWK.   Not once; but twice I have been turned  away when wanting to dine here as a single person. The first time when I called to make a reservation; the young lady who answered informed me they preferred not to sit single diners at tables and that I'd have to eat at the bar.  At first I was content with that arrangement; but then she continued to tell me that  those eating at the bar can not select from the entire menu. At that point; I decided not to make the reservation.  I wanted the true HWK experience. After all the reviews have been amazing.   The second time; I stopped in for early lunch while shopping the main drag in Maplewood.  Once again; I was told I'd have to sit at the bar and order from a ""limited menu"". When I asked if I could be seated at one of the hightops in the window; she told me she needed to save those for parties of two. The kicker came when I asked if they were already reserved and she said; ""no"".  I ate else where that day.   What I do not understand; is why can I go to Chicago dine at such top restaurants such as; Girl and the Goat; RL; The Pump Room; Table Fifty-Two; The Purple Pig; Frontera Grill and The Publican and be welcomed with open arms. Many of the chefs at these restaurants have been on Top Chef and published cookbooks.  How is it that their establishments are welcoming to the lone diner; yet a small Maplewood restaurant is not?  I understand they have a small space; but if you are going to sit single diners at the bar; let them order from the entire menu. Before posting; I shared this review with other friends who are single diners and being women; they said for them they would not feel comfortable eating at the bar and would not eat here if a table was not an option.   Disclaimer: I did dine here as a couple opening week and was not impressed. I contributed that to opening week jitters and wanted to give them another chance. It is a shame that I have not had that opportunity. [REVIEW_4] This place!!! It is SO well worth the wait! I had to try the bananas foster pancakes and grits with turkey sausage...let's just say; I'll be back! And the excellent service rounded out the whole wonderful experience. Keep it up! [REVIEW_5] Had a great time on the dinner cruise with friends. Thankfully the weather was breezy so it was fun standing outside on the bow; especially as the lights came on on shore. The music was delightful and it was a really fun way to cap off our vacation in NOLA. [REVIEW_6] The goal of the day was to fill our bellies with warm and tasty ramen; and I am so happy to say we did that a Cheu! My friends and I actually started with the Black Garlic Wings (6); which is great to share with 3 people. The wings were tangy and sweet; very flavorful; and I definitely recommend giving them a try. We also ordered the Butternut Rangoon; and can I just say that I could probably eat like twenty of those and be so happy with my life. They were so light and crispy; and absolutely addicting.  I ordered the Coconut Curry Noodles with a marinated egg. The the broth was so full of curry and a sweet coconut flavor; it was delicious! I also appreciated that the broth had a bit of heat to it; because the spicier the better in my opinion.The noodles were soft; and filling--so fun to slurp right up.   For two apps; and three bowls; it came out to $26; including tip; and I was full for the rest of the day!Definitely recommend trying this spot if you're ever in the city and need something to warm you up. I will be back to Cheu sometime soon! [REVIEW_7] I've been here 3 times so far and each time I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. I've tried the peanut butter infused cold brew and iced americano I liked them both.  My mom had the cortado which she raved about. But the treats they home make here are my favorite part. Like the chocolate chia pudding topped with toasted coconut and raspberries is DELICIOUS :) Also the PB ball with chia seeds; coconut; oats; and chocolate chips goes perfectly with my coffee. This coffee shop is unique and has its own charm I love it! [REVIEW_8] I loooooooooooove this place the food the service the atmosphere everything is just EXCEPTIONALLLLL Mofongo to die for and the house Sangria!!!! If you are looking for a good place with some authentic Puerto Rican dishes this is the place YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. [REVIEW_9] Coffeebar is awesome.  The service is ALWAYS friendly; and my beverage is always tasty. [REVIEW_10] Delicious and the waitress was awesome!  We stayed there for lunch for almost 3 hours and never felt rushed and we never felt like we were overstaying our welcome.  Great food!  Great service!!! [REVIEW_11] If you looking for Crabs Legs This is the best place to eat them. I see people complain about the prices but this place is worth it. We drive from St. Amant La monthly for this wonderful Seafood [REVIEW_12] I held my husband's surprise birthday party for about 35 people in the basement bar at Black Sheep. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. From the first call I placed to inquire about hosting the party and spoke with James; the owner; to the night of the party where Adam; our bartender; made sure all went smoothly; everyone I dealt with was fantastic. Overall; a great experience. [REVIEW_13] Very very good and kid friendly! Had the duck and a Sazerak! The atmosphere and the best best gumbo I have had in the French Quarter! [REVIEW_14] ......So I'm from Cali where there are no shortage of Vegan joints; and I must say this place would for sure be stiff competition for a few of the Cali franchise joints. And the Staff was beyond Stellar. And they where open during a snow storm.......Loved It!! [REVIEW_15] Loved the atmosphere here. Everything in the shop was beautiful and well put together. The barista was really great and helped me find a drink that I would like; and she was right; I loved it. Definitely will be back next time I'm in the area. [REVIEW_16] After a long hiatus from reviewing I have awaken from my 6 mouth yelp hibernation and my tummies a grumbles with an insatiable hunger for the cacophonous symphony of flavor that is Indian food. Like an all too familiar pattern; I go back to Mohammad Butt; my main man for marsala. But whats this?  There are whispers that he no longer cooks for ""Best Taste of Asia;"" that he is gone; never to return; some sort of falling out.  No. No; it can't be!  I need to score - one .. final .. hit..  Life ceases to have meaning; existential murmurings dog the mind. Who am I? Why am I here? What is Cheeze Wiz? Its done; over; a round falls into the chamber and just as I prepare to end it all and pull the trigger- steps in ZAIKA.  Zaika - meaning the art of taste -  stays to to its name. This is a place where the Paneer (cheese) is made fresh in house; resulting in a cheese that's silky in texture. Especially when in contrast to the prepackaged rubbery bone-white LEGO blocks most small Indo-Pak places purchase from Indian Grocers in attempts to reduce prep-times. While at Zaika such shortcuts are not taken;  the Chef takes the extra steps needed to ensure a dish comes together as a whole. For example; the Chicken Makhani uses Smokey Tandoori Chicken; which I have never seen done before but it certainly aids the chicken to cut though the rich buttery tomato sauce and elevates the dish as a whole. Even entrées like Dall Fray or  Palak Paneer  have so much flavor that they will leave you not missing animal protein in the least should you choose to go the vegetarian route.   Zaika 's appetizers; like the Veggie Samosa and Aloo Tikki; (spiced potato patties) are generally large; peppery and well spiced - the latter of which remind me of something my own mother would make. Though I must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop-up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers; unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment. These peppers are spicy; not deveined or even seeded. Further; I find the fish pakora to be far too fishy.   I've become rather taken by Zaikia. Even the simply things such as the naan are good there. Just right in elasticity; the bread does not have too much give and yet isn't too soft. It's nothing elaborate; just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor. The only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has. But hey; I use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix; so I don't mind at all.  The menu has nearly 120 different items; all numbered to order by; making take-out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem. Furthermore; it has short descriptions of each dish - something all ethnic places like this should have. Though some items like Lassie (a frothy yogurt drink) do not appear on the menu; that too is offered - both a salty and sweet mango verities.  The head chef speaks English quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders.  I have already noticed parties negotiating catering for Ramadan as I anxiously awaited my own order.  The bottom line here is this; Mohammad Butt has expanded on the menu he once created for ""Best taste of Asia;"" and taken an all HALAL meat approach.   Only good things can come of this; only good things.  P.S. ZAIKA is right behind Nifty Fifties on Grant Ave.; so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake.  However; I would suggest getting the Ras Malai if available. These riccotta cheese dumplings flouting in soaked in sweetened; thickened milk are delicately flavored with cardamom; a very some amount of rose water and then garnished with pistachios. They are ungodly good. [REVIEW_17] I moved to Missouri about 3 years ago and it was so hard to find a stylist for my needs. I went through a year of bad hair cuts; color and styling. I decided to challenge any stylist willing to call my stylist back home to get my info. This fantastic sams and stylist was the only one out of at least six that accepted this challenge. Called me super excited and let me know she had my info and was ready for me.. it turned out amazing... like really amazing! I have been coming here ever since. They are friendly and honest; they won't tell you they know how to do something and not really know. Depending on your request they will even tell you which one of them is best at that. Hands down the best hair salon in Missouri! [REVIEW_18] Great experience. I reserved online one hour prior to checking the bike out. The bike was in good shape and exceeded my expectation. Will return in the future. [REVIEW_19] Op suggestie van yelp- hier geweest op onze eerste avond in NOLA tijdens onze roadtrip (dag3). It's the best place. Wachttijden kunnen oplopen; maar waar Nederland vaak faliekant in faalt; gaat hier geweldig: er wordt door t personeel vlijmscherp in de gaten gehouden wie er aan de beurt is; zelfs voor de krukken aan de bar. Bijna gingen er mensen die later waren gearriveerd dan wij er met onze lang verwachte krukken vandoor; maar de barman regelde dit op sublieme wijze. Het moraal van dit verhaal- je raakt hier niet geïrriteerd omdat andere mensen voor schnitzelen. Ondertussen word je getrakteerd op de lekkerste live muziek en hebben ze er heerlijke cocktails en prima wijnen. Eten was ondergeschikt deze avond; maar wat we hadden was bijzonder goed. Dikke aanrader- wellicht reserveren als je niet van eindeloos wachten houdt. [REVIEW_20] Yum.  I love to swing by Smiley's on my way home from work and pick up a vegetarian falafel platter. Their falafel is perfection! Far; far better than Couch Tomato (no surprise there since this is a Mediterranean joint). Prices are fair; food is super fresh. Their hummus is silky with just a hint of lemon. Yes; carryout can take a little while but everything is made to order so I'm happy to wait or just call ahead. Do not miss this great little place!! [REVIEW_21] Our family returned for breakfast again this weekend and the food and service was again impeccable ... Highly recommend [REVIEW_22] I used a Groupon for this sushi and i was soooo glad. I really enjoyed the sushi it was super fresh and tasty. When you go try the asparagus and shrimp roll; the caterpillar roll and the spicy mussel roll. You will not be disappointed!  Ohhh yeah cant forget the waitress we had was super sweet and kind! [REVIEW_23] My favorite burger in town! The place is confortabke and has a great variety of drinks with bourbon. They should have a reservation policy. [REVIEW_24] I chose this restaurant for brunch with my boyfriend; based on the fact that I wanted eggs benedict. The Yelp reviews were pretty positive; so I figured we'd give it a go. Most of the reviewers are correct. This food is FANTASTIC and made with high quality ingredients.  Given that we were going the Sunday before Memorial Day; I called ahead to make sure they had some availability. The hostess told me we'd have a table for 1pm; and we arrived a little early. Another couple also had a table for 2 for 1pm; but due to a clerical error; they could only seat one of us. We gave it to the other couple. This ended up being a pattern for their other patrons who presumably arrived on time and had to wait. This is a pretty bad error considering how much it happened; but given the rest of the experience; I can't deduct a star over something like this. Just be aware that it happens. They were very busy that day; so it took a while for us to get served; but again; not enough of an issue to deduct a star.  My boyfriend and I enjoyed the quaint environment and bright colours of the place. It had the same feel as Pop Shop; a grilled cheese place in Collingswood; NJ. It was very cozy; well lit; and country style; what with the counter you can eat at.  We split an order of blue duck fries to start; and they came in a mountainous pile in a large white bowl. Gouda was melted over them with a healthy portion of green onions; as well as some juicy pulled duck meat. Honestly; our meal could have ended there. We were so pleased with them and devoured them in silence- a sure sign of amazing food.  Since both of us came in wanting eggs benedict; we ordered it. Duck benedict with a perfectly poached egg; topped with more green onion and a SRIRACHA HOLLANDAISE. Yes; you read that. Expecting the usual overly hyped sriracha dish; we were proven wrong when the perfectly textured sauce had a nice sweet finish to it; as true to hollandaise. The bread the benedict was placed on tasted like nothing less than homemade bread (could be wrong; but it was fresh and fantastic). The duck on these eggs was probably 3/4in thick- it was extremely juicy and was a very generous; flavourful cut. Nothing in the duck benedict overpowered anything else. All fantastic flavours were appreciated and identifiable.   All in all; service was meh; but the brunch food 100% overshadows any issue we had with the service. A warning; though; the brunch menu is not very extensive. The choices; however; are very diverse in flavour and taste. Do not pass up this gem. [REVIEW_25] Excellent variety on the menu. A couple items for vegetarians. Amazing oyster omelet; pancakes; cinnamon bun; and French toast on the brunch menu.  Friendly staff and interesting cocktails. Definitely worth another visit. [REVIEW_26] Loved this spot! We came here for a late bite after a 76ers game and sat at the bar. The brussel sprouts were bomb and my boyfriend loved his burger. Great service - they kept my champagne glass filled the whole night! [REVIEW_27] Express Scripts called me as they offer services through my insurance carrier. I was mistrusting at first; and then as I was on the phone I looked up the Yelp reviews-- I think it's the worst-reviewed company I've ever seen! But I decided to give it a shot anyway because it sounded convenient. I made my order. Nine days later a 3 month supply showed up in the mail for 50% less than my local pharmacy. Great; easy service. [REVIEW_28] I'm from out of town and picked up an awful sinus infection. I neeeeeded hot and sour soup. I got broth with some vegetables and about 2 ounces of corse ground pepper. It was awful. I ordered for my son and husband and their food was awful. The crab Rangoon was burnt.  Three entrees; 1 pint hot and sour soup and one order crab Rangoon. It was almost 60 bucks for tiny boxes of food. [REVIEW_29] You will not find a more authentic place as this. From the decor to the food to the wait staff Mercedes parked out back. This is 100% Greek and authentic. Food is fantastic from the pita bread and hummus to the authentic Greek cuisine. While it may have touristy feel there are plenty of locals and Greek people eating here. I enjoyed every min of our experience here. There were so many choices on the menu that it was tough to choose. I had the combination along with a Greek salad. Delicious.  You won't be disappointed. [REVIEW_30] This Kroger has been hanging on by a thread for the last twenty years or more. The head office is always trying to kill it from inside; but it survives. Like they say; it is what it is. Don't expect everything to be stocked in this small store. They have most things one needs or wants. I like it because it is just a short walk for me. The produce is fresh. So is the dairy. And; hey; they fixed the doors and put the ""in"" on the right now.",28
29,"[REVIEW_1] Another hidden gem in a strip mall of all places; in NE Philly. Cute little place with clean open decor; with a  smell that hits you when you first walk in; that can only be described as heaven. Friendly helpful wait staff and the food was beyond  delicious. Highly recommend a trip to NE philly for brunch. Kudos  go out to the Judge boys who own the Blue Duck; we will definitely be back. [REVIEW_2] Had a truly awesome experience at North Penn Mazda today. Our daughter purchased her very first car; a 2016 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring. Joe and the team at Mazda worked tirelessly to get her the car she wanted and an awesome price. From the time we walked in until the time we left; they made us feel like we were the only ones in the dealership. There's not enough words to describe our first experience with this dealership! Highly recommend!!!! [REVIEW_3] Shane was the best !! We will definitely come back for him. Came in for a bachelorette and he was attentive; funny and helpful on suggesting fun places around the city to check out. We feel lucky having him ! [REVIEW_4] Had breakfast with the family after a quick stopover. Great food and service (thanks Jonathan!); definaelty a good find that was busy but had no wait on a Saturday. [REVIEW_5] Just as many others have stated; I too had a work related gathering here. This was my first time attending and the event had a set menu. Maybe next visit I'll see their actual menu. Being vegetarian when I saw my group had already chosen either fish or steak I knew I was gonna have to be THAT person and ask for an alternative. The host; of course; were more than happy to accommodate me. They mentioned their Sweet Potato Agnolotti so I accepted. It was amazing. I also enjoyed their house Cabernet a lot. The room that was reserved for us was on the second floor. It was nice to be able to mix and mingle on the balcony before our event began. The host were phenomenal as well. I can't wait to return. [REVIEW_6] Great little find! Came here for brunch & built my own Bloody Mary.I also had their roast beef signature sandwich.  Good service too!  I will def come back for more [REVIEW_7] This place is gross.  The bathroom was dirty; with peeling paint and rusting fixtures.  Old AC unit made horrible noises every time it shut off.  The previous guests left some sort of food in the microwave; indicating that it had not been cleaned.  The rates were low; but the Howard Johnson or Motel 6 next door couldn't possibly be worse.  Not worth it; go somewhere else. [REVIEW_8] Another massage therapist referred me to her;  and I'm so glad that she did! As a service provider myself; i have a lot of tension and muscle challenges.  Her massage was one of the most relaxing and effective massages I've ever had!  (Thing I loved the most:  she used hot rice bags to relax the muscles of my neck and back while  she massaged other areas) [REVIEW_9] Total Wine & More is much; much better. I don't this this BevMo location will be open much longer. There are probably a maximum of 2 employees working here at any given time. Most of of their inventory is out of date and overpriced by a wide margin.  No wonder this place is so empty. [REVIEW_10] I reserved a full sized car. When I arrived at my scheduled time; they had none. The salesman sold me on accepting a Kia Soul; he told me it was the equivalent of full sized vehicle. When I got home; knowing nothing about this vehicle; I did some research. It is classified as a sub compact. So Enterprise took my full payment for a full sized vehicle and completely screwed me. I don't have time to go back to the rental office; so I am stuck paying full price for a sub compact; and I have to use this vehicle for a 1400 mile trip. Never again will I use this rental agency. Don't be like me; do better research and be prepared when they try to screw you over! [REVIEW_11] When your waitress says ""the kitchen is crashing and burning"" you know this isn't going to go well. My husband's beer sat empty while she focused on her only other table. Another waitress stepped in to get him a refill. Two of our three meals came out. Thinking his pizza was on the way we went ahead and started eating. 15 mins later his pizza is MIA and the waitress was confused as to why he wanted to cancel his order and have it taken off the bill. There was no manager visible and the situation could've been handled much better. It's a shame because they have great food and good beer. We won't be back. [REVIEW_12] This is the best Vietnamese food in Reno. The owners used to own and run S&K noodles up in Sparks and it was the best before they sold that location. The noodle dish with pork; egg rolls and shrimp is always a must!  Everything else I have tried has always been great. [REVIEW_13] I took my gf for our one year anniversary here;  this cute little hidden  away restaurant was fantastic. Wasn't too uptight; wasn't snobbish; our waiter was very easy going and greeted us by name as we entered. The food was wonderful; and the wine list extensive. Will definitely return  Also the desert crepes made at the table were fantastic! [REVIEW_14] I dont leave reviews but had to as my experience tonight left a really sour taste in my mouth.  Walked in the restaurant to place a take out order for two pho dishes. Paid by card & left a 4$ tip on a 22$ takeout order.   As they gave me the food i asked if i could have hot sauce as well and was told by the young man that thats 1$ extra... i had no cash only card but i was surprised because i was just there yesterday cus my bf is sick and picked up an order with the hot sauce without having to pay anything for it. The older man yesterday was super friendly to me and said if i ever need sauce to just ask so i was baffled that now i had to pay for it. Additionally this is the same sauce that is sitting on the table. I didn't ask for extra sauce! I let the young man know that if he wanted to charge me a $1 to go ahead but i had gotten it for free before to which he replied the rules have changed. And when i said that was yesterday he mumbled and walked away and begrudgingly filled a container for me and as he handed it said next time its a 1$...   Why do i have to pay extra to get the same sauce sitting on the table which i got for free the other day. Secondly i tipped u $4 on takeout. Ive worked in the business. People rarely tip for pickup so you still have the nerve to be a dick... I walked away with the food pissed off that this really just happened. and he had the nerve to yell nothing is free as i was walking away. All this commotion occurred with customers in the store.  Great customer service!   Oh and when i get home only one bag of toppings was provided for two orders; with only 1 lime wedge to be shared by two people...   Sucks as this is the only pho place around and i finally grew to like their pho. Refuse to go back and give my money to that little twerp. [REVIEW_15] We always check Yelp before trying a new place.  Based on the reviews I saw here we were quite surprised with the meal we had.  Young waitress was very polite and accommodated our time crunch as we were trying to catch a show-the food however was pretty disappointing.  The sauce was very watery and the vegetables in the two dishes we ordered were frozen vegetables.  Watery spicy sauce on frozen vegetables- eh. [REVIEW_16] Couldn't have asked for a better location but horrible maid service and not worth the price. Horrible communication between the staff. The room was nice but didn't include a mini fridge or blow drier. The wi-fi was also a problem. It stopped working and when I asked the front desk about it they told me to call a number.... Which I was on hold for too long with. The pool was heated and had a nice view but one night was hot tub hot and the next was luke warm. Wouldn't recommend this hotel. [REVIEW_17] Very disappointing customer service here. Seems like the employees are too busy running around restocking shelves to actually assist customers. Looks like the issue is poor management. I prefer clothing stores that focus more on customer service than stocking shelves. [REVIEW_18] This store was such a huge disappointment. We are new to Arizona; and I was excited to visit due to the great reviews. I went in search of kitschy SW décor; and I couldn't stay long. The entire store reeked of urine. It was more than my poor nose could handle. [REVIEW_19] I don't understand the hubbub about burritos that are 75% rice. No wonder they call themselves ""healthy"". I wish someone would open a Baja Fresh in Tucson. Much better. [REVIEW_20] Top Tomato is one of my go-to pizza/italian shops in the area; and I have been eating here a few times a year for the past 3-4 years. My favorite pie is the jersey tomato pie; which has ample; chunky tomato sauce with a moderate thickness crust and plenty of cheese. When I'm in the mood for pasta; I get the penne rustica  (penne with chicken; mushrooms; tomatoes; veggies) or chicken marsala. Casual setting with sporting events on in the background and top hits on in the background. [REVIEW_21] There is a banner on the website that says ""free shipping over $50"". This company hates honoring this promotion and it's always a a hassle to get the free shipping and they conveniently have the shopping cart set up to always charge the shipping fee even if your order total qualifies for the free shipping. Anyway; my order total came to $160 but I was still charged shipping at checkout. So I called cust svc and spoke to an idiot beyotch that was hostile and completely mathematically challenged and illogical; as her defense was that since I used a coupon on my order; I should be okay with paying the shipping fee. Huh?! When that excuse didn't work; she then said I wasn't charged shipping for the conditioner (I had 4  items on my order). Umm; that makes no sense; as I'm still paying shipping on the other items (that are packaged in the same box as the ""freely shipped"" conditioner); plus the  shipping fee is a flate rate; so what good is it if one item out of 4 is shipped free?!  I have spent hundreds of dollars w/ this company but will never ever shop here again. My advice to all consumers is to bankrupt companies that don't appreciate your business. [REVIEW_22] Good value and great pizza.  We stumbled upon the place last night after a long day of running around with my kids - 8 & 10.  Kids menu was great.  They loved it and a great deal including a drink with plenty of fries left over.   I ordered a salad (terrific) but added a pizza to go after too much temptation.  Very very good!  The staff was very attentive.  Seems to be family run and certainly putting a lot of effort into serving their cleintele. [REVIEW_23] MY review is based on the sales department. The service department is AMAZING and are not relevant to this score. Also; Richard (aka Michael) at Ray Brandt was AMAZING. Great guy and made my test-driving experience one of the best! Unfortunate that the lease deal (that was not in his control) was nowhere close to honest or accurate.   BACKSTORY: Returning a VW Jetta lease just days before my lease is up. Went to Ray Brandt first (and did not just deal with one person; I dealt with 3+ not including Richard) because I initially leased from them and ended up running for the door. Called Southpoint VW immediately after and I have no words for how awesome they were. I'm just going to explain the difference between Southpoint VW and Ray Brandt VW:  RAY BRANDT: I am not in this ""90 day period"" to return my car so they will have to do me a PERSONAL favor and take the hit of my return fee and minor scratches (that added up to $1;300 btw). Meaning it was no longer an incentive for me to return my car; it was a personal favor I should be thankful for.  THEN on my quote print out.. there re-appears the $1;300! They snuck it back in my price thinking I would not notice and tried to cover up with some story about taking it out of my ""discount"" (but I followed what they were saying; and it indeed was a deception)  SOUTPOINT: No such thing as ""90 day period"".. I was leasing another VW; therefore they did not even care to inspect my car. I hand it in as is (assuming I had my 4 doors and bumper of course!).  --------- RAY BRANDT: I wanted the black Tiguan and I had to pay $200 transportation cost to get it from another dealer  SOUTHPOINT: No only did they pick up the black Tiguan from another dealer 100 miles away; they drove it all the way from Baton Rouge to my WORK! NO CHARGE! --------- RAY BRANDT: Expected I pay 70% of the MSRP in 36 months. WHAT?!?! and they had no explanation (except for jargon) when I asked three times for the break down and how that makes sense to THEM.   SOUTHPOINT: Paying 35% MSRP in 36 Months. BEFORE negotiation -------  RAY BRANDT: Any and all incentives (that I knew about beforehand) were now personal favors. Told me the price break-down print out was something they ""don't show people""!  Ok; only every other dealership I visited before showed me the print out WITHOUT that fancy line. I give my social; birthday; salary; credit history; and address... I think I more than deserve to know the details of my future car!   SOUTHPOINT: Gave max incentives; honored all deals online; adjusted discount to make whatever I put down still in ratio with other deals for down-payment promos that I wasnt participating in; wrote off $$ on contract based on negotiated prices we had talked about. Gave me all information and price details upfront.  ---------  RAY BRANDT: Jacked the MSRP price $1;200 more than market price claiming when the car comes from Germany it's a bit lower but once it gets to dealership they add things such as ""felt trunk separator"" and the ""first aid kit"" that factors the price higher. AGAIN... WHAT?!! hah!  SOUTHPOINT: MSRP was $4;000 lower than RAY BRANDT  (SAME EXACT CAR). Mind you- it's not actually ""lower"".. this IS the price of the car.  -------  RAY BRANDT: $467/month $1;000 down for basic factory standard Tiguan S 2016 (please look up so you can laugh that I could lease an AUDI for that much).   SOUTHPOINT: $256/month $0 down. SAME TIGUAN S 2016!!  -------  RAY BRANDT: Only saw me as easy $$$ and an ignorant consumer  SOUTHPOINT:  Respected me AND my wallet. They did EVERYTHING to make my experience as convenient as possible; honestly and ethically.   --------  Even if Ray Brandt dealership gave me a deal I couldn't resist; I still wouldn't be able to sign the contract because I don't trust them. [REVIEW_24] Not seeing any men's waxing reviews on here (perhaps I somehow missed them ...) I was a little hesitant to come in - fearing feminine brows. Long story short; I couldn't be happier! Jenne is a sweetheart; SO professional; and an eyebrow MASTER. They can definitely count on me to be a new regular. My brows are masculine; natural and neat and their pricing is absolutely reasonable. A gem! [REVIEW_25] Good service; excellent food and presentation.  Great price for portion sizes.  I'll definitely come back if I'm ever in Philadelphia again. [REVIEW_26] Good; steady Saturday business but they're a bit slow. They only have one person doing the Pre-wash; and while thorough; it slows up the line.  No military discount; but they do offer one for law enforcement. Nice waiting area with tv; pinball; bowling game; Galaga and...Ms. Pac-Man!!! 5 stars for that!! However; they lose 4 of those stars for shabby work. My rims looked absolutely horrible! Apparently; the car washing gauntlet does not reach the wheels/rims. Additionally; they completely failed to wipe any of the brake dust from any of the 4 rims. I called one of the attendants to re-do the rims but the 2nd go round wasn't much more remarkable.  For the $25 ""St. Charles"" wash; I'd like my rims to be washed and shining!  Do not EVER go here for your auto needs. [REVIEW_27] My boyfriend and I decided to go to The Smiling Elephant on a Friday night. We had about a 30 minute wait. Once we got inside we ordered. I got the Gai Jee and asked for it to be ""hot"". They gave me a sauce on the side. I poured it on top of my grilled chicken and white rice. I ate it and the sauce tasted awful. I thought maybe I was being picky so I let my boyfriend try. He thought it smelled and tasted awful. The only part of my meal that I could eat was the grilled chicken which was good; but not worth the price. Also the next day I was sick with food poisoning the entire day. I have never had food poisoning in my life and that was the only thing I had eaten differently in the past two days.  On the other hand. My boyfriend had the Pad Thai and he loved it. I tried it and it tasted pretty good.   No matter how good the Pad Thai was; I am not going to risk getting sick or getting a terrible meal again. [REVIEW_28] One of my favorite places ever; to grab a bite to eat. Small plates are the theme here.. But that does NOT mean you have to share ;) Their short rib panini's are to DIE for.. Not to mention that complimentary black truffle popcorn  Atmosphere is laid back; modern; and comfortable. Making it ideal for a lunch; dinner; or business date.  Staff is knowledgeable; personable; friendly and professional.   With a bright-innovative bar; complete with unique cocktail concoctions.. They have just about anything to accommodate the pickiest of palettes.. This is by far; one of my top 5's in Indy  very reasonably priced; you get a lot for what u pay for.. Esthetically pleasing; and full of flavor; check this place out; you won't regret it :) [REVIEW_29] Good bagels; but they can NEVER get an order right.  We live in NJ so when you ask for Taylor Ham and cheese you think they would be able to handle this.    Instead I get a ham and cheese sandwich; or an egg; ham and cheese sandwich.  I am DONE with this place.  City Market or Lumberville General Store will be my two choices from here on out. [REVIEW_30] If I could give them 0 stars I would. Horrible customer service. I order my coffee as follows; cold brew; no water; 2 shots. This tote always gives me and issue with this order saying that they cannot make it as follows; although the app offers that as an option for online ordering; and every other Starbucks out there has zero complications with this order. Infuriating.",14
30,"[REVIEW_1] I'll admit I messed up and tried to rent a car from another enterprise location and they didn't have a compact car ready for but they gave me an SUV for a discounted rate with no hesitation. Then a few days later when I found out my car would take a week to be done I called to get a compact car due to money issues and they told me to keep the SUV for the compact car rate! Can't beat that! This enterprise location is so nice; quick; and accommodating. When I'm in need of a rental it's the only place I'll go! [REVIEW_2] I try my hardest to only eat at local restaurants; but have to say that after last night's service for me and the people sitting at the communal table with me...I will never spend my hard earned money at this local establishment again. The disrespect and poor sevice from the kitchen and manager on duty was shocking.  I would appreciate communication from the owner of this restaurant.  You really need to understand how your visitors are being treated. [REVIEW_3] I am an amateur athlete. I first met Dr. Ferrel when I was playing softball. He was watching my game when I was severely injured.  He treated me on the field by relocating my ankle and then told me to come to his office for treatment. I told him I could not afford that as a single mom on a teacher's salary. Instead; I saw a physician. He said it would be months before I would play again. Depressed and without much hope; I reached out to Dr. Ferrel again. He did treat me as he promised. Not only did he treat me; he healed me within weeks instead of months. Over the years Dr. Ferrel has worked on me with amazing results each time. He will always be my hero... [REVIEW_4] Horrible horrible horrible experience. We have been residents of Santa Barbara for over 20 years. We own a small local business and two rental properties. Both the staff and owner are unprofessional and offer subpar work. They subcontract their jobs and don't have a foreman or supervisor present for the day of the job to assist in communication with us. All the workers just stand there and stare at you when you are asking any questions about installation and then tell you to call the office to speak to someone else! It was; honestly; amazingly unorganized. Very disappointed with the quality of the product; the warranty and the treatment by the owner and staff. Furniture was damaged and broken the day of the installation and never repaired.  Baseboards were not installed even though they were included in the price quote. Now less than a year later we are forced to replace the floors. Tried to follow up and resolve this directly and all they do is make excuses and lie. I would have rather gone to a big box store than have deal with these clowns. [REVIEW_5] Worst service ever. Ordered appetizers and meal and it took forever.  Look out if you want a drink refill because you might be able to drive home and come back and the drink might not be on the table.  Normally; getting food to take a while wouldn't bother  me but the restaurant was not even half full. [REVIEW_6] Never been a big fan of this place. Food is very mediocre; nothing special by any stretch but our last experience with Cafe Roma was just ridiculous.   We ordered online..waited an hour and then called to politely check on our order and got attitude by the person answering saying it typically takes 45 mins but its only been 59 mins. not an hour. Ok. So another 15 mins passes when my genius bf notices that he mis-typed his phone number so he calls to correct his mistake and was told that the food would not be coming. Period. We were shocked. Even without the phone number; they had our full address and we were not very far from the restaurant. They did not attempt to deliver; and had no intention of doing so.   No excuse for such unprofessional service. Shame; shame; shame. [REVIEW_7] The place is an insult to the Asian cuisine. I love all Asian; but I never had anything like this; It was a  horrible tasteless mess;  loaded with grease and sodium . [REVIEW_8] If I could give zero stars I would.  Service was slow and it wasn't busy. Order came out missing food. Place was disgustingly filthy. And the food....bland and super greasy. [REVIEW_9] I have had the pleasure of working with; and getting to know; the entire ""Family"" and team of Bella Vista Designs over the past 16 years.  They are my number one; go-to lighting and event production company. They are always friendly on the phone; quick with their proposals and efficient with any and all correspondence. I have even annoyingly texted their personal phones during out of office hours and received responses to my frantic questions.  They work extremely hard to ensure that all of my events are done well and thoroughly.  If there is ever an issue; they immediately send someone out to correct the problem. The owner; Trevor; has even driven over an hour out to a job-site; to personally ensure that my event was taken care of. I have gotten to know their setup crew well; and they go above and beyond in horrific wet weather; summer heat; muddy and dusty grounds. They even help with things that tent even their job sometimes! They are amazing at what they do and I highly recommend them! [REVIEW_10] Platoon is awesome and you definitely want Steve C as a trainer. When I started platoon; I was going once a week and attending a different group exercise class the other days of the week. After a few months; I was only coming to platoon 3-5 days a week. I loved how my workouts were customized to what I could do and wanted to do instead of a group workout that was impossible to complete. Steve is a great listener and motivator and sets realistic goals. The staff at platoon are very nice and accommodating. I never had a problem with billing or scheduling. [REVIEW_11] Well I had read many of these reviews before and had not visited this restaurant even though I live close by. BUT on the eve of Thanksgiving I was hungry and short on time a needed a quick bite before returning to work. I decided to give it a try....WRONG MOVE. Long story short; nothing is even good at this place. Everything is bland tasting.  We got the caprese salad (had to ask for extra balsamic since is was such a small drizzle on top.). My husbands pizza was so plain; the crust tasted stale and there was NO FLAVOR at all. My pasta dish was tolerable but needed tons of salt just to taste ok. Again NO flavor. Oh I had to ask for them to bring salt and pepper to the table btw?? The food took too long considering it was not crowded. This place is a waste of time and money. Should have made something at home which would have been better. Can we please get a reasonable; non-chain restaurant with good food for dinner in Downingtown??? [REVIEW_12] We went on a Wenesday 6/6/18 @ 9:20pm  for endless wings! Everything was normal then we found a folded up receipt in our coke under the ice. I already took two sips into it! I was so shocked that they missed this. Unexceptionable I can't imagine where it came from. The only logical explanation is this is a coke from a customer that left and they folded their receipt and tossed it in their drink. Do Hooters re use their cups without washing it or tossing whatever was in it? I brought this up to our server ""savannah"" and she played it off! Stated ""wow that never happens it's usually bugs or something in it"". I don't know what type of explanation or apology that was. If I eat at a restaurant I am expecting clean and delicious food with service; I did not get it at this Hooters. [REVIEW_13] DO NOT shop there! Driver decided to drive off with out fridge- after 4 hours on the phone resolution was a 10% coupon and delivery... In 4 days!! Worst experience ever! Unprofessional and rude! Would never shop there again. Beware!! [REVIEW_14] My husband picked up 2 acai bowls for me and our 2 year old son at the West Nashville location. My bowl was great; but I'm thankful my son did not eat his. I ate his bowl for breakfast the following morning and it had 3 huge pieces of plastic in it! It was disgusting and very dangerous if my son had eaten that. I contacted The Urban Juicer to tell about our experience. Their head of HR emailed me back within 24 hours apologizing; saying she already contacted the store to ensure it wouldn't happen again; and said the CEO would issue me a refund and a $10 gift certificate. It's been over a week and I have not received a refund or gift certificate. I sent a follow-up email this morning; but still have yet to hear back. I'm bummed about this entire experience because I loved Urban Juicer...but this experience was disgusting; dangerous; and handled poorly by management. [REVIEW_15] I knew what I was signing up for but first warning sign: cockroach in my bed. Then the fridge started leaking water everywhere until it just died. THEN after calling the front desk to extend our checkout time; some rude hood lady came banging on the door saying she was gonna call the cops. I would've been fine if they charged us an extra day. Customer service is not their strong point. But it makes sense since all they deal with are crackheads here. ""Under new management""? You need NEWER management. [REVIEW_16] This was so disappointing. I love Chick fil A. My son even works at the Avon location; which is fabulous. This is not the same. I tried to order my usual; that I get several times a week in Avon; and they received to accommodate. I only wanted the bread from the mini rolls. Go to Avon; very close and such a wonderful place to eat. [REVIEW_17] So good. Real Mexico City style. Alambres are amazing and few Mexican restaurants have them. Very authentic. My new favorite place in Santa Barbara! [REVIEW_18] came here for good reviews. sorry but was not happy with my cut. not faded.i always say if they don't do a good fade; haircut is a shame. 2 minute massage. didn't last long enough.  never coming back [REVIEW_19] Visited New Orleans for the end of Mardi Gras and stumbled upon this little cafe for breakfast. Ended up coming back the next two days because the food is absolutely incredible. They serve breakfast and lunch and between everyone we tried a decent portion of their menu. The boudin omelette is amazing along with the Bourbon Street Breakfast which comes with a shot of bourbon! The entire staff is great; especially our server Joe. The whole place just makes you feel like you're eating a great meal at a friend's house. I would recommend this place to ANYONE visiting NOLA who's looking for a delicious and affordable meal. I will for sure make this place a required stop on all future visits. [REVIEW_20] My bridesmaids booked this for my bachelorette party and it was so much fun!! We made really good friends with the other groups in our tour; played trivia; learned about Nashville's history; and got a little buzzed! Dave was an awesome tour guide; he's quirky and knowledgable and really opens up if you joke around with him :) plus he have me a bride cowboy hat with a veil and temporary tattoos for all of us which was a fun twist! Definitely a unique spin on day drinking! [REVIEW_21] If I could give this place negative 5 stars I would. Absolutely the worst steakhouse in Philadelphia. My medium rare steak came out wrong 3 times; and when I asked for the manager he told me it was my fault. I would never come here again. [REVIEW_22] Without a doubt Jimboy's has the best ground beef deep fried tacos in all of Reno.  The are pack full of beef and cheese and talk about a crisp crunch when you bit into them!  Just amazing......   For under $6 you can get two good size tacos and a drink; it's a great lunch value!!!!!!!!! [REVIEW_23] This place is great! The food is fast and fresh and their burritos are on point. They even have a kids menu. All of their dishes are extremely customizable so you can get your food just the way you want it. Very nice for a counter service restaurant. [REVIEW_24] Went here last night. Giving it a 5because our waiter Colton was superb. Everyone from the hostess to the guy that seated us was very nice. The food is still very good. Great job 5 Star!! [REVIEW_25] I'm sure the food is great - it's too bad I didn't have a chance to try it. The service was probably one of the worst that I've ever received; which is too bad because it seemed pretty nice otherwise.  I arrived with my fiancé and the place was full so we were asked to wait by the entrance. No problem. A small table opened up after about 10 min; and instead of taking us to the table; the waitress led us to the bar. I usually don't like sitting at the bar because I'm short; and this bar was exceptionally tall. When sitting; the countertop came above my chest and I wasn't able to rest my arms comfortably. Who wants to eat like that? We requested to be seated at the table that was just cleared; and she informed us that she wanted to give that table to the family behind us with a child. Okay; fine; I understand that children can't sit at the bar; so we agreed to let them have the table. We let the waitress at the bar know that we wanted to move to the next available table and she said sure; no issue. Another waitress comes by to take our order; we explain our situation; and she comments that if we want to wait for a table; we shouldn't be sitting at the bar; like it's our fault for being at the bar in the first place. She did acknowledge at least that there were plenty of open bar seats at the time; so it was ok for us to sit there ""for now"". After another 5 minutes; the first waitress comes over and asks us again ""Are you sure you don't want to sit at the bar? If you move to the table you will have to wait longer for the food to come out."" At this point; I'm frustrated but I've already invested some time. We tell her (again) that we do not want to sit at the bar; but if waiting for the food is an issue; then can we order now please? They take our order; and after another 10 minutes; we see another open up. Not unreasonably; we thought that would be our table... Until we see the same waitress gesturing to another party waiting at the entrance; letting them know that will be their table. She comes over and tells us that she had already promised that table to them; and asks us again if we're sure we don't want to sit at the bar. At this point; we were so fed up that we just walked out.  I thought that we had been plenty understanding and even let that family go ahead of us; but they were just completely taking advantage of our patience and niceness. If this is how you treat your customers; I don't care how good your food tastes. I'd give this place 0 stars if I could. [REVIEW_26] This service does not deliver. We paid for round trip service in advance from the airport to our hotel and from the hotel back to the airport 4 days later.  The limo did not show up as promised on the return trip.  After waiting 20 minutes; we took a taxi to avoid missing our flight.  After returning home we called to get a refund for the service back to the airport.  We were rudely accused of not waiting for the limo (despite needing to catch a flight).  She said she would have to talk to the manager.  We never heard back form them and have filed a complaint with the credit card company to acquire the refund.  DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE! [REVIEW_27] Frost is worth all 5 stars!  I had driven by Frost so many times as I play soccer frequently at Udall Park.   I finally made my way in and as impressed with the overal appeal of the store.  The case that they display all their selections is over the top but beautiful.  I couldn't take my eyes off of everything and wanted to try everything.  Well I stuck to my favs and had a Banana Chocolate combination and it was so good!  The kids really loved it as well.  Its also affordable and the kids that work here are so friendly and helpful!   Must go! [REVIEW_28] Okay I JUST got here and am extremely unimpressed. As I type this I'm sitting in the lobby waiting for our room to be cleaned because it wasn't ready for check in time. Our check in time was 3 o'clock (which is already late as it is); and when we got to our room; the place was AN ABSOLUTE MESS. The bedsheets and pillows were thrown on the floor; there were beach towels (not belonging to the hotel) lying around; and KFC food on the table. It was as if someone had just left.  Aside from that; the people at the front desk could really care less. When we went up to go talk to them; they didn't even apologize. All they said was to wait HALF AN HOUR for the room to be cleaned. AND they offered us another room... A smaller one. For the same ridiculously priced rate.  Primarily upset with the lack of hospitality; not so much for the clean room. People make mistakes; which is understandable. But the way they handled the situation was terrible and I'm definitely not coming back here.  **update it's been over thirty minutes and I'm still waiting for a room. [REVIEW_29] I went to Spasso the other night with some friends. All four of us were SO pleased with our experience and our meals! We each had something different. I had the special for the evening; which was seafood (jumbo shrimp and jumbo lump crab) over pappardelle with tomato and asparagus. it was to die for; and my leftovers the next day were just as tasty :) service was amazing and wine was perfect. I live on state street and can't wait to visit again very soon!! [REVIEW_30] So disappointing. Stopped by for the first time Friday night.  There were 3 people at the bar. The rest of the place was empty.  Sat down; no acknowledgement from the staff.  Went up to the bar and took a menu; still no acknowledgement from the staff.  The guy behind the bar walked right past us to get a bottle of wine for the people at the bar; still no acknowledgement.  Finally after 15 minutes of being invisible; we walked out; and still no acknowledgement. We are new to the neighborhood and are wine drinkers.  We really wanted this to be our new hangout. However; we will look for a place that wants to provide service; where we are happy to spend our money.",12
31,"[REVIEW_1] I have walked by this restaurant countless times; so sweetheart and I finally ventured in.  First observation was that only 2 small tables were full when we arrived; yet I needed a haircut by the time our food arrived.  Second; I ordered a mild chicken dish (which was down-right bland); and sweetheart ordered a spicy seafood dish; which was absolutely ridiculously hot.  I do not exaggerate when I say that 1/3 red hot chili peppers.  Virtually inedible!  This restaurant is clearly a horror; living off of the tourists.  No Philly dweller would frequent this place. [REVIEW_2] If I could select less than one star I would. Completely awful. After calling multiple times and no one answering; I finally was able to talk to a very unhelpful employee. He emailed me a specific unit; price; move in date and application. I filled out the paperwork but was unable to find the specific unit he indicated. When trying to call about my problem no one answered for 2 full business days. Then when talking with another very unhelpful employee; she told me that unit was already gone & suggested other units more expensive & not in the move in date discussed. When asking if they would honor the price originally discussed in email correspondence; they would not. Long story shorter; I cancelled my application & just wasted $50. This business only cares about money & does not care about the tenants at all. [REVIEW_3] Ok yeah; the service can be a little high falutin'; and the wait is painful but this is THE BEST BURGER EVER.  That's all you need to know.  The BEST. [REVIEW_4] My husband and I stopped here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon around 2-ish.  The restaurant was completely empty.  We inquired if they were even open and a nice lady said they were and proceeded to seat us.   Their menu did not offer as many options of meat types or dishes as most Mexican restaurants do here in Indianapolis.  My husband ordered a margarita and the special of the day; Chilaquilles con salsa verde y pollo at $6.99 and I ordered a carne asada burrito at $7.99 and water to drink. Chips and salsa were brought to the table.  Chips were  fried there; and while I like that style of chip (thin; often bubbles into thin layers) but were cold and very greasy.  Salsa was sweet but had some heat in the finish.  It was easy to eat a lot of those! When our meals came to the table; frankly; they were underwhelming.  My burrito tortilla looked/felt like it was not heated at all and cutting into my burrito was disappointing.  There was lots of lettuce and tomato; a scoop of a white rice (not spanish rice) and there was supposed to be mozzarella cheese in it but couldn't taste or see it.  The carne asada was thinner than a strip of bacon.  Unfortunately; I would be generous in saying there was maybe 2 ounces of beef.  In all honesty; there was no more meat in it than two strips of bacon; diced.  My husband mentioned it to the person (owner) with a quick ""sorry"" muttered and no offer to do anything.   While the combination of ingredients was not improperly prepared; there are 100 other Mexican restaurants in town I can spend $8.00 on a burrito and it would be generously filled with meat. As for my husband's chilaquilles; I order this all the time from Biscuits in Broad Ripple and this was another disappointment.  This was chips; salsa verde; one fried egg and a very thin boneless piece of grilled chicken.  My husband felt as I did.  Not poorly prepared but completely lacking any substance.  During the time we spent in this restaurant; there was not one other customer coming or going.  With the lack of substance to the food; I suspect most people will feel as I did and would not waste their time coming back here.  There is no way this restaurant can survive when prices are the same as other Mexican restaurants but quality is far less.  Sadly; I was even mad that we spent $25.00 at this place and left just to drive to a fast food restaurant so we could get some quick; cheap protein.   I will chalk this up to a learning experience.  Folks; save your money and go to Rosita's or Margaritas U.S. 31; Leonardo's or even El Meson. [REVIEW_5] Went on the Cupcake and Macaroon Tour last weekend.  We went to four places.  The first business was a glorified coffee shop.  No cupcakes or macaroons. We were given half of a ricotta cookie.  Although delicious; it was not a cupcake or macaroon.  The second place gave us a quarter of a cupcake. They did not have enough of each flavor; so when it was my turn; the one I wanted was gone. The third establishment was so awful; they should have paid me to try their sample.  It was a vegan bakery free of gluten; dairy; nut; soy; egg and any other allergen one can think of.  I am sensitive to people with food allergies as my husband has them; but I'm not sure why this establishment was included.  How can a cupcake taste good after you've removed all of the key ingredients?  The last place we went to was the one that was supposed to have macaroons.  We were told they ""ran out"" and instead received a quarter of a defrosted mediocre cupcake.  How do I know it had been frozen and not fresh?  It was still partially frozen in the center!  Luckily; it was a beautiful day to be outside; because this tour left a lot to be desired. [REVIEW_6] OK; I'm going to be Debbie Downer.  Awful coffee. Just awful.  Maybe that's not fair. I have yet to sample all of their fare; and perhaps it's a bad idea to fit them into the mold that Mugshots (which was gone before I arrived in Manayunk) occupied. But in the end; they call themselves a cafe; which translates into a coffee shop; moved into the location of a former coffee shop and they include baked goods and coffee on the menu; so I feel comfortable in holding them to some standard.  They were out of their banana bread. All of it. For all the flavors they described; they didn't have a single one left when I arrived. This is a significant portion of their menu; and they were out of all of it; which tells me that they have problems with keeping things in stock They had plenty of Baklava; but I'm allergic to two of the nuts they use in them; so even experimenting is a horrible idea.  There was a small child running around screaming; and I could hear arguing breaking out as I stepped through the door with my coffee. I'm not saying that without empathy; but that is never something you want your customers getting to be a part of. Even if the food had been perfect; it would have detracted from the experience  And...the coffee...I have to  go back to that. I really do. If I has handed a mug of Starbucks and was told that someone had urinated in it; and my only other option was what I had here...I would seriously have to debate that decision. This is a horrible thing to say. It's cruel; and cruel honestly isn't that much more helpful than well meaning lies. It's even more horrible to look at in the cold light of day; and determine that it's still a correct assessment. But this is someone who; during his broke college days; would drink coffee through day old grounds. Someone who used an abandoned French press that was held together with duct tape; and I couldn't finish it. Seriously; it was that bad. I don't know how they did it; and that cup was an accomplishment in of itself.  Maybe the owners are nice folk. Maybe; their Mediterranean food is really good; as other reviews seem to indicate. But they sure as shit ain't a cafe. If they want to be cheery; and have great falafel; they should do that. But dear God in heaven; who I have forsaken in so many ways; they put something on the menu so bad I am still  shocked. Combined with a lack of stock and that atmosphere; I can't possibly give this place a good rating. [REVIEW_7] although i live a stones throw away and love the concept; i can no longer support this establishment. the food is just too inconsistent and despite the reasonable prices; subpar quality. i guess its still better than Goldies but Sylvan Park deserves better. [REVIEW_8] Well. It used to be great. But The service has changed.  The last two times we ate there; service was not good at all.  Undercooked fish.  Watery macaroni. Cold onion rings.  Very disappointing.  We stayed away for a few months then tried again.  This time service was poor; prices raised; and smaller portions.  Sorry top hog.  That's it for our group.  Won't be back. [REVIEW_9] When a review is only 1 star; then there really isn't too much to write. The service was inattentive; the cheeseburgers were cooked on the surface of the sun (evidently; based on how charred they were); and there was a large roach that crawled across our table after we were served our food.  A note of warning to waiters: you ARE; in fact; responsible to ensure that the food you serve is a reasonable approximation of how it is ordered; especially if it is visibly cooked less or more than requested of you. [REVIEW_10] This place is just awful. Great atmosphere; but food is just plain bad. I've given it too many tries. Done. [REVIEW_11] Four of us had dinner at the Sockeye Grill this weekend.  Service was terrible.  Super slow.  Salads were warm and tasteless.  Dressing was watered down.   Salmon was excellent.  Nachos were okay. Finger steaks were mushy and drab.   Waitress  knew her beer. The dark lager was excellent.  The lighter beers we had were too warm.   Looks like this restaurant need some fine tuning.  The atmosphere was like a warehouse; more like being in a barn than a restaurant.   Tvs everywhere but the news was on. Huh? How depressing is that?   We won't be back. [REVIEW_12] Make sure you pee before the end of the game. They close bathrooms after the hockey game. [REVIEW_13] One reason why the poor review; the way they handled a news release from the New Orleans Sewage and Water Board. We are not to use water to bathe; brush teeth; drink or rinse food. The Wyndham has many foreign tourists here that may not be able to understand the the Special News Release that was put under everyone's door. I did ask for more water and was handed 2 small bottles. They refused to let me check out early. [REVIEW_14] I called to get a price on getting a flat fixed $35.99WTH! Is this price legal... Smdh in a city where they don't EVEN pay livable wages.... #tragic ..smdh [REVIEW_15] If a customer goes through the trouble of choosing a specific hair style; shares three photographs of someone modeling the exact hairdo; and discusses it at length with the hairdresser; then it should stand to reason that the customer receives that hair style. Not in this case. I must have caught her on a bad day.  Liberty took it upon herself to cut an extra six inches off my curly hair; which I didn't see until the haircut was complete because she had me facing away from the mirror as she worked. When I confronted her about it; she said the girl in the pictures was ""tiny;"" so the hairdo wouldn't look good on me. I regret paying for this abomination; much less leaving a tip. [REVIEW_16] This is hands down the WORST nail salon I have ever been to. It's highly overpriced and my manicure was awful. They filed off my gels instead of scraping; but they weren't careful and they also filed off my skin. I had three bloody fingers on each hand. My nails were uneven-some really thick; some thin; some with bubbles. The gel started peeling off after less than a week. I should have read the reviews before I went!! You are better off doing your nails yourself. [REVIEW_17] Over-priced and poor quality. I bought a 3k couch which took 12 weeks to build from BoConcept in Philly. The couch had structural problems after 3 months! Customer service was very disorganized and communicated very poorly. I would not buy anything from this company again. Horrible support; high prices and poor quality. STAY AWAY! [REVIEW_18] I love love love this place!  I make a point of it to come here every single time I'm in Santa Barbara.  Every time!  I never order smoothies anywhere else as I have a badass blender at home and can make just about any type of smoothie I can dream up (and I do).  But I will go out of my way to pick one up from this place.  I don't know what it is but BB has cast some sort of spell on me.    Ugh; now I'm craving one... [REVIEW_19] Worst restaurant experience ever. First; this place is super cramped! The noise level was atrocious. I don't know why they haven't done anything about this. We could not engage in an enjoyable conversation.  Second; my plate had dried up food on it from the previous guest. I understand that can happen. But nevertheless; yuck! The service was mediocre. Third; the food was loaded with salt. My husband has high blood pressure so this was a major concern to me. I took a few bites but didn't finish and definitely didn't bother to take home. You cannot enjoy the flavor of the food because everything was drowning in salt. Gross. Fourth; our bill was extremely high. This food was definitely over priced for the quality.  The dessert was decent. But the thing that put the final nail in their restaurant coffin; was the Roach that grazed over my high heel on my way out. I wanted to die. Never again!!!!! Don't waste your time or your money and they seriously need to hire an exterminator now!!!!!! [REVIEW_20] Omg! Do not go here for food! I can not stress this enough. I began by ordering a coffee which they did not have brewed. They made a new batch and then informed me that they did not have milk or cream. She later admitted to me that they had milk but it expired a month ago  They proceeded to stir whip cream into my coffee. It was awful and became curd-like within minutes. The pizza was just plain terrible. Cheese wasn't even melted and the dough was still moist. The service was also the worst I've had in Indiana. I literally got a look of disgust when I walked in and the girl was pissed off the entire time I was there. I wouldn't feed my dog from here. Beer only if you come here. [REVIEW_21] When I was with Charter 10 years ago their service was intermittent and customer service was horrendous. I've been a happy customer of AT&T DSL for the last eight years; but was repeatedly approached by Charter stating that they are now the best in the country; their whole network was revamped and that they now have zero issues. I signed up with Charter as of August 1 and the last 4 days were horrendous. The initial tech who was setting up the service was entirely incompetent and was asking ME questions about the router and the modem. The connection was lightning fast for about 2 days. As of yesterday the signal became weak; pages are taking 30-45 seconds to load and sometimes there is no connection at all. I called Charter and spent 15 minutes on hold; then talked to someone who hung up on me and was finally able to schedule a technician to bring a ""signal booster"" to my place. I live in Central St. Louis; not in a rural area; so apparently their ""best in the nation"" network still leaves much to be desired. [REVIEW_22] This is my first time having Snarf's and I have to say it won't be the last. The gluten free bread was amazing and the prime rib was perfectly rare! [REVIEW_23] This place was awful. I went because it was the only place open late at night. Burger and fries were horrible and I got an apple pie which tasted like it came out of a refrigerated box. [REVIEW_24] DO NOT GO THERE . The male waiter was only looking at my 7 year old daughter and I tried to get his attention  away but couldn't; a real creeper. The cook in the back looked in our direction and laughed. Will never go back  . Horrible place. please help to rip those guys a new one. [REVIEW_25] 2 hours I'll never get back. Waited for the food for an hour before the bartender came back and asked if I ordered something I had not. Clearly had not even put my order in. Another hour wait to close my tab. My drink was refilled once in this 2 hour time period. The food was actually good; but wasting 2 hours of my day in an atmosphere (terribly loud at 11am) I couldn't wait to leave was far from pleasant. [REVIEW_26] The service SUCKS!!!!  The food is mediocre; at best;  and definitely not worth a second trip. We ordered flat bread to start 30 min before we ordered apps and entrees. The flatbreads arrived at the same time the apps did. [REVIEW_27] Ordered the Korean tacos made from naa bread and meat was very cheap. More than half the meat was fat. Also very little meat overall. Unfortunately did not like my experience. [REVIEW_28] As you age; your tastes in everything changes. After entering adulthood and the expected tour of duties of the bar scene; you may be fortunate to find some friends who also share the same fear of alcohol and partying as you do. Although I grew up with board games; my friends weren't board game frenzied yet and the ones we played weren't as engaging as the ones we have found with age. Thankfully; it seems like my group of friends have reached an age where sitting around a table with tea/coffee/wine/beer and a good board game is more enjoyable than dreading the morning headache and D.A.D.S after a night of clubbing.  I still play the classics like Rummicub; Life; Cluedo but if you ask some avid board gamers in their mid to late 20's; they might mention games you may never heard of such as 7 Wonders; Suburbia; Love Letter; Dominion; and the ever favorite (but not mine!) Settlers of Catan.  As board gamers; these new breeds of board games are sometimes much more expensive than the games you're used to. Some creep close to $100.00 based on popularity and awards.  An alternative to buying the games is to head on to Table Top Cafe and ""renting"" games for the day. Instead of going to a coffee shop to read a nice book; why not go to a cafe with some friends and play some board games for a spectacular cost of $5.00? This is a great way to try new games before taking the plunge. They even have some tasty pastries; hot teas; coffees and beer too if you like to play and eat. Which is great because this way; you won't smear your grubby fingers on my board set!  Their selection of board games  is quite impressive. I would even say they carry games that trump even River City Games in terms of selection. Like a game you just played? No problem. You can purchase a brand new copy in store! Unfortunately; like most physical retailers; their mark up is about average and the same as River City. But; if you're in a rush to just buy a game right away and don't plan on buying many games off online retailers to save on shipping; this is a great alternative.  Oh; did I also mention I offensively played Cards Against Humanity for a few hours quite loudly and it was perfectly acceptable? That's an OK in my book.  Pro Tip: Book a table in advanced to guarantee your spot!  Pop Up Video Fact: Locally owned and run! [REVIEW_29] This review has more to do with the experience rather than with the food. I am writing this review even before I head to the restaurant for dinner tonight and believe me when I say this; that I would never end up eating here if the majority of the birthday girl's party did not insist on eating at Han Dynasty just because she likes the food.    It takes 2 phone calls and talking to 3 people to get a reservation at this restaurant; that itself is a turn off. The first lady I speak to is flat out rude when I call asking to make a dinner reservation for tonight ""We're all booked for tonight and not giving out any reservations"" she says before hanging up on me. I call back and a second lady answers and I say I need a reservation for 15 people at 9:30 and she asks for how long? WTF??? ""For however long it takes 15 adults to get done with dinner that's how long"" She responds saying they close at 10PM and the lady has no clue what day it is and they are open later on Friday's and finally agrees to give me a reservation.    It is absolutely appalling when people working in the hospitality industry are rude. If you can't be courteous to your guests consider a different profession. I understand you are in the university city area and have to; more often that you like; deal with students but that by no means is an excuse for ill-treating your guests.    If you expect a 20% tip from anyone they expect to be given a good experience right from the time they call you to make a reservation. [REVIEW_30] Really good hamburgers.  Good menu with lots to choose from.  Relaxed atmosphere; good bar; great patio.  Excellent service!!",5
32,"[REVIEW_1] I don't usually give 5 star reviews; but this one is well deserved. I've been coming to Audrey for years and she is hands down the best. Cut; color; style. The best. Like impeccable. She just knows what to do and gets it right every time. I live in Santa Monica and have been to many hair dressers in LA; but no one compares to her. Anyway; just drove to SB to ""get my hair did"" and am SO happy!!! Just had a baby six weeks ago and needed to feel fresh and young again. Now I do :) I love you Audrey!! [REVIEW_2] This place is so cool... I had the brisket and matzah ball ramen which had a flavorful broth and a little spice to it. Then I had the spiked juice of the day which was Asian pear and vodka... They pour healthy shots here so be prepared! [REVIEW_3] Holy cow. This place is amazing!! I went here with a couple friends and we ordered the stuffed olives (unbelievable black olives with this vinaigrette thick tomato sauce); Kale salad; firecracker shrimp (flash fried and so delicious and juicy); 2 Fettuccine Pomodoros and zucchini spaghetti with veggies. All were absolutely delicious! Accompanied with great wine and great service! It was a night to remember :) [REVIEW_4] I visited the new Paoli location. BIG selection of tasty donuts. It's about time--the cardboard impostors found at Dunkin are so lame compared to these beauties. Salted Caramel; Bacon Maple; Lemon--now you're talking my language. Breakfast sandwiches; muffins; and bagels; oh my. [REVIEW_5] Farm to table done right! Glad Dandelion was packed so we discovered this. The food was very flavorful; the fresh ingredients really popped. We had Saturday brunch; will definitely return to try the regular menu. [REVIEW_6] What can I say?  I'm a sucker for new american.  The owner is a very nice gentleman who really enjoys food.    The service was impeccable and the food was Ridiculously good.  We ordered a mixed berry waffle; huevo rancho; traditional breakfast bagel with grits; and best sandwich with fresh fruits.    I highly recommend the huevo rancho and best sandwich.  The grits was very good as well.   If you decide to visit this restaurant; say hi to the owner.  He's a great guy. [REVIEW_7] Definitely recommend the Three Cup Chicken; Cumin Lamb; and Dan Dan Noodles.  Good to eat in or take-out (but unlimited rice if you eat in!). [REVIEW_8] The Blind Tiger is tucked in near some antique shops in Ybor City; unassuming to the eye walking by it save its awesome sign (of a blind tiger; of course) painted on the window. The interior is warm and inviting and the focus is on coffee; tea; and fresh baked goods with some clothing and homewares also for sale. What really impressed me however was that there is as much emphasis on the tea as the coffee: too often at coffeehouses tea is simply an afterthought and nothing more. Not here. There are about six selections of tea and they roughly cover the gamut of black; oolong; and green teas you'd hope to find. The coffee I had was very good and the baked goods include such favorites as banana bread; cakes; and cinnamon rolls--the latter apparently being what Blind Tiger is most known for locally.   Overall it's a very neat little place and the interior is one which makes you feel no expense was spared to create a haven from the loudness and bustle of Ybor City; where it seems every other business is a bar or club. As much as I love bars; it's great to have a place that provides a degree of quiet and serenity. [REVIEW_9] I spent two years in Philadelphia for graduate school and Tria was by far my favorite place in the whole city!  I strongly suggest getting one of their membership cards; which offers rewards for frequenting the establishment (such as a $50 gift card).   Tria has a great happy hour (5-7) which offers different lists of wine; beer; and cheese at discounted prices. My friends and I always ordered food from there menu and we loved EVERYTHING! I especially love the asparagus salad with white beans; beets with feta cheese; and their lavender pistachio honey drizzled bruschetta.  Their lemon square dessert is amazing as well!   Their menu does change seasonally throughout the year; which I think is nice.  Their variety of wine; beer; and food offers guests a chance to try new items every visit.  You cannot get reservations at Tria; but they have a decent turn over for smaller groups.  It is more difficult to go with a large group of people; but if you are willing to split up into smaller groups it is well-worth the wait! [REVIEW_10] Highly; highly overrated.  The food was a C minus at best.  And the service was so bad that I may never go back.  They screwed up my order completely and my no apologies.  There are a lot of other options around State Street.  Avoid this place like the plague. [REVIEW_11] oh.  my.  god.  i went here for south street's ""restaurant week"" (3 courses; 30$) last weekend and it was amazing.  And that should say a lot considering that a lot of restaurants use restaurant weeks to half-assedly  crank out dishes for the masses in an assembly-line manner.    But not here.  every dish was excellent; and even artistic!  I had the avocado ceviche; barbacoa (perfectly cooked); and chocolate souffle cake with cajeta ice cream.  We also ordered the custom-made guacomole for the table; a server came out and made it for us right at the table. And just as swiftly as he had made it; the four of us devoured it.  SO good.  And the waitress was super-attentive and more than willing to offer recommendations.  On top of everything; the place has a very cool atmosphere and is on a stretch of south street which is very pretty; especially on a temperate spring/summer night--perfect for a little post-dinner stroll or if you're en route to some bar hopping later.  Try this place--you won't regret it. [REVIEW_12] I've been here several times and my cat Toothless is under one of their Wellness Plans. The vet techs and vets are always very nice and helpful when it comes to checking her in; and unless there's a difficult case ahead of me; the check in is always quick and easy. They're also very good about contacting me when someone new or a potential problem comes up; and they call if they need to run any other checks. The price is a little much which is an issue with any vet that I've noticed; but they always treat Toothless very well and I've never had any problems with them. [REVIEW_13] This place has phenomenal food from start to finish. The brussel sprouts were so savory; we ordered two helpings. We also had two of the chicken tacos; and two of the braised short ribs. For dessert; I believe we had something chocolate; and definitely delicious. We actually went to this place back in April but as I'm sitting in another restaurant telling my friend about our experience at this place; I thought I should write them a review since it was so worthy! [REVIEW_14] This is easily one of my favorite spots in Reno. The food is always fresh tasting and the blend of spices even on the salad and vegetables is superb. A must try. [REVIEW_15] My first time coming here was super awesome. So I decide to bring my Mom for my second visit. Unfortunately I was so disappointed and mad that I took my mom here for lunch. We waited for about an hour for our food and they even manage to messed it up.  Might come back for the drinks but not for the food. [REVIEW_16] My sister and I had a great time! Highly recommend this tour. The tour was educational in a fun way and would go again. The tour guide Shawn (I don't know if that's the correct spelling) was awesome. Also; for the money in relation to wine tours this is by far the best deal in town. [REVIEW_17] Burgers are large and tasty. Staff are courteous and friendly. I would definitely come here instead of Bobby's or Shakeshack. Unfortunately; I currently don't live in Philly and will have to wait until next time to try out the rest of the menu.   Just a heads up; my burger got a bit messy to eat; but it was worth it. Get Ziggy with it... [REVIEW_18] I never ever post reviews but this place definitely wowed me. The ac in my car was out and after being priced from other competitors in the 1300-1800 dollar range i came to midas. Not only did the fix it for about 500 bucks cheaper; but they refused to let me take a taxi and one of the mechanics gave me a ride home while I wait for the work to be done. The manager Blake was very professional and helpful. Not once did i feel he was trying to upcharge me for maintenance i didn't need. Someone from corporate needs to give this man a raise so he stays in the company for a very long time! [REVIEW_19] Best wings in Indy. Get the signature sauce. Both locations have great atmosphere with awesome wait staff. [REVIEW_20] Best wings ever! On vacation in Tucson and had a recommendation to try the wings here. They are so good; I can't wait to go back. The sauces were unique and awesome. [REVIEW_21] We were thoroughly impressed with this hotel! Upon arriving; you are immediately welcomed with the scent of fresh baked cookies. Walking up to the desk we were greeted by Valorie who informed us that cookies and water were complementary to guests and that we were more than welcome. Across from the desk we noticed a book shelf. This is not the kind of book shelf where rejected leftovers were placed but rather; a wide range of books by well known authors. The name of the program was called Read it and Return. In essence; you can borrow a book for the duration of your stay and if you don't finish it you can return it the next time you stay at the hotel at any of the Carlson hotels who have the same program! ( what!?! Cookies and books!?! YES!) Right off the bat; we felt like we were right at home.     Arriving at our room; we noticed that everything was extremely clean and there was a refrigerator (with a small freezer) ; a microwave; a coffee maker; and a well working A.C. (you know; the kind that you don't have to yell over to have a conversation). The bathroom was stocked with brand name shampoo; conditioner; and lotion.    Our next stop was the smoking area. Normally; smokers feel as though they have been marooned to a small place behind the dumpster...but not here! Provided was 2 sets of swinging benches; set far enough away so that it did not disturb the guests in rooms around the area but no a 10 mile hike for those adults who enjoy the pleasure. Did I also mention they have smoking rooms available?  In the morning; feel free to partake in a complimentary breakfast (NOT CONTINENTAL)-I mean a real breakfast which changes daily; anything from fresh made waffles to eggs; sausage; and bacon! Also; cold cereal; juices; and coffees have options! Coffee is available 24/7 as well!   The hotel also has a pool and hot tub which I personally observed them clean daily!  On our last night we got back late and I was going to ask the desk for a late check out; but there was no need! Their check out time is 12:00 Pm as opposed to the hotel usual of 11:00 Am. That worked out well for us.  At checkout we were asked if there was anything we would change about the hotel or our stay. I made small suggestions which I thought would help them; but definitely nothing major. The desk person wrote down what I said and said she would pass it on! I was impressed with that; because we've been asked about our stay at other places; but it seemed more out of routine than actual interest. Here; she seemed genuinely interested. We don't usually do reviews; so I'm sorry for the long review. However; we wanted you to get a real feel for this wonderful hotel and hope that you enjoy it as much as we did! Thanks for reading and safe travels. J & Niki. [REVIEW_22] I had been wanting to go here since it opened and I finally made it! Thankfully; yelp has the new handy reservation feature and I was able to make a reservation from the app just 30 min from when I looked. That gave me enough time to jump in the car and make it for my reservation! So simple and super useful on a Saturday night!  First off; the modern decor inside the historical building makes for lots of easy conversation. There are some really cool; old city planning maps and trendy butcher block table tops. I loved everything about it!   I also loved that when I sat down; some very delicious cornbread fritters were delivered. They are so tasty and have the perfect amount of jalapeño kick balanced with a bourbon honey sauce.   The cocktail menu is definitely worth making a couple visits for. I got an Albee's Knees and it was the bees knees! I'm not usually a fan of gin; but this cocktail was delicious!  We ordered an Artichoke; Cheese and Kale dip appetizer. It was heavenly! I would go back exclusively for the dip! It was served with fresh pita and was a great appetizer.   I couldn't decide what to order for dinner; but landed on the shrimp tacos and was happy with my decision! The corn tortillas were very crispy; almost tostada like and the spicy slaw and cojita was perfect! I would definitely order them again.  I was too full to try any dessert; so I'm going to have to come back! The Mac and cheese bites are also calling to me; so it won't be long! [REVIEW_23] Amazing place for wings in Tucson. Go here about twice a month to get wings with my staff. Great little hole in the wall Wing Place. [REVIEW_24] I stumbled on this for breakfast. I had a Backyard Bowl - yummy. The large is pretty big. The granola in it was fabulous crunchy but not overly sweet. It's great to find a restaurant that serves up organic foods. Tomorrow I'm going to try the Island bowl.  Pricing is about $6-7 but worth it --- better than eating pancakes. [REVIEW_25] I went to Twisted Tail with my father. We were definitely not disappointed. We got the 4-course meal and loved every part of it. The specialty grill they used brought out some interesting flavors. The service was very good and attentive to our orders. The atmosphere was fun and different compared to the modern scene I've seen in many other restaurants in the city. I will definitely be coming back to this neighborhood treat. [REVIEW_26] Amy; the owner and instructor; is awesone!!  The instructions she delivers are great for beginners and those with experience alike.  I'm going back again next week! [REVIEW_27] Fast. Tasty. There were 3 parties in line before me. Line moved fast. Got the nachos for carryout. You can get the chips separate in a bag to keep them from getting too soggy. I like the toppings on the chips; even for carryout.   Nacho chips. Black beans. Queso. Sour cream. Pico. Corn salsa.  Guac. So delicious!  They were really generous with the chips and toppings!  A great dinner!  You can also get pinto beans. Meat. Shredded cheese. Lettuce. And the more spicy queso and salsa.   I also like their ancho BBQ chicken burrito but it's pretty hefty.   Solid meal. About $8. They have a frequent diner card too. I think about 10 meals and the next one is free.   Bonus- they have the fancy coke machine where you can make any flavor possible!  Restaurant is clean. Get your own utensils and napkins. All employees were very friendly. [REVIEW_28] Sabrinas in collingswood is a welcome sight.   Seated in the former Woolworth building; is the newest restaurant.   Large open spacing with communal tabling add to the charm of what is collingswood.     We both had the huevos Rancheros accompanied by glorious bacon and sounds of the 50s; 60s; 70s doo wop (think the Archies' ""sugar sugar""; jimmy soul etc).   Overall;  food and coffee along with vibes ate everything you've come to expect from sabrinas and more.   Can't wait for their brunch specials either. [REVIEW_29] Amazing! Late night arrival in NOLA so got amazing service from Gary! Food was amazing. Highly recommend the seafood platter! Highest quality and freshness... [REVIEW_30] The donuts are inventive and delicious.  I had a bacon maple donut on my birthday that made my day.  the koloches are amazing.  The lattes are always perfect and do not require any sugar.  There is so much more that District Donuts has to offer that I'll have to keep coming back to try other things on their menu.  However; thus far; I get to the counter and cave for donuts/kolaches every time.",28
33,"[REVIEW_1] Stayed at the Holiday Inn while on vacation; and thought we would give it a try this place is beautiful! Right on water; big and lots to see. Live music was great! I expected great food to come out and what I got was frozen seafood!!! Ordered the calamari- looked great but tasted like frozen fried with no season at all!! Kids got chicken fingers and a burger which also taste frozen and the burger no joke tasted just like a frozen bubba burger you get from the store. Also got the Mango Mai Mai; this I thought for sure would be good but again the fresh was rubbery; over cooked tasted frozen; the baked potato tasted to be old. When it came time to pay; i have my server a $100 bill she brings me back change for a $50! Not cool at all! In all honesty the only thing this place is good for is drinks. I'm very disappointed in it ! I should have saved the money and walked over to Crabby Bills! [REVIEW_2] DON'T GO HERE FOR UBER. I have had the WORST buying experience of my life here. I walked into this dealership for the first time around the end of June. The sales people seemed helpful and answered my questions at first. I even came back a couple times before I made a decision on the car. On saturday July 2nd I made the deposit and was promised a car the following friday (July 8) latest. I patiently waited checking back a couple times throughout the week to get updates on the situation to make sure everything went smoothly. Not only was it extremely time consuming because they just didn't wanna help you out until your presence became an annoyance to them; they also kept lying to get me to leave; giving me deadlines they never met. They constantly told me that they would call me back and let me know but they never did. Today 12 days have past; and they still did not give me a proper response regarding the fate of the promised car. Today someone actually picked up the phone and after giving me a very unclear response about the fate of the car shut down the phone without letting me respond. Very rude. Who is going to reimburse me 9 days (taking out 3 days that they initially promised to deliver) of not being able to work? On average I lost more than a $1000 already by not being able to work and I still don't know what will happen. Forget about the money; the negative attitude and treatment you will receive here is not worth any money in the world. [REVIEW_3] Echoing other reviews; Birchtree was professional; responsive; delicious; and willing and happy to work with and contribute to our very particular vision for a localgreenDIY backyard wedding; which went off without a hitch.  I have zero misgivings about our experience with them; in fact they went well above and beyond; rescuing us from a bit of our own chaos; and I am happy to enthusiastically and glowingly recommend them! [REVIEW_4] I'll start this off by saying I've worked in the food industry as a server; bartender; expo; busser; dishwasher; etc for 10 plus years. I now work with disabled persons trying to help them find employment. We're not supposed to meet them in their home as per company policy. My client; who is disabled; and I have visited this pizzeria a few times per her request because it's close to her house and she feels comfortable meeting there. Today we went in at 1:45pm and I noticed it was busier than usual (typically we go at a time where it is not busy restaurant hours.) Before going to sit down like we normally do; and again this was only our third time here; We were greeted aggressively and immediately by who I assume is the owner. I started to ask ""do you mind if we sit here.."" and was cut off. He said; ""I have a real problem with you coming in here not buying anything and sitting taking up a table for 2-3 hours."" (Mind you; we have never been there the previous 2 times over an hour and 15 minutes - as I have a limited amount of time I am able to work with each client.  There also has been about 15 other open tables in the restaurant each time we were there; including today.) This person responded very hostile and aggressive. Had the gentleman asked politely if I purchased a drink or a slice of pizza we could sit and go about our business; however he met me with an extremely volatile attitude and aggressive choice of words. Again; as someone who's worked in the food industry; I understand how it can be frustrating for someone to come in and sit without purchasing anything. With that said; how this employee decided to treat me in this moment made me and my disabled client extremely uncomfortable. The rudeness was completely unnecessary and being familiar with the industry I wouldn't have minded at all purchasing something from this place in order to sit there for an hour; had I been spoken to appropriately. The part I feel the worst about is how my client was treated. I had to explain to her why ""that man was so rude"". It's unacceptable how me and my client were made to feel today. She's already treated differently in the world and she felt terrible after this interaction. I'm mortified that this had to happen in this way; and this whole situation could have been completely avoided had we been treated like human beings. What the employee was trying to say was completely justified; however we were yelled at and made to feel like we were unwelcome for no reason whatsoever. I will not be entering this restaurant again for obvious reasons; and I encourage anyone who has any empathy for disabled persons to do the same. Again; the way we were treated was completely reprehensible and could have been avoided completely. [REVIEW_5] Disaster! Avoid! Restaurant is extremely dated & service poor. Food is mediocre a best. Chicken parm was dark brown around edges & sauce had a weird after taste; almost like it had come from a can/tin. Instead of spaghetti; I had penne. Penne was terrible; pretty much crunchy with same strange tasting sauce as chicken parm. Would never go back! Avoid this place!! [REVIEW_6] My husband and I decided to finally try Picca's on a Thursday night. We arrived around 7pm. We were told there was a 15-20 minute wait. However there were tons of tables open; but okay. I have a background in the biz so I understand sometimes there may be things behind the scenes like short staffed or doubling seating servers; etc. We waited 15 minutes and were sat. The ambience in this place reminds me of the inside of a Pizza Hut sit down restaurant when they used to have the buffets. Not too impressed. The menu also reminds me of a chain-like Italian wannabe. Nothing special or innovative. Yawn. Our server was friendly and took our drink order. She dropped the drinks off and said she would be right with us. We drank our drinks and waited... And waited... And waited... No sign of her! I looked at my watch. It was going on 8pm.  35 minutes and she never came to take our order. We left some cash for the drinks and headed to another restaurant...one we felt confident would be a better experience.  Can't tell you how the food was; but it is safe to say we will never go back. [REVIEW_7] AMAZING! The shrimp 4 way platter was SO GOOD! All 4 ways delicious but my fave was the coconut shrimp. I'm already addicted to the coconut rice. The service was fabulous! Josh did a great job! We went yesterday for lunch and plan on going back tonight for dinner. I can't wait to try something new and the key lime pie! Award winning!! Yum! [REVIEW_8] Thought we would try this place out for a quick bite with the kids. The food was terrible; even the kids burger which was about half the size of the bun (didn't think you could mess up a kid burger). I had the crab cake pasta which was bland and full of crab shells. My husband had the white beans which were not yo momma's for sure. [REVIEW_9] I discovered this bakery through yelp; and everyone was on point....the sweet bread from this panaderia is divine!!! The actual bakery is clean; bright; and festive...pi~natas hanging from the ceiling..it is right next to an ethinic market too. It is marveous to find such a cute mexican bakery in Nashville with courteous staff. My friend and I were going bonkers while picking our bread....they had salvadorean quesadillas!! [REVIEW_10] Stopped in for dinner alone while taking a break from work.  Ordered wings for an appitizer and fish tacos for an entree.  The wings were over cooked and very difficult to eat.  The fish tacos were good.  The prices are thoroughly unreasonable; especially for the atmosphere and quality of food.  Frankly; don't really know how they're so busy.   Would not return. [REVIEW_11] Ultimate man cave for Sunday football games. Gets a little crowded but this is the place to be. Freezing beer and great food [REVIEW_12] I would give this place zero stars if I could. The bouncer told me I couldn't leave until I gave him a ""little somethin somethin"" and took away my friend's legal ID. When we asked for it back; he said he wouldn't give it back until the cops came. What a fucking joke. Save your self esteems and your personal property and go somewhere else. [REVIEW_13] We are visiting in Philadelphia from California.  My son took us here for our 28 year wedding anniversary. All the food was delicious and the service was great! Everyone that worked there seemed happy to be there and we're extremely friendly! The pita bread was baked to order and served directly from the oven to the table and was by far; the best I'd had. The hummus; tabbouleh and marinated veggies were all Amazing! The grilled mixed mushrooms and lamb sausage were so flavorful! We didn't have anything that wasn't delicious! If I ever come back to Philly;  I would definitely go back to this place! SO GOOD!! [REVIEW_14] I took my car to have the left headlight replaced; in Oct 2015. the price was reasonable. I had to take my car again in Dec 2015; because the headlight wasn't installed correctly(facing downward) it was fixed (no charge). And then again back to Sears auto Jan 27th because my headlight had gone out! At this point my blood is boiling! Because of employee negligence! Couldn't get it right the 1st time! Although I will say I wasn't charged; not that I would have paid for a headlight that I had already paid for 3 months ago! My headlight on the drivers side was replaced 2 yrs ago and as of today has not been replaced! Smdh.  I will NEVER TAKE MY CAR HERE AGAIN! Stay away!! Small details were overlooked. Needless to say; I didn't get good customer service and it's a good distance from my home; but close to my work. [REVIEW_15] If you are willing to walk 3-4 blocks on the other side of canal... You will not be disappointed! Best place to eat so far!! Highly recommend!!  My husband and I enjoyed it so much that during a 5 day stay; we ate there twice!  Inexpensive dinner- total bill (for 2 people) minus alcohol $50. [REVIEW_16] The margarita tasted like lemonade. It was AWFUL and tasted like it had no tequila in it at all. I asked to either switch it out for something else or for them to remake it and they wouldn't do either. I won't ever be back! Terrible service. [REVIEW_17] Place is dirty; customer service is bad; small portions of food; leaves you hungry and over price. I would not recommend this place at all! Went on 03/15/17 will never go again. [REVIEW_18] We ate in. Awful pizza.  Shared the Philly steak pizza with bacon on the side.  Pizza was oily and soggy with little sauce and no flavor. Got sauce on the side and it was so watery as to be a liability.  Bacon was just heated bacon bits (worst I ever had) with no taste but lots more grease.  We were the ONLY customers eating in the entire time. Only sound was the overloud music.  Waiter was just one of the kitchen workers who was; however; very accommodating when he was available.  If you decide to go; I wish you much better luck.  Rating on pizza = minus 2.5 [REVIEW_19] The local staff don't appear to be keeping truck inventory statuses and availability accurate and relative ""real time"" - pick a business goal like ""updated in the system within x minutes (assess each on a couple key factors; perhaps group similar actions together; and define 2-3 tiers of service expectations in an SLA; based on the service uncertainty/complexity; its ""sensitivity"" analysis based on range of quality level and their relative impact to the customer.  Clearly; what the General Manager is working at or too; with respect to %accuracy and timeliness of updates to the online reservation system. Some examples are: - truck availability update window (15-30 minutes of a change in state; truck location)     (e.g. departed to destination; arrived at destination; cleaned & prepped; in service)  I made my online reservation Friday pickup either the Tuesday or Wednesday morning prior.  Based on the system availability and near ""real time"" electronic inventory data and known schedules for use/return to service; the system offered me the chance to request a  24 foot truck from location A (nearer to my house) at 9:00am on Friday.  A couple hours later; I got my ""confirmation"" telling me I could have a 24 foot truck from location B (twice as far from my house - about 30 minutes). And; the truck would be available at 12:00pm...but we could probably count on 9:00am (but I should call to confirm Friday morning.) If figured this was because the data changed after I made the request... not the case.  It wasn't right to begin with...and never did get updated in a timely manner; causing multiple trips; wasted time and conflicting data/opinions. Not an ""end to end"" customer focused supply chain...IMHO  I had a wasted trip way up north in Indy; and was told blatantly inaccurate information twice - wasting time; destroying trust and credibility from UHaul's perspective...  Eventually a lightbulb turned on.... The ""root cause"" here appears to be the failure of the local Uhaul to either have customer focused SLA's by which they are measured for their role/impact in the ""supply chain.""  OR; they had the SLA's in place...and were consistently not meeting them.  The local staff don't appear to be keeping truck inventory statuses and availability accurate and relative ""real time"" - pick a business goal like ""updated in the system within x minutes (assess each on a couple key factors; perhaps group similar actions together; and define 2-3 tiers of service expectations in an SLA; based on the service uncertainty/complexity; its ""sensitivity"" analysis based on range of quality level and their relative impact to the customer.  Clearly; what the General Manager is working at or too; with respect to %accuracy and timeliness of updates to the online reservation system. Some examples are: - truck availability update window (15-30 minutes of a change in state; truck location)     (e.g. departed to destination; arrived at destination; cleaned & prepped; in service)  If you truly take this to heart; I'd welcome hearing from you more to clarify any misunderstandings; and hear what specific actions you're taking / data you discover to support or challenge my assumptions and conclusions. [REVIEW_20] Great pho and the service was outstanding.  Easy parking too.  Staff enjoys serving and makes you feel welcome.  Food was very good. [REVIEW_21] The catfish; chicken; gumbo and mac &a cheese are all to die for. We are the lunch buffet and everything was piping hot and fresh. This place was recommended by a local in the neighborhood we are staying in and it was so worth it! [REVIEW_22] 3 calls to say when they'd come never happened. Our ""Guaranteed morning appointment"" became ""we'll try to get there in the morning"". Nobody can reach the installers; no management is available on the weekends; ""printing problems have delayed the ability to call customers back"" (actual quote); being told to wait 10 hours on a Saturday isn't convenient; something they touted in their sales process. Salesman **Name Redacted** thank you for ""not being able to do anything"" but being happy to sell the carpet.  (message me if you'd like the salesman's name)  Morning appointment; its 2:21PM currently; no carpet. [REVIEW_23] Wonderful clean eating type cafe. We were looking for some healthier breakfast options and found it here. Smaller place down a side street but very worth it. Excellent quality smoothies and bagels were just so much more flavorful than the chain type places. Highly recommend. [REVIEW_24] This is my ultimate favorite pizza place ever! I have wonderful family memories of going here with my grandmom and the whole family. They have the best pizza ever and very yummy cheese fries. No matter what you get the food is always wonderful! I went to the 60th anniversary celebration recently and it was great fun! I will never tire of this place. It's a great place to go with friends and I always recommend it to new people. I just love it so much. [REVIEW_25] Do NOT use this auto service center! They will tell you one thing on the phone; and when you drive all the way there to get service on your car; they will tell you that they can't have your vehicle done for hours longer than promised over the phone. I recently tried to get my oil changed here; I called first to see if they took reservations and was told that they were walk-in only but if I had my car there by 3:30pm they would have it done by 5:30pm at the latest. So I drove 30 minutes to get there; planning to do some shopping and errands at the surrounding stores while I waited. However when I arrived; the service guys told me they couldn't get it done before 8!!! When I explained that I had called and was told no more than two hours; even showing them my phone to prove I called the right Dobbs; the desk guy basically called me a liar and said no one told me that they could have it done in two hours! Now THATS customer service if I've ever heard it. Needless to say I took my keys and left. I will never bring my business to Dobbs again. [REVIEW_26] The waitstaff were attentive and very nice! That is the only positive comment that I have for this establishment: I waited fir over an hour while moderate celebrities were ushered in. After all of the waiting the food was not good. Grits were hard and not seasoned; shrimp & fish over cooked; it was a disappointment. [REVIEW_27] I just cannot say enough nice things about Dr. Reddy. We were back again today with our itchy Scottish Terrier and there is no high sales pitch for us to buy medications; sprays; creams; etc. Dr. Reddy ONLY recommends what is absolutely necessary for your pet. He takes his time and is super thorough. I would not take my fur babies to anyone else but Seven Oaks Pet Hospital. The staff is also extremely friendly. Thanks Dr. Reddy for always being so kind to your clients. I would like to add a few recommendations. Seven Oaks Pet Hospital offers Unlimited Nail Trimming and Ear Cleaning (6 months) $59.00 -- Great Savings! That is an amazing deal considering my dog loathes getting his nails trimmed. The vet techs are so sweet and make the situation as stress free as possible. Lastly; they offer Wellness Plans for puppies/kittens as well as adult canine/feline. Please either call for a quote or check out their website to gather more information ----. http://sevenoakspet.vetstreet.com/ Can't fathom taking my fur-babies to anyone else. Highly Recommend! [REVIEW_28] Yats is addictive. I have their drunken chicken about once every two weeks but have tried most dishes on the menu. The portions are enormous for a reasonable price; with tender rice and buttered slices of baguette. You will need the bread for mopping up all of that tasty sauce: do not let a drop go to waste. All of their dishes have excellent flavor... And their collection of hot sauces is amazing! Try the Louisiana Lightening for a hot sauce that has some real southern flavor and kick. [REVIEW_29] I moved to Missouri about 3 years ago and it was so hard to find a stylist for my needs. I went through a year of bad hair cuts; color and styling. I decided to challenge any stylist willing to call my stylist back home to get my info. This fantastic sams and stylist was the only one out of at least six that accepted this challenge. Called me super excited and let me know she had my info and was ready for me.. it turned out amazing... like really amazing! I have been coming here ever since. They are friendly and honest; they won't tell you they know how to do something and not really know. Depending on your request they will even tell you which one of them is best at that. Hands down the best hair salon in Missouri! [REVIEW_30] We tried to go here on a Sunday night before a concert.  Got there at 6:30 were on the no wait app.  Said it would be 40 minutes max. We left at 7:40 had not been seated and was told the kitchen was behind.  The last time I was here it took a long time to get our food.  I do not recommend this establishment.",13
34,"[REVIEW_1] Once again;  the Red Habanero team has exceeded our expectations. Our meal tasted fantastic and the presentation was very appealing. We love the 96 street location and have no problmes driving all the way from Greenwood for a visit.  Thank you Red Habanero for another fantastic experience. We will actively see what we can do to help you open another location within Greenwood. [REVIEW_2] Crap. Period. Canned mushrooms on the veal. Oldest Italian restaurant; uh ok. How about good food prepared like nonna used to make not some underpaid immigrant line cook. Disgrace [REVIEW_3] I have lived in 3 majors cities across the US; 2 foreign countries; and although I have only been to PP twice; it is hands down the best pancake I have ever had. Sorry; Mom.  And you don't even have to get the crazy Sweet Potato or Buckwheat stylings to get something special. Just get regular old Buttermilk; they are perfect. They are the pancake ideal.  I was here for the first time about 5 years ago. It was amazing. I just went back for the second time; the memory of my first visit in my mind; and I was just praying it was as good as I'd remembered. It was. [REVIEW_4] This may actually be the worst falafel pita sandwich I have seen in my life. I have eaten a lot of falafel. To pay upwards of five dollars for this is absolute robbery; and they would never get away with it off campus. IV Deli Mart's falafel isn't even that great; but it shines in comparison to this. Do not go here. [REVIEW_5] Loved the atmosphere and the coffee. Pulled off 101 looking for a snack; but when a coffee lover sees a place called french press. ..I had to detour lol. I guess you could call me a pesky customer. I had a lot of questions before I selected which coffee I was buying which were all cheerfully answered. I was intrigued by their cold brew and the batista explained process and taste and offered me a sample. Love the customer service thanks guys!  Between my group I tried 2 blends of coffee; one french pressed one espresso; and the Tres leches coffee which was unique and yummy. I suggest trying it. It's sweet and creamy but not enough to take away from the coffee's flavor.  If I lived in the santa Barbara area; I'd likely become a regular :) [REVIEW_6] Great setting. Food & service did not match the hip bar/restaurant. My friends and I (6 people) had a reservation for brunch on Sunday. We were the only table there and the bar was less than full. It took a very long time to get our drinks. Our server was not attentive. We weren't going to get our bottomless mimosas waiting around for her bc she was sitting & rolling silverware chatting it up with her co-worker. So I took our glasses directly to the  bartender for our refills instead. Food was mediocre at best. I ordered the hot chicken tacos which wasn't spicy at all. My friends ordered the lox; it was fishy and it was more like smoked salmon flakes; no actual slices of smoked salmon. Pricey for what it was. The steak my friend ordered was very salty. A very bad representation of Nashville eateries. I do not recommend going here. [REVIEW_7] Our service wasn't the greatest. They told us it takes 35-40 for a pizza and we were in a little bit of a rush so just ordered appetizers but those took 40 mins to get as well. [REVIEW_8] Service was so poor we didn't even get to the food. New Years Day 2017 around 7:30 and we get seated. It's 8:15 now and we still don't have water and multiple waiters have introduced themselves to us saying they're going to be our server for the evening. After wasting 45 mins and repeated attempts to get water for the largest party in the small restaurant we walked out and went across the street to Dat Dog and were blown away by hot dogs. Thanks Dat Dogs! [REVIEW_9] Two days here at the Eldorado with a group of 25 people. We have experienced the worse customer service . We just finished brunch and we're constantly badgered by our waitress about the number of people in our group. We were taking up too much space. She was a nice as a rattlesnake.  At 17 dollars per person I would think more is better. Food was ok but you will definitely not be welcomed or appreciated.   Yesterday same warm fuzzy feeling at the coffee shop when we spent over 350 dollars and we're treated like castaways.  TAKE YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE. .. NO HOSPITALITY AT ELDORADO [REVIEW_10] I took a cooking class at La Cucina and it was sub-par at best. I learned nothing; since everything that was taught was so elementary; that I already knew the techniques.  Additionally; Anna Florio; the owner; was incredibly rude towards me; as I have a tendency to ask questions....something she doesn't like. [REVIEW_11] Good bagels; but they can NEVER get an order right.  We live in NJ so when you ask for Taylor Ham and cheese you think they would be able to handle this.    Instead I get a ham and cheese sandwich; or an egg; ham and cheese sandwich.  I am DONE with this place.  City Market or Lumberville General Store will be my two choices from here on out. [REVIEW_12] Open 24/7 plenty of equipment never too crowded classes also available the staff is always friendly and willing to help the district manager stops in as well every week to Make sure everything is on the up and up and my membership is good everything! [REVIEW_13] 5 stars all the way!!!  I love how Gianna's has your standard Italian fare yet they also have a veganized menu if you're coming with friends who have different tastes.  By no means am I vegan; but having recently given up dairy for health reasons this is huge for me and it makes it a lot harder for me to eat out and find something half decent; so I will DEFINITELY be back! [REVIEW_14] Don't shop here! The main manager here is a total bitch; I wore a pair of Levi shoes to school for one class; the shoes tore into the back of my heel to the point of bleeding and blistering; I went to return the item and was told I could not; even after explaining that we had asked the return policy BEFORE buying the shoes; to which the employee only told us we had 30 day; which is complete LIE; you have 30 days if they are totally unworn... how are you supposed to tell if the quality of the shoe is okay if you don't ware them? What if the glue peels or they completely fall apart? You are suckered into buying them and then you are told you are completely SOL if the shoe is of very bad quality. The manager needs to be fired; no managerial skills whatsoever; who trained her; Hiter? Again I strongly urge you to buy shoes from a better store! [REVIEW_15] Airport pickup never showed up after an hour and multiple calls. Hotel stopped answering the phone.  Very poorly managed. [REVIEW_16] We walked in with every intention to spend a good amount of money on souvenirs. My husband gave me a kiss in the store and she kicked us out and told us it is a place of business and we need a hotel. Meanwhile she was eating her lunch  at the register and chomping away and didn't even great us. Yikes. Hope they reconsider their tactics. [REVIEW_17] I took my expensive Christian Louboutins here to be dyed since I had heard that this place was one of the best in the city. Boy; what an overstatement. I wanted my studded gray CLs dyed black. I SPECIFICALLY told them to please; please; please be careful not to get any dye on the red soles because that is what makes a Louboutin a Louboutin. I also asked if they could dye it without covering the studs. They told me YES. They would tape off everything that wasn't going to be dyed and it would turn out perfect. I came back a week later; like they told me. Only 1 shoe was half done. So they told me another week.  I came in to pick them up today to find the worst dye job I have ever seen in my life. There was black dye all over the studs; all over the inside and the toe box; and (worst of all) all over the red soles. Besides the damage; all of the gray had not even been dyed. There were random un-dyed patches everywhere. I told them that this was not the kind of work I was promised. Then they changed their story and said that it would have been impossible to tape off the studs. They said I should not have even tried to get them dyed. When I questioned why there is dye on the inside and why the red soles are covered in black dye splotches; they said ""I don't know"". They told me they could TRY to remove the dye but that the red might come off; too. I told them this is completely unacceptable. And then they gave me an attitude. They said ""Look; we already told you we could remove the dye. I don't understand why you keep standing here talking.""  If the job could not be done; they should have told me ahead of time. I understand it was a tedious job; what with all the studs; but there is no excuse for getting dye all over the inside and soles. He said the dye would come off as I walked. ....YOU DON'T WALK ON THE ARCHES OF THE HEELS. I asked for my money back and they told me they dyed my shoes like I asked; so what more do I want. I just took my shoes and left. They must be crazy to think I would leave my shoes there for them to ""fix"".  I instead took them to Superior Shoe Repair near 15th and Walnut. I have taken shoes there before; so I should've went there to begin with because I know they are used to dealing with designer shoes. They said they could fix it; so I will be reviewing them when I pick them up this week. [REVIEW_18] Nice food but don't go to this place when their busy time; such as brunch time:))    After we ordered about half hour; our food still not show up and we ask the server that we waiting long time. You know what; our server told us ""you guys only waited 22 mins."" WHat the hell is that answer supposed to be???!!!!  And we ask separate check the guy said ""we dont do separate check when we are busy."" :)) Well... i dont offer tip when you busy then:)))) Who fking cares!! [REVIEW_19] WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!! Originally ordered rolls to go; asked to double check and they yelled at us for just wanting to make sure if we had all the rolls we ordered. After we left; we found out we were missing not 2 rolls like last time; but 4!! so we called back; asked to speak with the owner. We got on the phone supposedly with their manager; and the manager said he would give us a gift card for next time we came. Don't you think I should get my food that I already paid for? why do I have to wait til next time to get reimbursed for what I should have already gotten. The ""manager"" said the owner wasn't there but later when we asked if we could talk to him; the same ""manager"" turned into the owner. Then the ""Manger/owner"" hung up on us for trying to figure out how to fix the situation. I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN. You do not get all of what you order; and best believe I will let everyone in  the Reno/Sparks area know to not eat at Sushi Minato. Unfriendly; rude; and a big rip off. I only left 1 star because there is no option for no stars. [REVIEW_20] This place is gross.  The bathroom was dirty; with peeling paint and rusting fixtures.  Old AC unit made horrible noises every time it shut off.  The previous guests left some sort of food in the microwave; indicating that it had not been cleaned.  The rates were low; but the Howard Johnson or Motel 6 next door couldn't possibly be worse.  Not worth it; go somewhere else. [REVIEW_21] What a nightmare!  This is a dirty nasty smelly station  paid cash for gas but the pumps all stopped and nobody could finish pumping. The lady the owner who was a witch said they had to reset the pumps. I wish I had not paid cash. I had to wait half an hour to get my remaining cash back. It happened to every pump. Avoid this nasty store at all costs [REVIEW_22] Okay; I'm obsessed with the chocolate pancakes from IHOP but they are not worth it when the service is SHIT. My server comes to the table asked me what I wanted to order for a drink; I ask a few questions about the mimosas. He said ""No just Orange juice and Champagne"" I say then I'll getting something else AND HE WALKED AWAY BEFORE I COULD FINISH MY SENTENCE. I was appalled. This man was older so he had no excuse for his ignorance. I am so disappointed with this establishment. If I could give negative stars I would. Do not go here; it is not worth it. [REVIEW_23] Gave them another try today ... SMDH .... how does this place stay open .... customer service non existent always out of something or something not working ... really don't know how they even stay open .. I would be embarrassed to own this location [REVIEW_24] Made an appointment on line at 12:30 on a Sunday for 2 pm They claim they do same day service. Ride up there and am told ""it's better to call because then they can see if the guys who do diagnostics are in."" They were not there. Really? I posted in the appointment comments what the problem was (why not notify me you can't do the work before I drive there in a car that may brake down) and what mechanic can't run a diagnostic? Doesn't the machine do it for you? Clowns and jokers  Stay away. Lying lumps of crap. [REVIEW_25] If you go here; beware.  If the bar attended is a blond with the name of Celina; sit at a table and be waited on my someone else.  If the bar attendant is a lady named Jessica; sit at the bar and enjoy the best bartender that I have ever had in my fifty years of drinking.  She will never let you run out of beer.  And the owner opened a bar in Murfreesboro; so his appearances here are few and far between.   Jennifer is the daytime barkeep and also manages the place in the owner's absence.  She does a good job of it; but Celina and one other person behind the bar would never work for me. [REVIEW_26] I visited Just Cookies to get some chocolate chip cookies for a friend and I before a concert at the (awesome) Murat.  Specialty bakeries are the best; unfortunately; this place was the worst.  For cookies at this price; they should be better than the discount day-old cookies at the supermarket..  much better; even!  But these were; somehow; worse.  Not just dry; but bland.  I couldn't believe that a bakery specializing on just one item could do them so poorly.  And while the woman was not explicitly rude; she certainly wasn't friendly either (not even a smile.)  To Just Cookies; I'll Just say No! [REVIEW_27] Been here twice now.  Both times I ordered a caesar salad with chicken; and both times it was a bust.  Some of the produce was wilted; browning and bitter; and just doused in dressing beyond anything reasonable.  Counter service was so-so.  First time I went in; there were two staff members taking their time.  I was third in line; and it took almost 20 minutes to walk out with my to-go order.  Second time I was in; there was literally no one behind the counter or anywhere in sight for almost 10 minutes.    No bueno; Fresh Bar.  Thanks anyway. [REVIEW_28] I'm here right now; listening to pretty offensive rap.  Ugly b*tches; hoes; F bombs....  very disappointing.  I'm open minded and listen to all sorts of stuff; but this is pretty out of control. [REVIEW_29] A great place for a haircut.  Nice people; professional; friendly; very reasonably priced and very skilled.  Open 7 days a week. [REVIEW_30] When I ordered delivery tonight; it gave me a 35-45 minute delivery time. The pizza arrived 70 minutes later. The pizza was cold and looked terrible.",6
35,"[REVIEW_1] Mediocre at best. We just spent $100 on a bottle of wine and five appetizers and it was totally underwhelming. The duck appetizer was tough with flabby skin. The scallop appetizer was cooked well. Roasted vegetables were overpriced at $10. Shrimp crostini was flavorless and didn't seem fresh. Meatballs were nothing to write home to mom about. Service was fine but we won't be back. [REVIEW_2] AMAZING!!! I just got back from the bakery. I ordered tres leche; hubby got chocolate dipped cannoli with original filling; we also got Italian wedding cookies; and dark chocolate florentine cookies. The tres leche taste just like my grandma used to make it minus the Malibu liquor. The cannoli was delicious. The Italian wedding cookies was a little crunchy yet still delicate; it also had the perfect amount of Anise flavor. The dark chocolate florentine is so yummy; that says a lot because I don't like coconut. The chocolate to coconut ratio is perfect. We will definitely be going back. [REVIEW_3] Food is expensive and not worth it. My hubby had carnitas - very dry. I had the scallops- expensive and undercooked. Not even a browned crust. Rice was served ""family style "" but do mushy and overlooked. I had a mango margarita that was completely bland and flavorless. We will not be going back. City fish was not good; but this is worse. And so disappointing- the idea of fresh quality Mexican food could have been so good. [REVIEW_4] I will never patronize King ribs on Georgetown Rd ever again. What is the point of calling in an order only to arrive 30 minutes later to be told that the order was never placed. Second time this has happened. They lied. I will never go back. [REVIEW_5] It's been a long while since a took a vacation;so i planned a 2 days get away to santa barbara to surprise my wife on the weekend .we drove there with my  09 camry & had a fun day;the next morning which was sunday we went down to start the car;but it didn't ;it was saying key not detected like i know what that is.so i called the toyota dealer after talking to a couple of people i was transfered to the manager who told me that he thinks its the remote control battery is dead but the parts department is closed;i told him i was out of town having a nice weekend with my wife so he told me to come down so i took a cab which cost me $50 by the way;i was so surprised with what happened next.since the parts department was closed the manager took a battery out from another remote put it in mine then called the courtesy shuttle to drive back & didn't charge me a dime.         It's nice to know that humanity & shivery still exist [REVIEW_6] Do not stay here!    We had a very bad experience with this hotel.  Let me start by saying that we reserved a room for our wedding night.  The next morning we had a very early flight to Montego Bay so we checked out of our room around 5:30 a.m. the next morning.  We actually had no complaints until we tried to use our debit card on a large purchase in Jamaica on our honeymoon and it was denied.  OK; this special time that only happens once in your life.... was completely ruined because this hotel charged our account 3 TIMES for the room amount at a whopping $240 a pop. We only left a small amount in our checking account because we were travelling out of country (just in case something happened and someone got our card number or something).  After getting charged $19.99 per MB to check our bank account using data on my cell phone; we discovered this MESS that Courtyard put us in.    We had planned on a couple's massage by the beach in Jamaica but that couldn't happen!  Plans on our honeymoon were ruined and I am still very upset!!!  After getting back into the states on a Saturday evening; I called the hotel to try and figure out what as going on.  I was told that a manager would have to speak with me and she would not be in until Tuesday.  I was forwarded to her voicemail and left a message.  The manager finally got back with me and she stated that she had no idea what was going on.  I explained to her my process through booking: I am a Marriott Rewards Member so I just logged into my account and booked a room.  After realizing that I would not be about to check into the room at check in since our wedding was at 4pm I called the hotel and added my husband to the account so that he could check into the room.  I also asked about how much the deposit for the room would be since Marriott usually charges a deposit in case of any charges.  The lady told me that it varies per hotel and I told her that I needed to know (since we were only transferring a certain amount into our checking).  She called the hotel and then finally got back on the line with me... she said that the deposit would not be more than $50.  When he went to check in he told them he wasn't sure what name the reservation was under it could have been either one of our last names. They found the reservation and got him checked in.  We checked out at 5:30 a.m. the next morning and that was all we knew.  The manager had then figured out what had happened: They created a new reservation for my husband and then charged me for a NO SHOW on my reservation.  The third charge was the pre-authorization that showed $220!  Let me re-cap:  They charged me 2 TIMES FOR THE ROOM and screwed up the check in.  THEN... they neglected to let us know that the pre-authorization and the room cost would be charged in the same amount on the same day of check in!  They also charged us for parking!  We had already parked our car in a parking garage and did not park with them!   The manager acted as if it was my husbands fault for creating a new reservation.   I assured her that he absolutely knew that we had a reservation and wouldn't have created a new reservation that it must have been her staff that messed up!    She credited my account for the no-show; told me that the pre-authorization takes 7 business days to fall off of the account; and then credited me for the parking.  She did credit back all fraudulent charges to our account!  However; she can never replace what we lost on our honeymoon all because of their screw ups and neglect in informing us about the pre-authorization and room charge on the same day!  (Basically it showed up twice in one day right after another... which makes no sense... usually a pre-authorization is charged to hold the money and then the balance is updated... like when you leave a tip at a restaurant... not two separate charges!).  Ridiculous!! [REVIEW_7] I went to see Dr. Taylor because a friend recommended him.  He did appear knowledgeable in many areas but did not listen to or honor the reasons for my visit.  Being a naturopath; he is familiar with both natural and allopathic methods of treatment.  Although his staff said he was familiar with the neurological issues I was asking about; he did little to discuss them with me.  He also did not ask if I wanted a more natural or allopathic approach.  He sent me out the door with an allopathic prescription for something he could have easily addressed with a natural approach.  When I called to cancel my follow up appointment; his staff was curt and dismissive and attempted to make me feel badly about cancelling.  He is not someone I would seek out if I was looking for a kind; respectful medical practitioner. [REVIEW_8] They did a nice job renovating the place; but the service is awful. Worst of all; the pancakes were terrible - chewy and flavorless. Last time I'll come here. [REVIEW_9] My dog and I are quite pleased with Jamie's Purple Poochie Parlor. I was previously taking my dog to another groomer in Metairie; but I have to say that Jamie's has been a much better experience. I feel just as excited to walk in the store front as my dog is and he is always in good spirits when I pick him up. I wish I lived a little closer to this place; but I'm most concerned with how my dog is treated and I leave this groomer with no worries. [REVIEW_10] I will not return to this location. I contacted the manager in regards to a poorly made pizza I received; he replied to my online inquiry but never followed through on taking care of things. I even sent a photo to prove that the appearance of the pizza was not acceptable; and I never heard back from him. [REVIEW_11] simply the best! everything from here is good! I come from a very Italian family and whenever there is a family event; there is always Termini brothers dessert trays! Their cannolis are amazing! Highly recommend. [REVIEW_12] Beware that this place charges $18 per day for parking and a ""resort fee"" of $15 for internet access; 2 bottles of water a day and on line access to a newspaper site. I reserved our room on line; and only found out about these fees when looking at the reviews on yelp when trying to find if any of the restaurants in the resort were worth trying. I called and spoke to a manager on duty about these fees and she refused to refund the fees since I checked the terms and conditions box on the reservations page. I informed the MOD that I had neglected to read all of the terms and conditions; therefore she refused to help. After returning home I looked at the terms and conditions on the reservations page; where the check box appears and indeed it does tell of the $15 resort fee; but fails to mention the $18 parking fee.   This room was $250 per night before taxes. The room was nothing special. I've stayed in La Quinta Inns and other places that were just as nice; if not better; for far less.   I also was left wondering what happened to the southern hospitality that us southerners are supposed to be so well known for.  When I pay $250 a night for a room; I don't expect to be charged exorbitant fees for things I get for free at far less expensive hotels. [REVIEW_13] I requested service because my gas oven heating was unreliable: sometimes; when turned on; it would heat as expected; other times it would not heat and I would smell natural gas odor. I was delighted; from the beginning of the process to the end: the person who answered my phone call on Monday and scheduled my appointment was friendly and helpful; appointment was scheduled for Wednesday; which was earlier than appointments offered to me by other appliance repair services that I had called; communication from company - by phone; email; and text - was well-timed and clear; repair technician was on-time and personable; he diagnosed the problem and fixed it efficiently (he had; based on the description that I had given when requesting the appointment; anticipated the cause and brought with him the required replacement component; an igniter); the company waived the service call charge - I paid for the repair (parts and labor) only. [REVIEW_14] We caught an Uber here and they wouldn't admit us with my backpack; nor check the backpack; nor search it. We had to miss our movie and wasted $30 on Uber fare there and back. Shitty. [REVIEW_15] Our son & his wife sent us the heart shaped box of chocolate covered strawberries with a 'Happy Anniversary' balloon for our 50th wedding anniversary this past Saturday. The store called to make sure we were home; the driver wished us a happy anniversary and the strawberries are still delicious and keeping well in the fridge. I would definitely send these to someone else. Well worth the price. [REVIEW_16] Had my phone inside a LIFEPROOF case and less than a week later; accidentally dropped it on a CARPETED floor and the screen shattered. Not so impressed anymore.  Oh; and it took a day or so to really notice; but their reinstallation include a slanted home button. (Is this related to the enormous shatter across the new screen; Apple people?) [REVIEW_17] Not impressed at all. Sandwich bar was closed so I ordered a burrito. It was reheated in the microwave; cost 8 bucks; and nasty. Some sort of cream of chicken and old cheese on top. I'm amazed they can sell this and call it food. Could have had better at taco bell. [REVIEW_18] I'm not sure why I'm writing this since you can just look at every other review written for this place and get the exact same story.   My wife was literally grabbed; like actually literally grabbed; by the face the second she stepped in the door. The culprit was a big-tittied shot girl that proceeded to dump a bunch of piss water down her throat. Then I was informed I owed her $24. When I refused to pay I was told the police were being called. My wife; not wanting to spend our trip coming to pick me up at the police station; (which is where I gladly would have gone rather than give a penny to these shady-ass MFers); swiped my wallet from my pocket and paid the bill.   Everybody there from the door guys to the managers to the bathroom attendants are the worst; most sketchy people on Bourbon Street. If you gave this place a five-star review please do humanity a favor and shoot yourself in the face. [REVIEW_19] House of Beauty is an absolute sham; and possibly a scam!  I ordered products from them some years ago; and waited a ridiculously long time to receive them.  I decided to try them again recently; ordered my products online more than 6 weeks ago; and have received NOTHING!  No one ever answers their phone; and I have written several emails with no response whatsoever.  DO NOT order anything from these people; they are terrible!  Angela [REVIEW_20] This is my second bad experience in a row at Stefano's. Tonight; I waited over 45 minutes for a call-in order they said would take 15 minutes. Then they were out of Greek dressing and told me they'd ""been out for a while"" - how does a Greek Italian restaurant run out of Greek dressing? [REVIEW_21] Expensive but great service & food. The ribeye melted in my mouth. The burger was huge & delicious w/ every bite. The bread pudding is everything it's hyped up to be. Definitely go at least once & share some meals w/ friends. [REVIEW_22] Where to start. The coleslaw was amazing and fresh good fresh crunch. Fries seasoned just right; tartar sauce and the FISH the  fresh; clean; battered perfect and meaty. [REVIEW_23] The service was so very bad. We walked out after waiting half an hour for any food to appear. Avoid this place. [REVIEW_24] This theater seriously needs to check on the customers. I've been here three times the past 6 months and I'm fed up. I'm never coming again. I'm always in a theater with someone that doesn't know the true meaning of a whisper. So now I'm subject to know why this teen can't be out to late and I have to keep my rage caged or risk going to jail for beating the crap out of some imbecile who doesn't have manners. [REVIEW_25] This place is terrible.  I should have gotten a clue based on the fact that I went there with a group of 8 people on a Saturday night and there were NO other customers in the restaurant. Needless to say; I ignored the signs and ate here.  This was literally the worst Thai food I have had in my entire life.    First; I ordered the tom yum soup.  They asked me how spicy I wanted it and I responded that I wanted it spicy.  I did not expect that the entire bowl of soup would be covered in red pepper flakes.  Disgusting. I spent ten minutes picking red pepper flakes out of the soup and my mouth.      I also tried the chicken satay.  The chicken was ice cold and as dry as beef jerky. The dipping sauce was a mix between curry and Planter's honey roasted peanuts.  It was a bizarre combination like nothing I've ever had before.  Once again...Disgusting.     Finally; I ordered curry.  I had high hopes that they could not screw up everything in my order.  Boy was I wrong.  The curry was bland and just plain gross.   Overall; all 8 of the people in my group left the restaurant dissatisfied. My recommendation is that you walk two blocks down the road and eat at the Blue Elephant Thai Restaurant. [REVIEW_26] Great selection and superior service.  The prices are slightly higher than the mega-stores like home depot; but it is worth it for the service and the neighborhood atmosphere. [REVIEW_27] Schlafly is a St. Louis gem with local brewing; restaurant; farmer's market; and spectacular events! I'm lucky enough to live in Maplewood so I can enjoy everything that Schlafly has to offer. Their beer is fantastic for being the largest 'Craft' brewer in town they still keep it fresh and interesting. Their pumpkin ale is the best I've ever had hands down. The food in the restaurant is tasty for brewery food and they have a store area that you can purchase bottles and growlers of any regular or seasonal brew they have. When the weather is nice they host a farmer's market in the parking lot on Wednesday nights which is small but a nice variety of local vendors. They also have beer samples while you do your shopping. I can't wait to shop their winter market next month which includes more options for Christmas shopping. I attended the Full Moon Festival this past weekend which had beer samples; live music; bonfires; pig roast; and chili cook off competition featuring local chefs from other restaurants. This is one of the festivals they host during the year I can't wait for the next one! [REVIEW_28] Whoa this place is good!!  Took my family there last night and was totally impressed. I had the heirloom tomato salad with salmon---WOW. Huge heirloom tomatoes with fresh burrata cheese piled high on peppery arugula with a fantastic olive oil simple dressing--and then a side of perfectly grilled salmon-- just excellent. Burgers were off the charts good as were sweet potato fries. Check this place out and you won't be disappointed. Remember to bring wine! [REVIEW_29] This was by far the worst dinner I have ever had. There were 4 of us: 1 only ate the meatballs; as the pasta had pizza sauce on them and were cold; 2nd ate 5 bites of his clam (canned) linguini because there was 3/4 cup of olive oil at the bottom of the bowl and no garlic or seasoning; 3rd; mine was over cooked chicken parm; eggplant parm was dry and over cooked and the ravioli were over salted...pizza sauce and melted cheese over the top. The service was bad and no compensation for any of it. AND it took 1 Hour to get served. [REVIEW_30] Had a business dinner here and was not disappointed. Prime location at the end of Rocky Point with amazing views of the bay from the dinner table. Atmosphere is dark and inviting and food was really great. Had the conch chowder and it was almost as good as the conch chowder I had recently in Nassau. Dinner was the pasta primavera with shrimp and get ready to eat for an army with the portion size. Nice selection of wine; I went with a really smooth glass of Sonoma Sauv Blanc. We did feel a bit underdressed in the environment but the bar with sports on television gave the white table clothes a nice relaxed balance. I will definitely eat here again and recommend to people I know.",12
36,"[REVIEW_1] Terrible service at this Domino's... They don't seem to have the ability to fulfill orders promptly and correctly. [REVIEW_2] I can't believe I have to give a star.  Quick rundown.  I ordered: single with no ketchup; mayo; or mustard with med fried and large unsweetened teas double with everything lg fries large coke 2 5 piece nuggets side salad cheeseburger kids meal plain with oranges and vanilla frosty. Ok now for what I GOT: double with bacon; no ketchup mayo or mustard; lg fries; coke single with everything; lg fries coke hamburger kids meal with fries and coke right around the time I said no ketchup a blank look came across the face of the employee. This is not rocket science. [REVIEW_3] Food is good; however if your attitude stinks I refuse to give you a good review. We've been here before while visiting PHilly we were in Delaware and decided to drive to Philly. Only to be greeted by someone who appeared to be having a bad start to the new year. Hope you have a great new year. [REVIEW_4] Very unhappy; you lost a valued customer. We had a problem where Monro Muffler underfilled our engine by 3 quarts of oil and caused damage to the engine. Monro's insurance company said they would pay for damages if we brought to the dealer; we were frequent customers of Bergeys so we brought it here. They discovered the timing chain needed to be replaced; a chain that lasts the life of the car unless you don't change the oil or have low oil pressure the tensioner can lock and stretch the chain. Joe the service associate that took the car in specifically said I told the insurance company as little as possible and told them he couldn't tell if it was from the oil and there was no way to tell. And on top of that; was extremely rude and unprofessional to my wife bringing her to tears the way he spoke to her. My wife and I just bought a house in the area; only 26 years old and you lost a life long customer. Over the past year we spent about $7000 in repairs here; and Joe went out of his way to be unhelpful and leave us in a terrible spot. I brought it to another mechanic who was able to help us prove more it was from the oil and do what Joe told us and the insurance company they could not do. So on top of losing a service customer; I'm on the market for a new car and can tell you for sure where I will not be getting it. [REVIEW_5] I've been here a few times with no issues... this time was horrible! I guess because they were working on my teen they assumed they could cut corners and do a horrible;  sloppy job.  Word to the wise drive up a few blocks to LA nails at Bustleton/Bowler for real service. [REVIEW_6] The Loop looks great on paper but living there was just average and overpriced. The worst thing though was dealing with the management; very frustrating! On move in day a bronken blind was reported and still has not been fixed a year later. Ants moved in soon after my son did and they were lucky enough to stay the year too. Management did not respond to emails or to any other efforts to contact them with problems or questions. When my son moved out; leaving the room in tip top condition; we were told the security deposit would be returned within a week. Six weeks later still no deposit. Its nearly impossible to get someone on the phone to help so finally an email told us they sent our deposit to the wrong address! Instead of getting our deposit to us quickly; knowing they made a huge mistake; they claim they could only get us our money in another three to six weeks! The management at The Loop is terrible! Live somewhere else! [REVIEW_7] ""Pastichio layers of long macaroni; ground sirloin of beef; béchamel sauce; and Parmesan Cheese."" $15.00. What came out was a poorly reheated 4""X6"" square of a layer of macaroni topped with ground beef; 1"" of browned mashed potatoes. What you don't see mashed potatoes in the description of the dish? You thought that the word ""layers"" meant more than one?  You thought that béchamel was a sauce?  You thought Parmesan cheese usually could be seen or when melted looked like it had been grated rather than an overdone mashed potato.  When I asked the waiter; he said that those were not mashed potatoes; it was solid béchamel; that they no longer put a liquid sauce on the dish.  I asked him why the menu said sauce and he just shrugged his shoulders.   Several minutes later the manager came by; offered the same lame story and offered to bring me something else.  When asked about the potatoes; just looked at me as if to say; you should have known Pastichio has potatoes.  By this time; I was and am pissed off that I was told twice I should have guessed about the mashed potatoes; and that béchamel was not a sauce.  My cousin's Pasta Angelo was supposed to have ""grilled"" chicken; it was baked or cooked on a flat top.  The sauce was ok.  My wife enjoyed the Chicken Piccata. [REVIEW_8] The staff is very good at providing misinformation with; what I can only guess is; the objective of stretching out simple things into multiple; billable appointments. Be sure to show up on time so you can have the honor of waiting for netley d'souza to stroll by; in an unapologetic fashion; 45 minutes after your scheduled appointment. A word of caution; though. Do not suggest that his staff treat you with decency or that anyone other than yourself be punctual. Doctor d'souza will respond by having a staff member call you to tell you to find another doctor. If you're looking for integrity; punctuality; consideration for your time; a competent staff; a doctor who is on top of his game; or anyone to do anything other than give you a hard time or do more than the bare minimum; well; I guess you had better keep looking. [REVIEW_9] (This review was attached to the previous address and name a few months after they opened at TV and Cat Highway; I have moved it here; though another form of the name is on the map too?) anyway ... We tried to dine here. I called ahead to ask some questions about the menu and some allergies we work with in our family (because I know that stopping the flow of a dinner service to ask the chef and/or manager questions isn't cool.) So I got the manager on the phone and it's clear that she isn't trained in the school of customer service and food allergies. I get it. Allergies suck to have to accommodate--even if it's just to answer a question about ingredients (try living with it). But when it comes down to having a table full of vomit and/or an epi pen getting whipped out; ""Pretty sure..."" just doesn't cut it. Apparently they get their bread/buns from Vero's and therefore in the mystical teleportation device that procures the bread; no ingredient list is a available. But that's okay because some of their employees have worked there for like 10 years and know a lot of ingredients and things. But just not for sure if the buns contain eggs. But I could call Vero's myself to check. *sigh* I tried helping educate this defensive manager about how to better serve a party with food allergies (step 1: don't tell them to call a vendor to check your own product); but what's the point? They clearly didn't want our business anyway. [REVIEW_10] We would have loved to try this restaurant but unfortunately we were told they had stopped serving food when we got there (we got there shortly before 10pm). The Eldorado website clearly stated that they served lunch and dinner until close. I was very unimpressed. We did not even have a chance to try their beer as we had been driving for 5 hours and needed food first. [REVIEW_11] Awful awful awful went in today to have lunch with my husband we ordered we get to the register and they inform us there's no ice for the drinks we ordered do we still want them I say yes because I made the wrongful assumption that the soda would at least be cold and drinkable boy was I wrong not only was it hot but it had no carbonation what so ever. Now mine you we paid for these drinks I don't know about you but I've worked in the food industry and my store has ran out of ice before and we went to the grocery store and bought bags of ice brought them back and made sure our customers were happy until we could fix the situation apparently that was not the managers idea at this store. So instead of just saying sorry our drink situation sucks today u can have it for free they charge us. I went to 5 guys and got us cold drinks we started eating our burritos were disgusting they tasted like cat food and the chips were completely plain no lime or salt at all! Clearly someone has dropped the ball at this chipotle because it was complete garbage! I hope they can turn this store around because they've now lost a customer [REVIEW_12] BEWARE ....this hotel has a case of bedbugs. I woke up at 1am scratiching my arm and I saw welts. I get out the bed turn on the light and I see one bug dead and one bug moving around in the bed. I told the night guy at the front desk to look at my video and he didn't want to see it he said you can't go back in your room we have to quarantine it. You can't grab any of your belongings.   I ask to speak to the manager for a refund. Not only that I hope that the bugs did not get to my small luggage. The guy said he is the night auditor and can't answer any questions. He was a complete asshole After ready some reviews others have complained of bed bugs. There are many other hotels don't stay at this one. [REVIEW_13] I'm here right now; listening to pretty offensive rap.  Ugly b*tches; hoes; F bombs....  very disappointing.  I'm open minded and listen to all sorts of stuff; but this is pretty out of control. [REVIEW_14] This place makes all other sweet shops look like amateurs. I had a chance to try their salted caramel banana pudding and their hot apple cider. Let me tell you!  Once you try their stuff you won't want anything else other than their sweets!  They are that good!  Also; the folks that run and work at this shop are very friendly. They make you feel like you are at home. No pretentiousness here either. It's all about putting out a superior product and they succeed! [REVIEW_15] Just in Philadelphia for a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon -- our first visit.  Wanted outdoor seating and chose RR because the tables seated 3.  Big mistake.  We were seated at about 1pm.  Drinks came pretty quickly and the server was very nice.  We ordered a Cheese Steak; Hot Roast Pork and a Rueben all with fries.  After an hour we started asking about our lunches; at one point the servers said that our order was about 1/2 prepared.  Wait. What?  An hour+ for three sandwiches?  They said they were slammed.  We could see three open tables outside and two other tables seated after us had already received food.  Lots of ""I'm sorries"" from the wait staff.  We insisted on a complimentary round of drinks (which they did agree to).  When the food finally came; the Roast Pork sandwich and fries were completely cold (guess that was the half that was done on time).  The pork was fine; but the roll just average and the gravy was awful.  Fries; meh.  Cheese Steak filling looked like ground beef and was a miniscule portion in a large grinder roll.  The Rueben looked OK.  We should have checked reviews before sitting down; but it was getting late and we just wanted to catch a beer and a sandwich. [REVIEW_16] Just left; no food no service! We where sat down and waited 10 minutes while the staff held their conversation. Piss poor service! Had to give one star or else couldn't post; it deserves no star! [REVIEW_17] I haven't eaten here in a while because a friend of mines quit; due to rude employers. But I was just starving. I went to order an omelette with the veggies wrapped inside instead of cooked in. I was told that I could not have it that way. Once I asked why??? Both cashiers snapped at me and told me that the cook had the right to make it however he pleased and couldn't I see how busy they were. And they didn't have anytime to special make my order.... After a verbal argument between me and the staff the had to nerve to ask if I still wanted to order. This place has good food but very very poor customer service skills. I will never spend my money there ever again... The worst service I have ever received. [REVIEW_18] Ahhhhhh this place is so good! Yes; it's small and there's usually a wait. But it is so worth it.   The noodles are never soggy or over cooked. The broth is flavorful. The ingredients are fresh. You get generous portions of meat. The menu is varied. The service is friendly. The food comes out quickly. I have no complaints except that I wish I lived closer! [REVIEW_19] Very disappointed :( We came first thing in the morning; but we're rushed through because a group had appointments an HOUR later. The girl didn't clean out my toes; skipped my cuticles; and proceeded to BURN me with her callous sander. For four days I've been walking around with sander induced Blisters and they hurt like heck! She put two coats on my big toe and one on the other toes. The decor is nice; but the staff is unprofessional and need to be trained how to do nails without rushing. You won't get return customers with this level of service. [REVIEW_20] I am so; so; happy to finally have used the gift certificate I had so that I never have to go back to Everlasting Spa.    I got a gift certificate to go there last December.  It expires this November; so I was trying to use it before it was no longer valid.  With this said; I tried to make an appointment to go since this past Winter.  I was NEVER able to get in.  Seriously; what kind of nail salon doesn't have availability on a random afternoon?  Anyways...  I finally called last week; knowing it would take a while to get an appointment; and I went this afternoon.  My certificate was for a ""signature pedicure; signature facial; and 60 minute massage"".  I really only wanted a manicure and a pedicure; as I didn't want a random facial from this place; so I asked them to please give me a manicure instead of a facial.  It's a win for them; so they went with it.  I was planning to get the massage; but when I got there; I wasn't feeling it (the bad reviews here helped sway my decision) and instead; I was told that ""the pedicure massage will be longer"".  Fine.  Whatever.    I must mention that the ""spa"" is in the back of a store.  There is one manicure station and three pedicure chairs.  In the back of a store...  I repeat.    Upon sitting down for the pedicure; I was told that they would be giving me the manicure at the same time.  I typically get this when a place is super busy and they are trying to save me time...  but I was one of two people in the entire place.  There was no need to double-up on services.  The manicure was terrible.  They used a super coarse file on my nails that had already been soaking in water (bad idea!); and they cut my cuticles without any oil or other softening agent.  When I asked the girl to clean up the polish around the cuticles; I was told that she would ""when she was done"".  Well; it's about 8 hours later; and my nails look like crap...  so I guess she lied.    The girl who did my pedicure was very nice.  But her skills as a pedicure-giver were lacking.  However; in her defense; she may have been distracted by the 5 phone calls she GOT UP TO ANSWER during the course of my pedicure.  Or; possibly the other customer who wanted to pay...  she got up to help them; too.  Once my pedicure was done; I asked if I could dry my toe nails; and one of the women there told me that I didn't need to dry my toes because I was wearing sandals.  Umm...  what?    I will never go back to Everlasting Spa.  I would suggest that you don't go at all...  or if you have a random Groupon or Living Social deal; get your money back from them.  Not worth the trip. [REVIEW_21] I absolutely hate giving Smashburger only one star because I have had delicious food and great service in the past. But tonight's experience was bad at best. When I walked in and saw it wasn't crowded I was happy; thinking I'd be in and served quickly. I placed my order with the super friendly cashier and had a smile on my face as I sat down to wait for the deliciousness to ensue. Then I kept waiting. And then waited some more. And then a little while longer. 26 minutes after I ordered; my food finally arrived! The burger seemed to be lacking a little in presentation (the tomatoes and guacamole were not even on the bun); but surely the taste would make up for it. Unfortunately; it tasted like my fries had been ready and waiting for at least 15 minutes. And there's nothing like a bite into a handful of lukewarm fries to start a meal off on the wrong foot. But maybe the burger would be the star of the plate? After a few crunches (yes; crunches) that was clearly not the case. The edges of my burger were literally crunchy and very salty (I guess it took a few extra minutes to go from slightly charred to crunchy; hence the long ticket time). By the time I finished my meal; my fries were cold; and miserably so (and I'm not a slow eater). I would usually consider this to be one of the best ""quick"" burgers around; but for the time and cost of today's visit; I likely could have gone to a full service restaurant and gotten something of much better quality. Really a shame; but if this is the new normal at Smashburger; it can't possibly last much longer here. [REVIEW_22] If I could give this restaurant 0 stars I wouldn't hesitate for a millisecond.  I just finished eating at Ru San's with 3 other people.  One of the people in my party didn't even receive their food until we were sitting at the hostess stand waiting TO LEAVE!! Granted the waitress continually reminded us that it was only her 3rd shift; but every mistake was inexcusable.  We walked into the restaurant at 8:30 pm; during the time we were there our order was messed up several times; random food was brought to us many times and we were constantly asked if we had ordered it or not. We had to remind our waitress several times what our order was; additionally when we stopped her to remind her that we had been waiting 30+ minutes for certain items she argued with us by saying that she had already brought it.  If she had actually brought it then it would have probably been in the pile of dishes that littered our table; which another waitress came by to clear AT THE END OF THE MEAL.  Of course; the one dish missing from the dirty junk on our table was the plate that should have been the trash for the shells of TWO orders of edamame we had.  Even though we waited one hour and a half for ONE sushi roll all we got was a simple ""sorry."" Never once did we ever see a manager even to ask if we needed anything or to apologize for the completely ridiculous amount of time we spent at our table. Having been in the restaurant industry since I was 16; I did feel bad that our waitress' colleagues simply let her drown. Unacceptable.  When we left it was 10:20.  The cherry on top; one of our guests had to smash a bug crawling up the wall  of our booth.  DO NOT EAT AT RU SAN'S. [REVIEW_23] Service sucks!  We had a party of 12.  We couldn't get enough chips.  We got 1!  I ordered table side guacamole and had to ask for chips.  We couldn't get drinks.  Waitress couldn't keep focused on each person and was very scattered.  Won't be back for the spendy Mexican food. [REVIEW_24] Went there yesterday the combo was almost 10.00 the burger was burned to a crisp;fries and drink were good when I told the cashier she said they all look like that baby so I threw everything including their little red basket in the trash.There was a couple of employees off the clock sitting in the restaurant cursing and laughing so loud that a few couples got up and left.No management or customer service skills in that entire place!Save your money and go and buy some fresh ground meat and make a real burger! [REVIEW_25] Terribly slow service; as in over 30 minutes in a short line. Very rude employees and quite dirty. Very disappointed in the quality all around. Will not be returning to this place again. [REVIEW_26] I'm fussy about breakfast places. I have to say; I don't know of a better place to go.  Service is super fast; the portions are the right size and everything tastes fresh.  The home fries are not super greasy like other places; the scrambled eggs are always cooked perfectly; bacon is thick and cooked right and the pancakes are awesome! We have been there a couple of times and I have not been disappointed.  Forget the big impersonal chains. For a great LOCAL place; come here. [REVIEW_27] The steak is okay. I give it a 1 because it's not worth the price. Very expensive. You can find a much better steak at other restaurants in town. Plus; my experience was dampened by some annoying couple trying to sell me real estate as I ate at the bar. [REVIEW_28] To start off: I have never left a bad review before. It's usually not worth the effort; and if I don't like a restaurant I simply won't go back. But this place... my goodness. Easily one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had.   Ordered the Veggie Benedict; but asked if I could have it with egg whites. The server was puzzled and said that it already came with egg whites. Ok no big deal; it was strange that it wasn't listed that way on the menu but whatever. The server comes back a couple minutes later: ""It does come with normal eggs! All this time I thought poached eggs meant egg whites."" Uh; ok. A bit odd for a server at a restaurant that literally specializes in eggs; but still not an issue. She asks if I do indeed want the egg whites; and I say yes. A couple more minutes pass; and she comes back. ""Our kitchen doesn't know how to poach egg whites; so if you want them they'll have to scramble them."" What?? You poach an egg white just like you poach an egg. But whatever; I don't care that much so; ""Sure; that's fine.""  It took us a very long time to get our food. The restaurant was not busy. Empty tables; no wait.  Finally our food comes out; and what do you know it's cold. Not just room temp. Cold. We mention it to the server who proceeds to tell us it's because the restaurant doesn't use heat lamps because ""they have so many hands."" Apparently not enough hands to get the food out within a half hour; and to get it out warm.   On to the food itself. I ordered what should've been a relatively healthy; easy meal. I got a plate that was literally covered in so much oil that my bennies were swimming. We're talking greasier than the greasiest Chicago pizza; but not due to fat from sausage or cheese. Oh no. There is no reason it should've been greasy at all; since all it had was spinach; wild mushrooms; asparagus; and tomatoes. It was literally just vegetable/canola oil. Even the side salad was drowning in its oily dressing. It was to the point that my own mother commented that if it had been her food; she wouldn't have touched it. We're not picky eaters; we eat anything and everything. So I proceeded to try some of my cold; oily concoction and unsurprisingly it tasted like nothing. It was so oily that none of the flavors of the vegetables could come out; and left my mouth; lips; and even fingers shining. And the hollandaise... oh god. What should've been a nice lemony-buttery sauce was a blob with the consistency of expired box pudding. Skin and all. And it tasted like nothing I've ever had before... maybe similar to cheese wiz? The stuff in a can? Yeah.   With all of the other brunch places around (Wild Eggs; Yolk; First Watch; Le Peep) there's no reason anyone should go to The Egg & I. [REVIEW_29] Went because a friend ask me to meet her there. It lived up to all the bad reviews given. It was 7pm 3 people at the bar; bartender playing on her phone & talking to her friend at the end of the bar. No hello; can I get you something? After standing at the bar for a while she finally came over. I ordered a beer which she handed me unopened. I paid and walk to the table my friend and 3 others were sitting. At about 8pm 15 very young people walked in and had an even longer wait for her to even acknowledge there presence. I was guessing for Karaoke which doesn't start till 9pm. I left at 8:30pm. I have no idea how they stay in business and certainly don't know how she makes any money. Clearly the owner is not interested in making this a place to go. I went to the Old Double D many many years ago and I bet the original owner is glad he's gone-he should have never let them keep the name. [REVIEW_30] Walked in on a quiet Wednesday night; where only three other tables were occupied.  We should've walked out right then and there; but we figured it was just a mid-week lull.  This is not an exaggeration; but FIVE MINUTES after we ordered; our food came out.  At least they could've *pretended* they were cooking our food to order; rather than simply reheating leftovers.  Our dish of complimentary cornbread was bone-dry.  Perhaps it had been drenched in honey butter a day or two prior; but it certainly hadn't seen any moisture that day.  Our gumbo was cold on top but piping hot on the bottom; so we mixed up the bowl to get a lukewarm appetizer.  Based on other Yelpers' reviews about the ""tough"" creole rabbit; Olivier's preys on people who have never eaten rabbit before.  We've cooked numerous rabbit dishes at home and know how tender it can be.  Again; the rabbit might've been tender at some point; but it was certainly not cooked fresh that day.  It was also cold to the touch; and the accompanying rice pilaf was super dry.  All told; we were seated; ordered; fed; paid; and out the door in 35 minutes.  Another minus:  Olivier's website shows the creole rabbit priced at $22.95; so you're ready to spend $20ish; but once you're in the restaurant; it's $27.95 and you're spending almost $30 for a reheated plate of mediocre food.  The only plus is that the waitress was super nice and made us feel right at home.  That wasn't enough to save the experience; though.    I expect to see Olivier's on Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares soon.",3
37,"[REVIEW_1] I really wanted to like Casselli's; but it wasn't in the cards. Maybe I just caught them on a bad night; but I didn't really enjoy much about my visit. The waiter was very unpleasant - was banging down the plates and glasses on the table when he delivered them. Maybe he was having a bad day; but I still would have expected better.   We had mixed experiences with the food. Mine and our friends' was OK; but my wife's baked ravioli would have been more use to a hockey team for use as pucks. They were really overdone - woefully overdone.   The worst part was that our table was next to the opera singer guy. He was singing extremely loudly and it was nigh impossible to maintain a conversation - especially coupled with how close we were to the table next to us and their attempts to speak over Opera Guy.  Part of me wants to give them another chance (since I hate writing bad reviews) and the other part is annoyed over the waiter's attitude. I probably will not go back. There are so many good Italian restaurants worth visiting that the opportunity cost of returning to Casselli's seems too high.  On the upside; they have somewhat convenient parking in the lot behind the restaurant (near the Shawmont School).  Note: cash-only. [REVIEW_2] Our office went today for Friday's happy hour special.  Such a great deal; and it wasn't packed.  Didn't expect it; but the food and drinks on their specials-amazing!  Usually the happy hour offerings wouldn't be. Definitely try the pork sliders and the beignets for dessert.  Really fun time and great atmosphere.  Staff was very friendly too! [REVIEW_3] Food showed up cold; salmon was raw inside; plastic in the dessert; fatty lamb chops and some sort of stringy thing at the bottom of my wine glass!! The service was great though. [REVIEW_4] This is my kind of place - they use fresh everything and the seasonings are expert.  The service on Friday nights is fantastic.    Over the years; the cooking has improved and is tastier than ever.  It's hard to get a seat; so plan on waiting 30 minutes on a busy night - that being said; it's not long until you are seated and promptly given water and they have real candles here.    I always order the coconut soup (I order it with the tofu ""not fried"") and also the yellow curry with tofu - also not fried.  It lends a more delicate flavor to the already rich curry.  It is to die for - tastes like dessert.  It is served with rice.  Last time I ordered the Pho - my goodness; the bowl is so huge and served with two sauces - hoisin and siracha.  Very good and filling - I would order it next time with more veggies (they are very good at helping you with special orders)  This is a BYOB and the prices can't be beat.  The menu keeps getting larger and I only wish I were closer to this place; as I would come here weekly for sure! [REVIEW_5] I've ordered twice from here and each time the medium pizzas had a five inches of crust. On one ocassion they only put my toppings on half the pizza when it was to be on the whole thing. Never again [REVIEW_6] Everyone my grandparents come up from Florida they request to go here for dinner. It's awesome. Beautiful inside . Great service all the waiters and waitress work together. Good is miraculous especially the ribs. The meat just falls right off the bone. [REVIEW_7] My husband and I moved to Spring Hill from Chicago in July. We were reluctant to try Guido's because it sounded too good to be true. Our insurance agency is located next door and we were told we would not be disappointed. My husband will only eat thin crust pizza. To him; thick crust and stuffed are not really pizza. Well; we were very pleased with everything about Guido's. The service was wonderful. Staff and other patrons were very friendly. The owner took the time to talk to us about the history of the restaurant. But; best of all; the pizza was outstanding.  I thought my husband raved because he hadn't had pizza for three months. He said no; he knows great pizza and this was a great pie! We will absolutely be regulars at Guido's; both dine in and carry out. [REVIEW_8] I am not sure they deserve one star..but they do not deserve two. Went this afternoon shortly after lunchtime. Walked in and was seated with my girl near the buffet. We discussed eating from it...but decided against it. I haven't been to a CM since the one left the Foothills mall many years ago....I never had any issue with anything at that location. The one on Campbell was not good. Server was polite; but when she came and gave us silverware...it was as if she was playing tiddlywinks...I was a bit perplexed when my three pieces were laid down knife....spoon over knife at a 45 degree angle; then the fork over top the same way...about 6 inches from my napkin. I hadn't thought about it until now...but I feel she was trying in code to tell me not to eat there. Yeah....that has to be it. I looked at the fork...and it looked as if it was taken from the table behind us....as they were using it....it was replaced with a clean one....I am hoping it was anyways...at least there was nothing on it that I could see...and that is 90% of the battle. On to the food. I ordered a chorizo burro. $9.00. This was the driest chorizo I have ever eaten....as my girth with attest.....I have had much chorizo in my life. About three hours after.....I feel yucky. Anyways.....I will not be returning here. [REVIEW_9] Worst customer service ever; food is par by far; dirty tables; nothing like a real New York slice; I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is away from home in need of a slice of pie. I taste the time frame of some of the ingredients; Like they sat to long before being used. How could the great state of NY ever allow people who serve crappy food to use their name. [REVIEW_10] The Barrio IPA is awesome! Paired with beer sponges and you have a great treat!  A+ [REVIEW_11] Emmanuelle is beautiful; from the walls; to the chandelier; to the drinks; to the bar set up; to the bathrooms. All of it.  I don't often write reviews this short; but that's all you need to know. There is nothing bad that can possibly be said. I wish this place was closer to where I live.   Just; love. [REVIEW_12] Just having moved here; I've been spurned by previous take out experience that I was hesitant about ordering from yet another Chinese food place. I was completely wrong! The Taiwanese sausage rice noodles were great; chicken fried rice was excellent; and the garlic chicken had spice but not enough to make your mouth feel like it was burning. 10/10 would definitely go back and try other items on their menu.  The only thing I thought tasted weird were the wontons in the wonton soup; it had a different taste to what I had been used to but the other food we ordered were great so it's not enough to turn me away from going back to their place. [REVIEW_13] Rex's first visit won't be his last! I loved the fact Zoey was familiar with the breed. He came home handsome and smelling great. [REVIEW_14] We just had my daughter's first birthday party and ordered from Testa's the black-white cake with buttercream frosting.  We also ordered a single mini-sized same cake just for my daughter.  They were both delicious!  Service was exceptional.  They scanned a photo for the half-sheet (easily fed 30 ppl) and it came out great. [REVIEW_15] I visited Just Cookies to get some chocolate chip cookies for a friend and I before a concert at the (awesome) Murat.  Specialty bakeries are the best; unfortunately; this place was the worst.  For cookies at this price; they should be better than the discount day-old cookies at the supermarket..  much better; even!  But these were; somehow; worse.  Not just dry; but bland.  I couldn't believe that a bakery specializing on just one item could do them so poorly.  And while the woman was not explicitly rude; she certainly wasn't friendly either (not even a smile.)  To Just Cookies; I'll Just say No! [REVIEW_16] We stopped in while exploring Tarpon Springs for the first time. We were seated immediately even though the restaurant was bustling. Our server; Soula; was very personable and gave us her genuine opinion when we asked. I ordered the Greek Style Scallops and they were very good. My friend ordered the combination plate which was really good if you have not had Greek food and want to try multiple things. [REVIEW_17] Don't go here during late night. Fast food resteraunts in the city love to not give a shit at 2:00am and not take your order even though their open 24/hrs. Terrible. [REVIEW_18] I had my Co worker pick up a to go order. The food was all fabulous.  I thought it was pricey until I saw the quality and amount of food that you get! The coleslaw is unique and delicious! If you haven't tried this place; go! I can't wait to try the cajun meatloaf; available after 5 p.m. Great job Jungle Prada Tavern Team! I will be back! [REVIEW_19] Best Mexican spot in town delicious food and amazing service I'm from Victorville California and every time I'm in town I make sure I stop here Bistro Habanero is the BOMB !!!! [REVIEW_20] Magick Candle rests snuggly in Irvington with tons of character. I absolutely loved their selection of herbs! They had low priced taper candles and the most elegant but yet ""out-there"" looking necklaces. The store owner was so passionate when she was talking about the herbs she has; which is really nice to see someone doing what they love as a job. The store owner even had 2 cats roaming around that were so cute and friendly! There are also bookshelves full of meditation; pagan; and mythology books! Overall I absolutely loved the feel of the atmosphere in the store. It's an amazing cute shop for anyone interested in holistic items. [REVIEW_21] My sister and I stopped in a couple of weeks ago.  On the weekend; we were driving and wondering where to go to get a bite to eat. I was telling her that I was was craving a crepe.  She suggested trying The Creperie.  We found our new favorite place.  We ended up ordering both savory and sweet crepes; yummy.  The service was good; too.  I highly recommend them. [REVIEW_22] BrightNow Dental was an ok dentist until I made an appointment & went in that morning at my scheduled time just to be turned away because I missed an appointment a few months before. Which was because of family emergencies. I even called & left messages on their answering machines to reschedule & they never called me back. So my tooth started hurting really bad & I made an appointment. Went in & the dentist turned me away with an excruciating hurting tooth just bcuz I missed an appointment a few months before. I've never been turned away from a doctor or dentist before. I found it to be very unprofessional from the dentist standpoint because he didn't even talk to me. The assistant did. I will never go back & I will not recommend this dentist to anyone. [REVIEW_23] The breakfast menu and pastry menu changes so some visits I have liked more than others; but I love the way they do there menu; the overall quality is top notch. The food is funky and creative. I would not say its an every weekend brunch spot with the old reliable eggs florentine​/pancakes but it is fun and I love coming here from time to time. Beware the line can get long but they have very good coffee and pastries​ to hold you over while you wait.  p.s. The restaurant​ vibes are great! [REVIEW_24] Hands down favorite sub place around. The atmosphere is fun with the fire fighter theme- they totally roll with It from the table decor to the names of the subs. Who doesn't love a hot sub!? They are by far more unique than subway or jimmy johns or any other sub place. They don't have many bread options but the toppings and wide selection of hot sauces makes up for that- talk about flavor! I love the sub machine with the over 120 drink options but with only one machine it takes forever to get your drink.... But at least you can make it special! Every time I go here it's packed! The customer service is great; I love that they walk your meal to you; it's better than standing around or having a pager. They also do boxed lunches or catering which is always a great addition to any party. [REVIEW_25] Was hesitant to return after my last check in but drinks were dope again as of several days ago. [REVIEW_26] There is a banner on the website that says ""free shipping over $50"". This company hates honoring this promotion and it's always a a hassle to get the free shipping and they conveniently have the shopping cart set up to always charge the shipping fee even if your order total qualifies for the free shipping. Anyway; my order total came to $160 but I was still charged shipping at checkout. So I called cust svc and spoke to an idiot beyotch that was hostile and completely mathematically challenged and illogical; as her defense was that since I used a coupon on my order; I should be okay with paying the shipping fee. Huh?! When that excuse didn't work; she then said I wasn't charged shipping for the conditioner (I had 4  items on my order). Umm; that makes no sense; as I'm still paying shipping on the other items (that are packaged in the same box as the ""freely shipped"" conditioner); plus the  shipping fee is a flate rate; so what good is it if one item out of 4 is shipped free?!  I have spent hundreds of dollars w/ this company but will never ever shop here again. My advice to all consumers is to bankrupt companies that don't appreciate your business. [REVIEW_27] I had just moved to Nashville and one of my friends told me I HAD to come here. We're not both from here originally so technically we were still tourists at this point. Anyways; I went around 9:15 and the line wasn't too bad - I'd say a 5-10 minute wait. The food was awesome. I had the chocolate chip pancakes which were to die for. The sausage side I had didn't rock my world then again it's not the Side Dish Pantry. You don't pay at the table - they ring you up by the door to try and get people in and out fast which seems to work because the line is always moving fairly fast.    Rip : I drive by it almost every morning - if you want to avoid the line go either RIGHT when they open to around 7:15 [REVIEW_28] So many wonderful choices on the menu made it hard to pick. We choose the Fruit & Yogurt Power Jar along with the Chicken Biscuit with City Grits. The food was very good; we had great service from Linda and I was amazed how clean the kitchen was since I got a good view whenever the enter door opened.u [REVIEW_29] Wait is not worth it. Almost an hour and they don't seem to have any sense of urgency. And the air conditioning is spotty. It's a good product but I won't be back and they're lucky this is tampa and not Seattle. With this kind of wait; little seating and no air - this place would have never survived in a market with competition. They need to get a better system for serving people if they want to remain open after the new ness wears off. I won't be back and I'm willing to bet this is a lot of people's first and last visit. I wish them well though and want them to succeed. But they have to fix the air and wait times. [REVIEW_30] Great friendly and fast service; solid pizza; huge and delicious Greek salad; cheesy garlic bread; homemade rice pudding",20
38,"[REVIEW_1] Whoa this place is good!!  Took my family there last night and was totally impressed. I had the heirloom tomato salad with salmon---WOW. Huge heirloom tomatoes with fresh burrata cheese piled high on peppery arugula with a fantastic olive oil simple dressing--and then a side of perfectly grilled salmon-- just excellent. Burgers were off the charts good as were sweet potato fries. Check this place out and you won't be disappointed. Remember to bring wine! [REVIEW_2] Changing this to a 1 after I just had to pay $10 to park. Seriously?   Not like they aren't making any money on anything else in there..... [REVIEW_3] Terrible seating experience. We walked into the restaurant. Half the tables were empty (not exaggerating; I counted). The host said ""we are too busy; 35 minute wait"". We put our name down for optionality; and not 7 minutes later we were texted that our table was ready. We arrived at the restaurant and were made to wait another 10 minutes because the host was ""busy"". [REVIEW_4] Ok yeah; the service can be a little high falutin'; and the wait is painful but this is THE BEST BURGER EVER.  That's all you need to know.  The BEST. [REVIEW_5] The food at this Qdoba was standard; but the service was horrible!  There were three people behind the counter and none of them wanted to help customers.  There was no one in line; and two of the three just kept standing at the sink talking to each other even after the third employee tried to call over the person working the first station.  We waited and waited; and a line of 3 other couples built up before the gentleman at the first station finally sighed loudly and walked to his station. [REVIEW_6] By far the worst hotel experience of my life.  The reservations staff makes promises that the front desk are not able/willing to keep; and you are left without the room you expected.  This morning the fire alarm went off in the hallway - the cleaning staff out in the hall had no idea what was going on; but said that if it was a drill; an announcement would have come over the loudspeaker.  I'm on the 15th floor; elevators disabled.  Called down to the front desk; only to be put on hold.  Several other hotel guests were in the hall trying to figure out what to do.  Once the alarm was off and the elevator was working I went down to the front desk and was told that ""they"" were checking and working on the elevators and alarms; and that this would be happening all day.  There WAS a sign on the 1st floor about this; but absolutely NO NOTIFICATION to any of the guests on the upper floors.  At least not to the half dozen or so people I spoke to.  I told the manager that she had many terrified people up there; and that the hotel should have made an effort to notify their guests - push a note under the room door; leave a phone message; or at least inform the cleaning staff so they could pass the word along.  I told her that I would leave the hotel if I could; but that I had one more day there.  She offered to cancel my stay so I could leave early.  WOW....what a way to handle a disgruntled guest who has a bill of over $2000 at your hotel.  To not keep reservation promises and not care about how it inconveniences your guests is one thing; but to not care about their safety; and leave them terrified...that's a totally different thing.  I will never stay at this hotel or any of the other hotels/resorts run by the Summit Group. [REVIEW_7] When your waitress says ""the kitchen is crashing and burning"" you know this isn't going to go well. My husband's beer sat empty while she focused on her only other table. Another waitress stepped in to get him a refill. Two of our three meals came out. Thinking his pizza was on the way we went ahead and started eating. 15 mins later his pizza is MIA and the waitress was confused as to why he wanted to cancel his order and have it taken off the bill. There was no manager visible and the situation could've been handled much better. It's a shame because they have great food and good beer. We won't be back. [REVIEW_8] If you can't come to work with pride and energy and enthusiasm then don't work at a McDonald's where people are in a hurry to get somewhere else.....so disappointed in the behavior of humans! [REVIEW_9] 2 hours I'll never get back. Waited for the food for an hour before the bartender came back and asked if I ordered something I had not. Clearly had not even put my order in. Another hour wait to close my tab. My drink was refilled once in this 2 hour time period. The food was actually good; but wasting 2 hours of my day in an atmosphere (terribly loud at 11am) I couldn't wait to leave was far from pleasant. [REVIEW_10] Truly awful! I chose this as my birthday lunch place with a friend. The counter clerk/meal maker was disinterested; bordering on rude. This is a small place; so four dirty; unbussed tables are noticeable. After cleaning our own table; we waited and waited. There was no one ahead of us. Finally our paninis were served: both were badly burned. Who serves burned food; unless you just don't care? The salad was bland. The coffee was fine. [REVIEW_11] Waited 1 hour for a simple salad. This place takes forever to bring out your food! The service is slow and horrible.  I had to ask for my salad to go since I had a plane to catch.  When I was able to finally eat my salad; they forgot to put a side of salad dressing; needless to say my salad was awful!  There are plenty of other restaurants you can go to; don't waste your precious time and hard earned money on this dump! [REVIEW_12] i didnt want to give up a star but... the place sucks! [REVIEW_13] Great Cranberry Orange Muffin and Caffe Latte on a Saturday morning. Great ambience and fast service. [REVIEW_14] Little shop  on the corner of Grande and St. Mary's.  Very casual and small shop with a quaint back patio. This is definite WestSide near all the classic food places and it fit they neighborhood well.  Very friendly staff and it gets really busy at lunch time.   Imagine a clean and friendly Native Taco Stand and but it in a small building and you have it; with some nice faith quotes around it.  They have Excellent fry bread; Indian tacos and fry bread with honey or powdered sugar.  You can add meat to your bean taco and the salsa is pretty decent as well.  The prices are listed on the wall and they have daily specials as well.  All the drinks are cans n bottles.    A good place for some good fry bread!! [REVIEW_15] We were here drunk as all heck. after closing time. our guys at larry's hooked us up with leftover cheesesteaks and a meatball. not only was this the best drunk experience of our young lives; but we owe our lives to the workers at larry's. god bless; you have our business for life. thank you and god bless. [REVIEW_16] I purchased a Groupon for a 3-hour cleaning and a three month membership to the Forever Clean Club. I am 2 months into my membership and have only been able to use the service in one out of four attempts. I was understanding after the first cancellation and simply rescheduled my appointment. After the second time; I asked to extend my membership for another month as I had gone a full month without having been able to use it. I was told my membership could not be extended as it was a voucher and I was given a $25 credit to my account for a 'future cleaning' in compensation.   I have now been canceled on a third time. Today I didn't even receive a phone call. I received only an email; though curiously it states that they were ""recently in touch"" to let me know about the cancellation. Perhaps they were confused and were thinking of the last 2 times they cancelled? That aside; the email was sent an hour before the scheduled start time. Apart from the general inconvenience of being cancelled and left with a house that needs to be cleaned; I had left work early (using personal time) and was on my way home to receive the cleaner by the time I saw the e-mail. The e-mail provided no contact information; only links to Facebook and Twitter accounts. I found a phone number on a previous e-mail from one of the client account specialists who had contacted me following a previous cancellation so I called that number. I spoke with a lovely gentleman who confirmed that I have experienced a high number of cancellations. He told me that a member of the Trust and Safety Department was to have contacted me previously to follow up regarding my first 2 cancellations. I let him know that I had received no such call.  He told me that I would receive a call from that department; most likely later today; to hopefully resolve the issue. We'll see if that happens but I know for sure that I will not be recommending you to anyone and I will be contacting the BBB for a resolution if your team doesn't provide a refund for the 'membership' that I have been unable to use.  UPDATE: The company ended up refunding me $20 (I was asking for $30 to cover the cost of the membership I was unable to use) so that was at least something. The person who emailed me apologized and told me that the frequent cancellations were due to limited availability in my area. I find it disingenuous to give that as an excuse after I went to the site; I looked at a calendar of available times for a specific cleaner and chose from those times and was even sent a confirmation. If those times weren't available then they shouldn't be listed. Limited availability; to me; would mean I would have a difficult time booking the appointment in the first place; not be cancelled on at the last minute.   As they are a broker site (which I didn't realize at first) and not the actual provider company; these cleaners accept jobs booked from the site and I assume then cancel if a higher paying opportunity comes up.  If that's the case; there should be a system in place that penalizes the cleaners for canceling (since the consumer is penalized for a last minute cancellation) or better yet does not allow them to book through the site after a certain number of cancellations. [REVIEW_17] Absolutely horrible service; cold soup and my salad was drenched in dressing. The iceberg lettece was browning; soggy and pickled.  This place should not even get 1 star. [REVIEW_18] One reason why the poor review; the way they handled a news release from the New Orleans Sewage and Water Board. We are not to use water to bathe; brush teeth; drink or rinse food. The Wyndham has many foreign tourists here that may not be able to understand the the Special News Release that was put under everyone's door. I did ask for more water and was handed 2 small bottles. They refused to let me check out early. [REVIEW_19] Pretty good food; if you like food poisoning.  Had beef wraps last night. Pretty tasty. A little fatty. Have had diarrhea all day; and others who ate the food with had to skip class because they couldn't leave the bathroom.  When I came in to tell the manager; the staff working the cash register seemed uninterested and said they would relay the message to the manager; and then returned to using their cell phone.   A quick search on the Environmental Health Services website shows reports in the last 3 years include the following MAJOR VIOLATIONS:   11/29/2016 Rodents; insects; birds or animals Hot and cold holding temperatures Hands clean and properly washed; proper glove use Food contact surfaces: clean and sanitized  02/10/2015  Hot and cold holding temperatures Food contact surfaces: clean and sanitized  03/05/2014  Adequate handwashing facilities available and accessible Food contact surfaces: clean and sanitized Hot and cold holding temperatures   I urge anyone to reconsider if they decide to eat at this restaurant. [REVIEW_20] What a disappointment. Not what most expect with jazz bar/dining establishment. Not dark or comfy seating. I got a mojito and I do not think they could spare the mint. They had a sign about a cover charge at 8. They came over and said if we were still there at 8 eating we would be charged. The food was nothing special. It was about equal with Zattarans box foods. The shrimp they served in the jambalaya and gumbo could not be smaller. Service was lacking. They may want to look at improving the food and entertainment to fill their very empty establishment before they focus on a cover charge. To add the music was not worth the five and was not really jazz bar type. The bar was also cheaply done. If they do not change they will be gone in six months.  Hmmm trying to find a positive kids menu was decently priced. [REVIEW_21] After looking at other reviews on Yelp; I had to come here! I also noticed seating seemed limited; but we decided to go at an off hour (even then it was still busy; but we managed to snag a table).   I will say every review that cites this place as being slow in service is spot on - it is slow. I don't think the kitchen is well organized to be honest; and they don't encourage take out orders; which is why they are always so full.   We ordered two lunch combos; one with a Figo pizza; and a caprese salad; the other with a Margherita pizza and a caesar salad. For the beverage we both got the unsweetened iced tea (I wish they had better beverage options!).   The pizzas were both amazing and perfectly balanced; on par with Pizzeria Bianco (though I say Pizzeria Bianco is just a little better). The salads were delicious; but my husband was a little off put by the piece of anchovy on top (on the caesar). Then there was this crusty bread that was complimentary with olive oil (to die for).   At the end of the meal we were given a tiny spoonful of the gelato; I was given sweet cream; my husband hazelnut. We thought the gelato was delicious; but quite frankly we were completely out of room. I think they should lead the visit with a gelato sample (or do a special with dessert OR salad)! Maybe next time!   Overall; I would say the food was excellent; service was ok; but slow and the prices were reasonable! They do need a larger dining room with more staff and a better layout! Time to expand! [REVIEW_22] Finally open; The Livery makes use of the former IPD Horse Livery and is the newest endeavor by the Cunningham Group- the masterminds who brought Mesh; Bru Burger and Union 50 to the Mass Ave area.   Livery features an extensive tequila menu in both of their bars. Yeah; I said two bars. One downstairs and another one upstairs that overlooks a patio that's going to be pretty nice this coming spring.   Menu features small plates..  ceviche; yuca fries and jamon serrano top the appetizers with octopus; choripan and skirt steak make up the more substantial (and higher price point) items.   For my meal I went with the Livery Margarita ($9) made with maestro dobel diamante; Lazaroi triplo; fresh lime juice and agave. Add some salt to the rim and this was pretty tasty!  I also went with the roaster vegetables with chimichuri. A nice and somewhat healthy way to dine.   Valet parking is a must around here unless you happen to be lucky enough to score a parking spot out front or on Mass Ave. if walking; the door is on the north side of the building back a bit.   So happy to be neighbors with this place. My VIP card is going to get a [REVIEW_23] Gypsy Saloon is and has always been one of my favorite restaurants outside of the city. Kim and Marianne are the owners and are totally hands on. Their menu is so fun and amazing. They are always consistent with their food and it has always been my ""go to"". Food is always fresh. The lobster mac and cheese is second to none. A fabulous restaurant not to be missed. Fabulous Brunch; lunch and dinner. You will not be disappointed.....EVER!!!!! [REVIEW_24] Waited 3 hours between buying the tickets and enter to the haunted asylum; it was not scary at all and it just lasts 13 minutes. Not worth it.  While waiting in line; someone started to throw balls and it hit a few people. [REVIEW_25] Pim the chef is amazing!  Just returned from Thailand and I think I like Pim's cooking better!  Thanks Pim! [REVIEW_26] The ineptitude of this company has reached epic proportions.  I will not go into details because I have already spent too many hours of my life mired in the colossal sea of incompetence that is Express Scripts.  If you have any choice at all; do not; DO NOT use this company. [REVIEW_27] Juliet was my lifesaver. I recently moved out of my last house in the suburbs and into a place in the city. I was completely lost in the move and had to start from scratch. Juliet helped me find everything. From doctors offices and referrals to organizing my apartment for the first time. She even helped find a vet for my cat and set up an appointment in less then five minutes from me asking.    Juliet is fast and prompt and even does her work with a warm smile. She knows the city like the back of her hand and can help you with any city needs. I highly recommend using her service. I know I'll be using her again! [REVIEW_28] The worst customer service and nasty employees EVER!!!  SLOW SERVICE!!!Missing items and cashier not giving correct change.  I felt like she wanted my $10.  Manager was no better...nasty and said to call and complain...she did NOT care. NEVER again!!!! [REVIEW_29] This is sort of our secret place for lunch. It has great food; decent prices and the staff is friendly. It's a bit quiet when you walk in; but don't let that throw you off; the food is amazing. :) [REVIEW_30] They used to make an Amiga bowl that had an abundance of shredded grilled chicken on the bottom of a flour tortilla bowl; a layer of rice topped with grilled onions and peppers with a queso sauce drizzeled over the top. Tonight there was no rice nor any shredded chicken; it had been replaced with chicken crisps. They are the outer parts of a grilled chicken breast with no moisture and very few of them. Having met the owner in the past and having his wife wait on me I knew something wasn't right. I explained to the waitress that this dish had changed and wasn't good! She politely offered something else. What to order...if they had modified a basic dish what was next? To my surprise a male manager came out and ""informed"" me that this is exactly what they had been serving for 10 years and I must have either special ordered something or was mistaken. I said this is not what they had served me for the past 5 years and I never had requested a special order before.  I also asked what they had done to the phenominal soft tacos? They were usually served in a soft warm flour tortilla and had moisture and flavor. Tonight they were stale and crisp and the filing was bland.  Again he informed me I was mistaken while he held my order that had been sent back to the kitchen in front of me. I apologized and said I didn't wish for anything else; thank you. Another manager came out a few moments later apologizing and stated that they are unfamiliar with what I had ordered and would ""special order"" anything I wanted. I declined. Apparently their cook walked out tonight and they were winging it. Too bad it was a good place to get a good mexican meal. Two thumbs down on Poblano's.",11
39,"[REVIEW_1] Wouldn't have known this place existed if it wasn't for Yelp. They make very good; authentic vietnamese banh mi sandwiches. I can get over how little they cost. [REVIEW_2] We came last night and order three cup chicken and tofu hot pot and beef noodle and oyster pancake and scallion pancake . The foods was excellent. We will come back again. [REVIEW_3] Terrible service. My friends and I waited at least a half hour for a drink. We were at the FRONT of the bar and were ignored time after time after time!!! We kept waving for the bar tender; however he seemed to be high on his horse and served everyone else but us. We were about to walk over to another bar when he finally asked what we wanted. I told him how long we had been waiting and that we kept waving him down. He disregarded our comment. We just walked away because I did not want to be served by this rude man. There is no place to sit unless you have a VIP table; which is terrible. I've been there twice since they have opened and have not had a good time there. Hire new staff that actually know what guest service is. [REVIEW_4] Amazing rolls. Amazing service. Fun waitresses that like to have a great conversations.   I recommend the all you can eat sushi rolls.    Place gets crowded; so plan accordingly.  I can see why it gets crowded since it's a great value amongst all the overpriced places in the area.   Must visit place if you are in the Reno area. [REVIEW_5] This is one of my favorite stores in the area. I could sit here all day talking about it; but you have to go for yourselves!! If you don't like crowds; don't go lunchtimes as it gets packed. Later in the afternoon is cool. Cheese; meat; wine; bread; olives and oil; the list goes on and on. Its not cheap; but there's Walmart if you want cheap; quality comes at a price I'm afraid!! [REVIEW_6] The food is is fabulous! My husband and I were visiting from Ohio. Chicken and beef were cooked to perfection. Service was great; very clean restaurant in this new area of development. great dining experience. [REVIEW_7] I've been here several times and my cat Toothless is under one of their Wellness Plans. The vet techs and vets are always very nice and helpful when it comes to checking her in; and unless there's a difficult case ahead of me; the check in is always quick and easy. They're also very good about contacting me when someone new or a potential problem comes up; and they call if they need to run any other checks. The price is a little much which is an issue with any vet that I've noticed; but they always treat Toothless very well and I've never had any problems with them. [REVIEW_8] One of my favorite places to eat!  The food is amazing and creative.  Even my meat-loving husband enjoys the food.  I have never had a bad meal here.  My favorites are the nachos and Blue LT. [REVIEW_9] Absolutely amazing! Must get the black garlic wings - they are to die for! My brisket ramen was delicious as well; I can not wait to come back! [REVIEW_10] I love to review a place like Granny's because I prefer to write positive reviews rather than negative ones!   I have been a customer of Granny's for almost 20 years and have never; I repeat NEVER been disappointed!!!   They always get my car in promptly when I need work; they stick to the qoute that they give me and I haven't ever had to take the car back for additional work!   It seems so rare these days to find people in the service industry that take pride in their work.     I have had the opportunity to refer Granny's to several friends and I think that they are all still loyal customers as well. [REVIEW_11] I used to visit the Italian Kitchen every day on my way to work. The staff was always friendly and the food is incredibly good. I have lived in California since 2007 and we still talk about the Italian Kitchen and do our best to pop in when we visit South Jersey. Don't miss their pizza or their hot and cold sandwiches. And don't get me started on the desserts! [REVIEW_12] Despite the fact it's part of a small chain; many locals consider this the best steakhouse in town. Located in the Warwick Hotel; it's certainly one of the most glamorous - leopard-print carpeting; black leather furniture; black-lacquer walls trimmed in gold; and nightly jazz piano and bass duets give it a very 1940s-supper-club ambiance; albeit one that's overlit. The menu is typical - a variety of steaks; chops; salmon; and - of course - prime rib; served in enormous portions along with the usual suspects of sides; like rich creamed spinach and excellent potato skins. If you have any room left; end your meal with fresh strawberries and cream over warm shortbread. The servers will pamper you like few do. Hoping to maintain a touch of class; they require jackets for men at night. If you forget yours; they'll loan you one; although why a man in a well-worn; ill-fitting blazer would look better than one without is beyond me. [REVIEW_13] Great drinks!!! I got the zombie one which was strong and yummy.... Three drinks later and I had to debate whether I was headed down the right path for the night haha! ALSO... give me all the duck fat fries my heart can handle with a side of cheese!!! Next time I'll get the fries with cheese AND short ribs... they were so sinfully good... [REVIEW_14] this steakhouse is very professional; calming and relaxing. staff are nice; they were nice and funny. we will definitely will be coming back here. good choice of menu; food came here quickly and was delicious. the place is so chill; inside was very pleasant looking; our family enjoyed it and we were happy with our visit; will come back here again. [REVIEW_15] Always a great experience ... I come to see the specialist dr bossbaly .... and she is fantastic ... my dog Lillyanna ;has been living a fairly great life with her recommendations ..... and the doctor herself has a great way about her .... the practice is great also ... very helpful and accommodating .....if you want the best and can afford to pay for ; I highly recommend ...... [REVIEW_16] 1. Ambiance-- ehh; it's nice to sit by the fountains; but you have a busy road at your back; so the illusion isn't that great.  2. Rude and unfriendly staff. Every time I go; I feel like they are doing me a favor by serving me or making my coffee. 3. For a plae that boasts itself family-friendly; they sure don't seem to like kids.  4. Pretentious for nothing. It's just not as fancy as they pretend to be.  5. Food is mediocre. Coffees don't taste like coffee. The young girls who work there aren't good baristas. Desserts are lousy. I have never had anything that tastes indulgent. They try to copy the style of the French bakeries in the area and even Whole Foods; but the taste falls flat. They tout their Triple Berry cake as the greatest dessert in town. I'd rather buy Whole Food's berry chantilly cake. At least it's fresh from there. [REVIEW_17] All I can really say is WoW.  The flavors were fantastic.  Quattro Formaggi; Crudo and Sea Salt and Rosemary.  The service was great.  The open pizza area was great to watch these guys at their work.  Beer list is awesome.  What else can I say.  Go.  Eat Pizza the way it should have always been. [REVIEW_18] Great breakfast! Service was wonderful and met one of the ""chicks"". She was delightful to talk to and hear about the restaurant. I had a buckwheat crepe with crab; shrimp and veggies. Topped with an egg! Definitely see the Romanian influence. My wife had French toast and loved it. [REVIEW_19] Several friends and I continued our mini-pub crawl of mixology bars (begun at Franklin Mortgage and Investment Co.) here. Good move!  We parked it at the bar and got the show from Sasha; the bartender; who kept up friendly banter with us even as she concocted a variety of beverages throughout the course of our stay.   The cocktail menu was fairly extensive; broken down into Prohibition- and Repeal-era drinks; not to mention long lists of bourbons; ryes; and scotches. I ordered an Aviation (a drink I make myself; with my own brandied cherries; but here they do it the right way; all out with Creme de Violette to tint it blue like the sky; Sasha let me take a look at the bottle; perhaps to know that it wasn't some awful curacao!)  For another friend she created a drink with Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction's Root liqueur (which is made with the roots and herbs used in old-fashioned root beer); chocolate bitters; seltzer and orange.   We also partook of food here: First; duck fat fries (which have been a trend in Chicago; where I live; for at least a year; but I'd never had them; I'd never eaten anything involving duck before this; so now I suppose I have lost my duck fat innocence). These were thick-cut; rich in taste [gratis the duck fat; one presumes]; not actually greasy; but definitely better when ordered with the cup of cheese sauce on the side.   We also got soft pretzel sticks; which would have been fine but not especially remarkable without the mustard sauce (which had a distinct taste of raspberry; to my mind) pooled in the cup underneath them.  Overall; this was a friendly place with fab drinks and great food. I wish it was in my city. [REVIEW_20] Looking for a solid pizza joint in our new city. Ordered a cheese and a Greek white pizza for delivery. Pizza was delicious; chewy and slightly sweet crust; and delivery was fast! Consistent and not pretentious. [REVIEW_21] I have heard about this place for a few weeks now and have been meaning to visit- and I am very glad that I did!  This place reminds me of a restaurant you would find in DTSP.  Between the wood walls; wood crafted tables and Edison bulbs; this is a great addition to the northern Pinellas county area!  It is small and quaint with local beers on tap and a nice selection of wine (our server told us they are looking to expand into vacant store next door and add a full liquor bar within the next year).  Right off the bat; we had a warm welcome.    The menu is smaller; which means they pretty much perfect the dishes they do make.  We had some beer and wine and went to town on the appetizers:  sack of potatoes (with bacon butter! That literally comes in a small sack....of potatoes); pork skins (who doesn't love fried pork fat?!) deviled eggs topped with fried chicken and caviar (I am not personally a caviar fan; so I just took it off) and their hot chicken boneless wings (with beet kimchi and hot buttermilk sauce; aka my FAVORITE)  I personally loved the joint; and will definitely be coming back to try that lamb burger that kept eyeballing me. [REVIEW_22] Great community vibe... i've run into friends and struck up conversation with new ones each time i've been in.  Its nice to have new hang within walking distance of my house.  I've stuck to the classic burger and love it... everything from the buns to the ketchup is made in-house and has unique taste. The bar had pretty much whatever i wanted... last night the bartenders made some homespun watermelon concoction.  To touch on some other reviews... i understand everyone has a different experience; but to say the place is 'too hipster' seems like someones still jaded from feeling left out in high school...  and personally attacking the owner is tasteless and has no place in a review.  We should be glad we don't all have someone looking over our shoulder attacking our motives. I like what Burger Up is trying to do and i like that they hired a bunch of folks representative of our Nashville community... if you need a non-musician wait staff who dresses just like you and takes you to prom; you're probably in the wrong town. [REVIEW_23] Great bar/café! Such a great place to hang; inside is beautiful and outside you can hear nice music while having a coffee and a cig! Definitely coming back! Loved it [REVIEW_24] Ordered curried chicken; teriyaki; and some eggrolls with soup...I never got that order  This was my first and last time ordering food from here. Delivery was quick; I'll give them that; but the order was wrong. When I called in they said I can have a free meal on them for the mistake.  I said; okay ""I want that free meal now"" (they also offer free delivery for orders over 12.00$) my food came out to 14.87$; 18.87$ with tip.   They refused multiple times (like it'll make a difference if they bring it now or tomorrow; either way it was a lie to get me off the phone). I informed her that if she didn't send her delivery guy back I'll dispute the amount paid to them with my bank; and they'll lose a new customer.   Normally if one thing in my order was wrong I wouldn't mind at all. It's because my entire order was Wong... [REVIEW_25] I have worked with many different companies in the area; and although I have found a few that are somewhat credible; it wasn't until I found Family Air that I found one that wasn't also trying to sell me something I didn't need. They have very reasonable prices; are trustworthy; and can come out much quicker than many companies. I definitely will be calling them again when my a/c unit needs servicing. [REVIEW_26] Absolutely horrible food. The place was dirty and smelled. I ate here once and never again. Not too mention staff was very rude and unprofessional. Dont waste your time or money. I wouldn't even give one star... [REVIEW_27] I really enjoy coming here for dinner.  The service is great and the food is spectacular.  I always feel like I get my monies worth here. [REVIEW_28] Great place to go for an inexpensive byte. They have a few locations throughout New Orleans; polite staff great quick service. They do have beer. Love their burgers and fries. Excellent seafood. Plenty of parking. [REVIEW_29] Beautiful and clean! Our first time visiting and I was impressed with the whole facility !  Very nice rooms and ours had a balcony that over looked the gardens.  We enjoyed strolling through the gardens; boat ride; wonderful dinner at a Mexican restaurant; listening to a band play and taking pictures ! We will definetly plan on a trip back here ! [REVIEW_30] I was very excited to try this place. Went at 2:30 on Saturday. They are supposed to open at 2. After ordering; my friend and I were told that ""nothing was prepped"" and it would be 25 more minutes. We said we did not mind waiting. We waited an hour but nothing was ever ""prepped""; except Mac and cheese or charcuterie. We had the charcuterie and left. There was no attempt to make things right or explain. Very strange experience and poor/ no customer service. The waiter was nice though; and I felt sorry for him.",25
40,"[REVIEW_1] BEST ICE CREAM. Why? -soooo many flavors -Unique flavors are creative and taste better than you would think -Classic flavors better than any chain ice cream shop -good price -fun atmosphere -big scoops! [REVIEW_2] Everyone is friendly; things are easy to find and the staff is informative and knowledgeable.  A great place to relax in peace and quiet [REVIEW_3] A diverse selection of great wines; beautiful scenery; live music; and surprisingly tasty brick oven pizza. What's not to love?   Seriously; this place seemed like one surprise after another. I enjoyed their Barbera and Cabernet Sauvignon; while my lady liked the White Merlot and Spuma Rossa best. Even the spanakopita was way better than it had any right to be. If there's a nicer winery in this area; I haven't tried it yet. Put this one on your must try list! [REVIEW_4] We ate breakfast here twice so far and great food; prices are very reasonable! Biscuits & gravy; omelette; home fries; French toast are all great choices. Leigh was our waitress; very nice to talk to! [REVIEW_5] I have been to this restaurant at least five times and have never been disappointed. They have the best grilled cheese in the city - complete with beets and mustard (sounds strange but don't judge until you've tried it)! Their creamy grits are tremendous as well. Overall; in a city that doesn't do breakfast so well; this place will satisfy every craving! [REVIEW_6] This place has everything you need for buying gifts; and plenty of stuff you don't need (or didn't know you needed until you see it). It's got all the knick-knacks a person could ever want; which makes it the perfect place to purchase fun gifts. From candles to jewelry; locally made shirts and wallets to posters; prints; and coffee mugs; this place is the perfect place to peruse on a visit to Mass Ave or the perfect spot to stop for a gift for a host; birthday; graduation; or anything else.   I was tempted to think that I'd be able to find things in the store that I wanted and order them online cheaper; but Silver in the City already has good prices (with shipping; few things were cheaper online). I love it here! [REVIEW_7] I live near Baltimore but get to Philly occasionally.  When I do; I try to get to Nicks.  Roast beef with cheese and gravy fries... Y U M M Y !  Good service; casual environment; and really good food. [REVIEW_8] This is so perfect for Manayunk; especially for those of us on the go to be able to grab a quick healthy snack. It's always clean and the staff is always friendly. Sometimes the flavors aren't my favorite; but I love being creative so I find a way to make it work for what my mood is that day!!! Love this place!!! [REVIEW_9] Awesome place for the guys to get a haircut.  All the barbers were friendly and eager very eager to cut the next customers hair. Highly recommend going here. [REVIEW_10] Buckingham Pizza makes the best pizza around; particularly its plain pizza and a few of its specialities -- try the cool ranch pizza. This is a pizza parlor. Don't get fancy....order the pizzas and maybe some sides. While some of the entrees are good (chicken piccata); stay with the pizza and you'll love it. [REVIEW_11] Big respect for baileys range for keeping the beer selection local. As a craft beer hunter I am usually happy to find 1 beer on a menu that I have never heard of. Today my mind was blown as a traveler looking at this tap lineup. I have seriously only seen 3 of the 30 beers they have on tap! I wish I could spend a few days working my way through them. If you love beer and your traveling through St. Louis you need to come here. The food is great too. [REVIEW_12] I rarely leave reviews but this is my new fave place. Its not your typical greasy pizza place. They actually have some healthy options...and get this- the healthy options actually taste good. *gasp* I dined in when they were just 3 days old and the decor is eye-catching but not distracting. More importantly; the food is PHENOMENAL. I order takeout about once (sometimes twice...oops) a week. I have not had a bad meal yet. I'm working on trying different things on the menu but I have a few staples already- their hand cut Jersey fries; the mild wings; and the crust and fire bowl. I had their truffle burger last week and it was AMAZING. I've become a regular customer very quickly...I love this place. [REVIEW_13] i decided to try this place after a ""soup nazi"" type of lunch experience i had there in the fall. (aside from the diva-ness; i wasn't incredibly wow'ed by my meal.)  i went for dinner with a friend since she had never been to this restaurant. as always; the decor is awesome; i like the clean semi-cramped feeling.   on to the food...  i had the watermelon salad and the roasted bell pepper with lentils. OMG! i would choose this meal as my pre-execution fare if i were on death row.  first off; the watermelon salad was ridiculously delicious. there were pieces of watermelon; some radishes; some other vegetable that i can't recall right now; and slices of some unpronounceable white cheese. those ingredients are kind of exciting on their own but what set that dish apart was the freaking oil-based dressing. i don't know what they put on top of that salad but it just made the whole dish come together.  the roasted bell pepper was ENORMOUS. i didn't realize how big and filling that dish would be. the bell pepper had some mix of lentils; raisins?; cheese; and whatever extra deliciousness the chef decided to throw in to blow my mind. accompanying the bell pepper was some kind of tomato ragout with a dollop of soft; i'm guessing; goat cheese. whatever it was it complimented the bell pepper fantastically.  all told; the total cost wasn't ridiculous for both items (i think i paid almost 40 usd with tax and tip.)   given this experience; that chef can be soup nazi if he wants. [REVIEW_14] Little shop  on the corner of Grande and St. Mary's.  Very casual and small shop with a quaint back patio. This is definite WestSide near all the classic food places and it fit they neighborhood well.  Very friendly staff and it gets really busy at lunch time.   Imagine a clean and friendly Native Taco Stand and but it in a small building and you have it; with some nice faith quotes around it.  They have Excellent fry bread; Indian tacos and fry bread with honey or powdered sugar.  You can add meat to your bean taco and the salsa is pretty decent as well.  The prices are listed on the wall and they have daily specials as well.  All the drinks are cans n bottles.    A good place for some good fry bread!! [REVIEW_15] Finding a place where I can take my daughter whose is gluten and dairy intolerant and a vegetarian and picky as hell is impossible. These guys make the impossible possible. She was thrilled and everything I ate was fantastic. For those non-vegetarian non-gluten free and non-dairy free you'll love it.   I had biscuits and gravy with a side of pork sausage. You must try this. One of the best biscuits and gravy I have ever had.   The owners are a truly nice couple. Go out of your way to eat here. It's worth it. [REVIEW_16] This was surprisingly the best meal I have ever had.  Some things to know if you go and to avoid being asked to leave Sam's house:   1)  Check pretentiousness and indecisiveness at the door.  2)  Know what you want to order; he will tell you how to modify it accordingly 3)  If you go close to closing time or try to rush him; you will be asked to leave 4)  Sushi for everyone; that is why his prices are so reasonable.   5)  Everyone at one time?  Everyone will be asked to leave.  If you try to bring a huge group you will be asked to leave 6)  Get ready for a enlightening experience....  This is a very unique place because it is so unassuming. You would not go to Burger King and throw a tantrum because they did not have a Delmonico steak.  However; whatever Sam deciedes to serve to you; he will ""make it your way""  Sam Katakura knows what he is doing when he compares his sushi to the kind you buy at the grocery store.  He does not pretend to be something he is not; afterall; it is called ""Sam's sushi bar"" The food is satisfying; consistent; and good.  He will engage you in conversation and will leave you satisfied and wanting more. [REVIEW_17] Me and my family went yesterday. We ordered 12 donuts. All different. We didn't know that you couldn't order with two toppings bc they only can ""hold one topping"" ... the donuts where made fresh and topped to order. They were amazing. They did take a little longer because they are fresh but we made it just before a rush. They were warm and GREAT! Would highly recommend... a little bit more expensive than dunkin but worth it. I'm not normally a cake donut (no yeast here) fan but these are a treat! [REVIEW_18] This location is very easy to find off of Street Rd. I had called a couple of other tire shops that stated it would be a 3 to 4 hour wait; which I didn't have time for. I called them to see how long the waiting time was and they stated they could get me right in. I arrived within 10 minutes; and true to the word they pulled my car right in. I was working at a local car show and have to get back ASAP! Within minute they found the issue; valve stem and fixed at a very responsible price. This shop is a very friendly and helpful; and willing to go the extra mile to help on short notice. The shop was nice a clean and will ran. I would highly recommend them; I did not buy tires; but I did get a repair which they complete with ease. They could have tried to pull me into replacing the tire; in stead of repairing; which I've had shops in the past try to do. Thank you for your great service. [REVIEW_19] Dr Borst is a great guy....  we have had our pet with him from birth to death... Putting a dog or cat down is a pretty rough thing to have to do..  but I would  not want to go anywhere else for this sad event because of the staff and Dr Borst. they make it as painless as possible...... [REVIEW_20] The plan was to find a one-of-a-kind engagement ring. I had no prior history or knowledge of jewelry; especially not engagement rings. Foolishly I visited a handful of those cookie cutter mall shops. Boring. Pricey. Nothing special. Blah.  A co-worker told me about Gemological Resources Inc (GRI) and the wonderful experience he and his now wife had with them. Since it was a local shop I gave them a shot not knowing what to expect. Wow.... What a great experience!   From the moment we (my girlfriend and I) walked into GRI; it felt right. We met with Terry initially to get a feel for GRI's work; as well as to discuss ring options.Terry is an encyclopedia of knowledge; it was a true lesson on everything we needed to know about diamonds; rings; etc. Very much worth taking the time to meet with him. He not only shared much of his knowledge; but also listened and got a good feel for what my girlfriend liked. The initial meet was a success and I felt confident that GRI would be the right place to go once I was ready to make the decisive move solo.  When the time came I met up with GRI again; this time with Nirali who works closely with Terry. Because I wanted a unique; special; one-of-a-kind engagement ring I decided on a custom design ring. The CAD images and designs were perfect! To top it off; Nirali found me a high quality and very well priced diamond; this after I spent weeks personally searching for the right diamond. I was sold!!   A reasonable deposit and a couple of weeks later the ring was finally in. Wow oh wow!! It was perfect! 100X better than anything I've seen before. GRI knocked it out of the park! Seriously! Fast forward a few months later.... My wife loves her ring and goes goo goo over it everyday. We had our bands done by GRI as well and they too are perfect (the wife's band was also custom designed to match the engagement ring).  All in all it was a GREAT outcome. We are both so very pleased and happy about our experience with GRI. Beyond our expectations. Never have I had such a relaxing and pleasant experience. I truly mean it. It always felt like I was meeting with friends and not just a standard business transaction.   So do yourself a favor... If you're reading this it's because you're thinking about buying jewelry. Save yourself the hassle. GO DIRECTLY TO GRI. I highly recommend them. [REVIEW_21] Most under-rated brewery on this list. Sun King is garbage. It's just popular from publicity and ads. Granite City has amazing food as well. Keep away from their mixed drinks. Their margaritas are a joke. Downtown location is better than Carmel. [REVIEW_22] I have groen up eating Italian food and i have not come across a more legit place than Mazzaros! Love their sauce and meatballs. [REVIEW_23] Excellent food and quick; responsive service. We had a party of 12 and sat right next to the tank. The oyster appetizer was delicious and so were my shrimp and grits. When we are back in the area we will return again. Everyone in our party loved it. [REVIEW_24] Awesome sushi! We've been looking for the best sushi around the area for a long time and finally we found it! We were impressed with everything. One thing better than the other one. We got the Jalapeño popper; Suno Mono; Spicy Kani salad; Samurai roll; Masami roll and deep fried banana for dessert. [REVIEW_25] PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST MIDDLE EASTERN / MEDITERRANEAN FOODS! HE JUST PILES IT ON AND IT'S JUST AMAZING! THE MAN KNOWS HOW TO WORK A CART!  TIP: + You do not get to choose what you get. Only one item on the menu and it's always a little different from the last time. + Long wait so get there early or later during lunch time. + Used to be $5 now it's $10 i believe. + One order per person. + Cash only + He's a warm friendly guy so have a conversation with him while he prepares your order. + You will smell like the food you ate for the next day or two but it's worth it! + You will have food coma if you attempt to eat it all in one sitting. + He's got piles of garlic and flowers on his cart which is cool. + You can smell his food cart from a block away. [REVIEW_26] Not sure what else to say that others haven't said already.  They have excellent Italian baked goods; a small bit of grocery items; and they make outstanding sandwiches at their deli counter! [REVIEW_27] Definitely a local joint. The atmosphere is great with local art all over the walls. Service was excellent! And the food...OMG so amazing! Wish we had one back home! [REVIEW_28] Decided to look for a nice place for dinner near the beach on a recent business trip that offered low carb options; as both my associates were following a paleo diet. Found a wonderful selection of steak and seafood here and great reviews on Yelp; so we decided to give 1200 a try. When we arrived; we found a warm atmosphere with a wait that was relatively short for the dinner hour (about 20 minutes.) The service was excellent and we especially enjoyed the bacon wrapped scallops as an appetizer. I ordered the ribeye; which was outstanding. The food tasted delicious and fresh. I would recommend 1200 Chophouse for anyone looking for a warm; friendly and  delicious dining experience. One note; parking was a bit scarce on the property; but we were able to find parking close by. [REVIEW_29] My wife and I loved everything about this diner. The decor is lovely & the food was great. I had the cheese steak and it was much better than Geno's.  Our server was awesome [REVIEW_30] Good food; fresh and you can taste the quality. Good service as well. Went here at 7:30 on a Saturday night and walked right in. Was pretty dead but probably because there's so much going on in the city; State Fair; Symphony on the Prairie; etc. Had the Charleston BLT; which is a crab cake BLT. Crabcake was huge; all meat; and tasted house made. Spinach and artichoke dip was good as well. Easy parking.",30
41,"[REVIEW_1] One of (if not) the best pizza places around. The chicken bacon rancher pizza is the best and beats any other kind of place that sells it. Boneless wings are also pretty good. [REVIEW_2] I had a service associate named Jacob . I came in for a safety and emissions test. I was quoted up to 2 hours.it only took 60 min. From the minute I walked in to the minute I walked out the service and knowledge was impeccable . His findings and suggestions were offered and not pushed. This service makes me want to come back ! Jacob def deserves more than just acknowledgement by corporate and his store. I believe great service (on a Saturday to!!) can be rare to find . [REVIEW_3] I would recommend Twisted Twig to everyone - excellent service; very friendly; and create amazing arrangements!  You will not regret working with Jen! I reached out to a few different florist 2 weeks before my wedding. I was frantic my wedding was only 2 weeks away and didn't have a florist; even though it was a small wedding. I got a hold of Jen; who I might say was very responsive.  I got on the phone with Jen and she was so nice and very genuine. We spoke about what I was looking for and I texted her some pictures of inspiration and my dress. She asked me if there were certain flowers I was looking for and my budget. I didn't have any flowers in mind; as long as the colors are what I wanted and told her my budget. She sent me a quote; staying within my budget; noting the flowers she would use for the bouquet; boutonniere; and floral arrangements for the arch I had. It was nice that Jen works with you to stay in your budget yet still get what you want.  On the wedding day; Jen arrived at my hotel door right on time with my beautiful bouquet. The floral arrangements at the site was gorgeous also. Jen really hit the mark on what I wanted for my wedding. She also was very sweet and added some roses on the chairs by the aisle to my surprise; which was not on the quote. That was very special because it pulled the whole ceremony look together and I felt Jen really wanted everything to look perfect for me. [REVIEW_4] This is my first time coming to this establishment I was very impressed with the people the cooks the cashier; customers ;everyone was just very nice and just a really good feel of the place felt like home. I purchased a volcano Burger it was excellent. Sweet potato fries were done just right. And a black and white shake that was so thick and creamy I wanted to go get another one. Very impressed with this place I will be back [REVIEW_5] Warning; if you come here on a Sunday there is a set tasting menu.  We were a party of two; they served us with one plate; ""family style"".  The only problem is the woman next to us was a party of one and had the same size servings.  They are claiming family style but giving the same portions they give to one person to multiple people. My advice; make sure you request being served as one person with separate plates.  The food was delicious but the business aspect was unacceptable.  Will not come back. [REVIEW_6] I had a GREAT experience at this salon. David was my stylist and even though I was rather easy breezy and not to definite on what I wanted; he pulled it off really well. I went in wanting a brown to gray ombre with the attitude of ""stylist knows best"" and I'm GLAD I did. I have extremely long hair and I was there for a LONG time lifting color but it was no bother at all. Everyone was very nice to me and David worked me in (I went over the time I had scheduled since my hair is  so long) when other customers came in for appointments but I never felt like I was ignored at all.   My hair came out a beautiful golden and silver ombre and while I had originally thought I wanted a drastic dark to gray this was SO MUCH better than I imagined. I'm so happy I trusted Daivd to do what he does best. I have received so many compliments on the color and even the cut he gave (I'm not very willing to cut my long hair so he shaped it perfectly)!  I will definitely be back for haircut; toning; and after care!   I was shocked by the great price as well! I had asked around other salons and some people refused me; saying my hair would never get what I wanted (without seeing me) or that it would be upwards of $400 to cover the bleaching and dying PLUS haircut. They were over 1/2 that price here and worth EVERY penny. 10/10 would dye again [REVIEW_7] Amazing. Can't go wrong with this place.   Tried something new every time I come and nothing disappoints.   Shakes are a must; too! [REVIEW_8] Farm to table done right! Glad Dandelion was packed so we discovered this. The food was very flavorful; the fresh ingredients really popped. We had Saturday brunch; will definitely return to try the regular menu. [REVIEW_9] I asked for a manicure gel nail and this is what I get. The paint is so sloppy and  did not clean around my nail whatsoever . I had to paid $40 for this; never going back there. [REVIEW_10] I first want to start off with the fact of how much I love Blaze Pizza. I've been here mmmmm about ten times. Well not this exact location; but nevertheless to Blaze Pizza. Tonight's occasion was Friday pizza night with the kids. What made it even more fantastic was the buy one get one free coupon I retrieved from Facebook. I ended up seeing a friend here who also had the coupon. Before I ordered our food I made sure to ask the cashier; Amanda; if it was buy one get one free for all pizzas or per order. She stated for all pizzas. I went ahead and ordered and added my friends order to ours; just to be nice. Once it was time to check out; the same cashier then said no; you can only have one per order. I purposely ordered four pizzas based one what she told me. I was of course puzzled and frustrated. She then turned to who she called the ""general manager"" and said I can only do one right and he said yes without even looking into what was going on. I tried to get his attention but he ignored me. He was a little busy I will add but when something is happening; tend to it. I told her ma'am I only did it this way because of what you told me but of course she acted oblivious. Totally upset me but I decided to just leave with the bill we were given. I was really upset not because of what happened but because of how it was handled. Rudely and unprofessional! [REVIEW_11] My experience here was all around very positive. My waitress was extremely attentive and helpful; from explaining many menu items individually and catering to our table as if we were the only ones there.   I ordered the nachos and Mexican corn as my appetizers. The nachos came in huge portions and very stuffed with cheese; jalapeños etc. So delicious! The Mexican corn was very flavorful and not too spicy; which I really appreciated.  The table came with complimentary chips and salsa which was very light and appropriate before starting the meal. A nice touch. Chips could've been more salty but overall everything was still fine as the salsa gave good flavor.  I ordered the enchiladas which were a bit too bean-y for my taste.   Great service and nice; clean atmosphere. Food is terrific. I would definitely recommend! [REVIEW_12] My family and I were visiting Nashville; staying in the Hillsboro-Belmont area. It was our last night and after sighting and non stop go go go for several days we wanted a quiet/easy takeout night. My grandmother said she wanted a burger and when Nana wants a burger; she gets a burger. We chose this place because it was close and we were blown away. The place was busy and crowded but that is always a sign of great things to come. The bartenders were very friendly with all guests; not just regulars. I wish I knew the name of the gentleman who took my order; cause he got my order completely right off memory save one thing and had me check the receipt for any missed modifications. We got our food home and devoured it. The ketchup that I didn't even ask for; but was included was  fantastic and homemade. I can't say enough how I much I enjoyed my experience and the food. [REVIEW_13] I have been going to Bakery House for years and absolutely love it every time! I usually get the chocolate chip cake- it's my favorite! [REVIEW_14] Very fresh ingredients with an authentic taste. Priced per taco to mix and match- which I prefer. Would definitely come back for my next taco fix! [REVIEW_15] Mailed a poster-specifically asked the guy to tape the c ends of the poster tubes- he said he would -well the package arrived to the recipient empty-went to file claim-the owner seemed disinterested  in helping me-in fact it seemed he had no clue about anything -no urgency  in providing any customer service- it's been a month and I've been back and forth trying to get a resolution -not a one of the people seem to know anything ; follows up on the situation -I've  done everything  I've  been asked to do and provide-terrible service-im about to lose my shit - it's maddening -DO YOUR JOB-IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE [REVIEW_16] Fair warning; this is gonna be a long one; involving multiple locations and Southwest's ""Customer Service"".    I was heading out this past Thursday to make my cousin's HS graduation in east TX.  My first warning this would be the trip from hell was a text warning me of a delay in Tucson (TUS).  I live an hour & a half east of TUS; but decided to leave the house as originally planned to ensure I could speak to a gate agent.    My layover was to be 45 minutes in Denver; yet the delay was already 55 minutes due to weather according to the SW gate agent in TUS.  I was quickly informed I wouldn't make my Denver (DEN) departure.  What ensued was a crazy spider web of options having me fly to LAX; staying overnight in DEN; flying to Houston; then Dallas Love Field (DAL); my final destination...arriving at 5:45pm; with a 7pm graduation to make two hours away.  No Go!  Finally the gate agent said; ""Can you drive to Phoenix?...there's a flight leaving at 7:40pm.""  Realizing I had a nearly two hour drive; she quickly changed my flight & I hauled butt off-site to pick up my car & drive to PHX.   During the drive I realized the gate agent hadn't rescheduled my return flight & my car would be parked in PHX.  I quickly parked at the closest lot so I could speak to a gate agent; the parking later costing me $75 for a three day stay.  I stood for 45 minutes while the poor gate agent; Nancy; tried every way she could to reschedule my return flight so I could reunite with my car.  The system repeatedly gave her error messages & she couldn't even check in a stroller for two dazed parents.  All her calls to her supervisor yielded no physical response.  Nancy did her best; calling everyone she could & finally informed me ""for future reference; ensure the original agent changes your return flight too.""  A tad too late in this instance & I just had to board the plane; resorting to a Facebook post that yielded a possible ride from TUS to get my car in PHX; something I didn't want to use.  Nancy entered some notes & told me to call the 1-800-I-FLY-SWA customer service number to reschedule once in Texas.   Sadly; this was the tip of the iceberg.    The flight; pilots & flight attendants were wonderful.  I arrived 55 minutes later than my original flight; thankful the rental car company was still available.  What was terrible was the website & lack of customer service at FLY SWA.   Over two days I called eight times; spending a total of 4 hours; 18 minutes & 49 seconds desperately trying to get a human on the line.  As a tip - SW get some decent Muzak!  I stayed up til 4am freaking out because no one would respond; despite two messages saying I would get a call back in 15 minutes and 7 minutes; respectively.  I made two Facebook posts; even messaging them; with FB communications rep Lindsey no help.  During one hour+ session on hold I did a Google search & discovered that SW's website had gone into ""meltdown"" & their phone lines were overwhelmed due to their recent low fare sale.  Sure enough; I checked the website; & was booted off repeatedly.  I was in full-on panic now because it showed I had no upcoming flights; listing my departure was on my original TUS flight; with my return the rescheduled flight out of PHX - stupid considering this would've meant that I was in the air at the same time on two separate flights!  It was a very sleepless night imagining I was going to have to book another very expensive; short-notice; flight just to get back to my car.   Finally my cousin said ""to hell with SW; let's go to Walmart & buy some wine!""  Once again; I was on the phone; on hold buying a kiddie pool & booze when an angel named Rhonda finally answered.  24 minutes later I finally had a direct return flight to PHX; with a three hour drive home when I returned.  I have always loved the flight crews & agents at SW.  I love that they give snacks on the plane & their in-flight cocktails are reasonably priced.  But this was a very stressful ""adventure"" I don't ever want to repeat.  After all was said & done; Rhonda informed me I somehow have a miraculous credit of $133 I must use in the next two months.  I am searching for a brave soul to purchase the ticket for since I really don't want to fly SW ever again.  Sadly; SW is typically more expensive than other carriers; particularly since I rarely need to check a bag; & if I do; it's always free since I'm in the military. In addition; there's no assigned seating for the extra cost.  (As a comedian once said ""Ever fly Southwest?...One thru Forty...GO!!!"")  I might also add that most other carriers will let military pre-board; while Southwest does not.    I sincerely hope my experience this past weekend was a rare one & dedicated flyers fare better than I. [REVIEW_17] Our family's favorite place for breakfast.  The hashbrowns are the reason to go... along with the Eggs Provencale.  My son loves the french toast with fresh strawberries so much; he eats an adults serving; no problem.  Visit the attached bakery for some of the best pastries in Tucson.   It could be a scary location for non-Tucson natives; but don't fret.  This kind of weird setting (in a ghetto strip mall; next to a crappy Safeway) is what Tucson is all about.  You won't be disappointed! [REVIEW_18] If you're white and dance to EDM don't bother coming here.   The tall (6'6""+) african-american bouncer kicked me out when I came out of the bathroom; after I had been there for only 2 songs; saying ""I need to talk to you outside"" then proceed to say ""girls are complaining you're dancing up on them"" I have a strict policy of NOT dancing up on girls or even initiating eye contact! (I have a firm opinion that most[not all] girls in clubs are attention whores; gold diggers and snobs - as such I do not go there for them! I go to have a good time enjoying the music). Obviously this accusation was complete BS. I can only assume the bouncers hater homies were not happy at all on the crowd of girls who circled up around me when I started getting down. I asked to speak to the manager who tried to pass off some BS excuses for his employees misbehavior and invited me back in; but my cab had already arrived to take me away from this POS; likewise I refused to come back into the club. The manager proceeded to tell me ""I don't care about Yelp or TripAdvisor reviews"" when I informed him I write online reviews  ... LOL! OK .. so what I have to say back here on the internet is: good luck bud. I won't be back & have a lovely career seeing as you don't understand the power of the internet! We yelpers stick together.  Piece of advice guy: don't let your employees play favorites with your patrons; I hope your club works out for the best... bon voyage!  I will spend my $$$;$$$.$$ (hint; hint) elsewhere like at the Push Ultra Lounge where I wont get discriminated against for being male; tall; white and cheered on by attractive females.  Sorry your bouncers homies cant dance to EDM (maybe they should go hang out at The Kennedy in Tampa - hehehe) & have a nice life! [REVIEW_19] I really love this place and I haven't quite figured out why...  The bathroom is usually pretty nasty; and slowly but surely they're replacing all the music on the jukebox with bland soft rock bands...  But above all this are two words that give me gastological goosebumps:  SPANISH FRIES  And if you've had them (with melted cheddar of course; not that greezy spray-on cheese) you'll know why they deserve all capitals and a separate paragraph...effin' amazing. jalapeno peppers; cooked onions; melted cheddar; and old bay...this much fried goodness should be one of the seven deadly sins...  On top of that the hurricanes and pink lemonades margaritas kick-ass (get a double; it's more like a triple...boo-yah!!); the pomegranate margarita is quite delctable as well; in fact its hard to go wrong with their flavored margaritas....on second thought stay away from the mango; it kinda reminds me of cough syrup with a lollipop left in it  They added a downstairs which helps with overflow; but lacks the bright open airiness of upstairs; and kind of feels like being on punishment when all of the cool (and early) people hog up the space by the upstairs bar. But fret not; the food is just as good and the drinks are never weak.  Flat screens that often show soccer; occasional live music; and a fun local crowd (especially on Monday) who refuse to let another neighborhood joint be bastardized by UPenn students (they can all have MarBar!); now it's all coming back to me why I love this place... [REVIEW_20] Still can't say enough about this place after all the times I've been here.   Great atmosphere to come and watch a game; have some drinks; and enjoy some good food... Yes; it's all typical bar food; but you can't go wrong with anything on the menus. They're pizza is remarkably good for a bar; and is actually one of the better pizzas in town; in my opinion.   The staff here is always great; and very accommodating. If there's a game you want on; they'll put it on for you immediately.   Great beer selection. Tons of stuff you're familiar with; plus a ton of local brews that are sure to please.   If you're looking for somewhere to enjoy a game with some great company and good atmosphere; this is your place. [REVIEW_21] SO GOOD!  My friends and I came here after a long day rock climbing on Mt Lemmon. The owner (I think?) was incredibly nice and helpful.  But most importantly the food was amazing! Especially for the price; we are all college students so its basically our number one goal to find quality; cheap food. I ordered the Beef Gyro with ""greek fries""; which I would suggest %100. They were seasoned so well; with lemon and other things I couldn't name. I was just so impressed by this small; modern; simple yet incredibly delicious Greek restaurant. Ive worked in very fancy restaurants; yet I would direct anyone to ZOE Mediterranean instead of McMahons or other overpriced menus.   As we were finishing up our meal; the owner brought out some free; fresh hummus and pita bread; saying; ""You should have told me you are starving students! Next time just let us know and we will give you a free snack"" We all agreed it was an amazing spot and proceeded to tip as well as we could.   I would highly recommend this; if you are ever hiking; camping; climbing; wandering near Catalina Highway; eat here! Or just make your way to this area; I would seriously say its worth it. [REVIEW_22] Their sushi burrito was nowhere near as good as the photo suggested. Plus;  the staff seemed clueless and out of half of the ingredients.  I'll never go back. [REVIEW_23] Horrible experience; pizza was soggy and cold when I received it; took 2 hours until I actually received my order as well. Absolutely no communication on my order; even after calling twice. Once I finally received the pizza I called to get my money back; which was communicated that I would not be charged; soon to find out that I was charged the very next day. I highly recommend never ordering from here; service was horrible and they were extremely rude. I won't be ordering from here again and either should you. [REVIEW_24] this place is worth the wait on weekends. the biggest problem with this place is trying to figure out what yummy food to try this time [REVIEW_25] I would not recommend this hotel as my experience here was not the best experience as my room was accessed and items stolen.  Not a safe place to stay! [REVIEW_26] One of my favorite restaurants in the Fairmont area.  Zorba's is a BYOB with traditional Greek dishes. The prices are reasonable as well. They have an appetizer sampler which is really good and filling in of itself. As a fan of lamb; I've tried several of the stewed dishes and never been let down.  It's a quaint restaurant you should definitely try out. [REVIEW_27] We've eaten here several times and the food has always been just delicious! 4 of us went this past Tuesday and the food was a knock out! I felt like I was in the DR!! We each had a different dish so we could try it all and it was all delicious! Shrimp was perfect; oxtail was amazing ( I'm a fan of oxtail and this is best ever!) goat was served in a rich broth that was not greasy and the best of the best was the whole fried snapper!!! It was so good; I that if I closed my eyes; I could easily be in the Caribbean!!  Awesome! I can't wait to go back and try the chicken and rice; the ropa vieja and those amazing empanadas! Oh; did I mention the reasonable price?  A very nice evening and a 5 star Caribbean experience; right here in 'ol St Louis! [REVIEW_28] Probably my least favorite thing I did in New Orleans. It was a boring boat tour with a guide that had the strangest accent. It felt like he was slurring through the entire two hour tour. Not very interesting insights either and it was so freaking hot on the boat I was just trying not to pass out from the heat and humidity. They stuff these boats to the brim and it's a total tourist trap. The water is brown and there is little to see. Much better off doing a swamp tour so you can at least see alligators and birds.  The one positive is they don't charge an arm and a leg for cold drinks which are an absolute must on this tour if you must go. So many other fun things to enjoy; I'd skip this one if I were you. [REVIEW_29] The mere existence of The Cubby Hole makes it virtually impossible for my boyfriend and I to have omelettes or French toast anywhere else. The eggs are impossibly fluffy and always perfectly prepared. The inventive menu always offers something new to try. We usually split something sweet like French toast and then we each have an omelette or something else on the menu. Lunch here is equally delicious. We have eaten here so many times and this tiny charming restaurant is always cheerful and full of locals; regulars and diners filing in off the street. The friendly service and delicious food make it worth the wait.   It is truly a happy place for us! [REVIEW_30] Hands down the best white pizza I've ever had. The Fireside salad is also one of my favorites.",20
42,"[REVIEW_1] I will literally never eat here because the owner/parking lot bouncer was very rude when we went to dinner on Saint Patrick's day ar Tir a Nog.. We tried to park in open parking that was sectioned off by SHORT HILLS RESTAURANT AND DELI OF CHERRY HILL NJ;  orange cones and signs (which by the way are completely illegal) and they were not respectful nice or friendly about us accidentally parking there.. They were simply jealous of the prosperous Irish pub... The man/parking lot bouncer (not sure of his name) was completely rude... Even though they closed at 9 he would not let us park there as of 8:15... We are new residents to this area and looking for new local places to enjoy BUT we will NOT EVER be enjoying this place (SHORT HILLS RESTAURANT AND DELI) since the owner(or parking lot bouncer was so rude) we will NEVER fraternize a business who stands for being rude to their neighbors and especially to their fellow business owners who pay for the parking spots just as much as they do.... Short Hills Restaurant and Deli  I'm extremely disappointed in you're neighborhood hospitality and how you treat you're neighbors!! [REVIEW_2] They send many jobs over seas to phillipines and india. Its hard to speak to anyone from usa.... Great service top of the line but cant see sending my hard earned American money over seas..... What a bummer.... [REVIEW_3] As a senior; I was looking for a bank for investments.  I wanted to diversify; and not have all my money with Edward Jones which is a great investment company.  When I entered the bank I was ignored.  The employees were chatting.  I had $500;000+ to invest.  I do not know why I was treated this way; but I chose to leave and go else where. [REVIEW_4] This place is a horror show.  You're on camera 100% of the time; which they remind you of constantly by putting the CCTV screens in your face just like a check-cashing place. You may be watched the entire time you're there; but not a single person in an orange apron is going to ask if you need anything. They're content to willfully ignore most customers as they chat amongst themselves at the ends of the aisles.  I tried to pay for my $200+ worth of bits and drivers; sockets and keys; which took me over an hour to get together because I was never asked if I needed help and when I finally asked; he didn't have a clue what I was talking about. I tried to use the self checkout; the attendant canceled my order twice after I'd checked about half of the little bits. Extenders. Sockets. LOTS of little items. When she told me to start again for the THIRD time; I walked out.  Never again. [REVIEW_5] Quality of this store has gone downhill over the past few years. In the past;  I was able to easily choose from a wide selection of food at reasonable prices any time of day. I have noticed recently that the produce is not as fresh; but more expensive;  and the prices of the organic foods are more expensive than Whole Foods. This morning I debated on going to Wegmans or going to this store. I only had to get a few items so I decided on this Giant since it was closer. Big mistake. I have seen on average at least 3 or 4 people shopping around 5 a.m. In the past but today just me. They had all of the store roped off where it was impossible to get to certain aisles and very difficult to get to the register. In my frustration I went under a rope to get soup.  I was then berated by a number of people who were supposed to be cleaning the floors but some were just standing around doing nothing. I couldn't even walk out of the closest door because that was blocked off. If they needed to clean the floor they should have closed the store for a few hours. It would have taken less time at Wegmans which is where I will shop for now on. [REVIEW_6] FAN.TAS.TIC! This place is the real deal; folks! A group of co-workers and I visited here for lunch this week. It came highly recommended by a few of them.  There was a decent sized group of us; but we were seated right away.  We started with the Flash Fried Brussel Sprouts. These were SO GOOD!!  Everyone at the table enjoyed them.  For my meal; I ordered the Block Burger with no bun; and was able to add a half salad instead of the fries. There's an upcharge of $3 to do this; but the salad is large! And it's only the half sized version! You chose between the Block salad or the Beet and Apple salad. I chose the Block which is almost like a Cobb salad. It was so fresh and tasty!  The burger was cooked to perfection and exactly what I wanted.  The staff were attentive; friendly; and personable.  The restaurant itself was clean and the decor was nice.  I would definitely visit again! [REVIEW_7] Fantastic! My favorite way to start a vacation in a new city. Bring cash; because you will WANT to tip the guide well by the end. [REVIEW_8] Wonderful experience both times. It can get really busy for dinner but the wait isn't that long. Our lovely waitress gave us free gumbo because we waited a few minutes for her to take our order and man was it good. My favorite has been the crawfish étouffée. But oysters looked awesome too! Can't wait to come back and eat our bread pudding. It was so good that I am reviewing before we are done. [REVIEW_9] Han dynasty is amazing as advertised. A bunch of my friends always brag about it and I had to go there. The dan dan noodles are amazing. They're so addictive that I've been craving them since I left the building. Definitely going to make it a regular place to go to on my list [REVIEW_10] outdoor pool not heated.  smelled cigarette smoke inside hotel; allows pets a negative for us; the eliptical exercise equipment was very strange; looked like it was with a bicycle.  couldn't figure it out.  will try a different hampton in Tucson next time.  been staying at this one for years; and it's gone downhill. [REVIEW_11] This place has good food. However; the customer service is terrible. I arrived at around 7:30 pm on a Thursday and I wanted to order a take out appetizer or meal. First; I asked them what was the meal of the day. A waitress told me that they don't have any left. Ok that was understandable. Then I asked the same waitress if I can order meat pies (arayes). She said that this will take 40 minutes to make it ready. She pointed to a group of people sitting of about 25 persons and implied that they were busy making food for them. Afterwards; I asked her what about just a regular appetizer like hummus and baba gannoush. She again said that they need 40 minutes to prepare it! Also she pointed at the same group of people with her finger.  At that point I just left the restaurant.  It is horrendous that they needed 40 minutes to prepare hummus!! It is very obvious that they were overwhelmed and didn't want to waste their time on a small order. Very unprofessional and very unwelcoming! Very bad service! [REVIEW_12] Called in to pick up my order but when I arrived they acted as though they never spoke to me. I was told I'd have to wait an extra 10 minutes on top of the 15 minutes of previous waiting. The food was undercooked and the service staff was incredibly rude. I'll never return to this place. [REVIEW_13] Please do not go to this place. The food is just horrible. I thought of giving this place a second chance; and I was disappointed again. Not that Sitar and New Delhi are great; but they are much much better than Tandoor. Please do not torture your taste buds by going to this place. [REVIEW_14] I have used the Monster Minders daily dog walking service for almost 6 months now and have been 100% satisfied!  Carrie and Lindsay instantly connected with my dog Brooklyn during the meet-and-greet.  They keep a detailed file w/ his information on hand & have a handy online booking/payment site.   Brooklyn LOVES Lindsay his first minder and is equally infatuated with his current minder Stephanie.  I was recently home sick when Stephanie came to take Brooklyn for his walk.  To no surprise; Brooklyn was delighted to see Stephanie come into the apartment!  His tail wagged the entire time she was suiting him up to go out.  After the walk he was relaxed; calm and ready for a nap.  There are many dogs in my building; with many walking services; but the concierges in my building constantly comment on how caring and sweet Stephanie and Lindsay have been with Brooklyn.    The Monster MInders are a dog-loving; trustworthy; professional and highly recommended group of people. [REVIEW_15] My; my; my! I am surprised by all the reviews that were under three stars; because this restaurant was a definite hit for me when I used to work at Boeing as a contractor.  I came into this restaurant at least once a week; Their gyro's are huge chocked full of the gyro meat and their fries are always hot and fresh! If you are a Christian; they always have free bibles they give away; in addition to different pro christian charities. If you are you not part of the christian persuasion; this is easy to ignore; simply because of the good food!  I am so upset that I don't live close to this establishment though. Would love to come in the future! [REVIEW_16] Fantastic gyro.   I got mine customized with baba ganoush.  Paid extra but worth every penny.   Nice big chunks of meat.   A welcome change from traditional thinly sliced.   This is the place to be at 2am for sure [REVIEW_17] STAY AWAY from this place unless you want to possibly be hit by a ""drunk gambler ""coming from there.  It's no wander this Joe Bob's is never busy.  The only thing that the owners and bartenders care about are the gamblers that get over-served and gamble there daily.   I'm definitely gonna stay away from that part of town after 4ish as that's when the ""heavy hitters"" come in to support the greasy; dirty; place that really only cares about their gamblers.  The kitchen has some kinda mold issues that literally smells like a sewer plant.  The 2 gals that have made a career outta this dump rely on the drunkards to tip them ""big"" if they win on the slots.  This is a very sad version of any kinda chicken joint or sports bar.  The greed that the owners share is obvious as flat screens are cheap these days and these guys can't even loosen their hands on the ""gambling profit"" to invest in to this dump.   Is sad as the original owners did a great job and these new guys don't care about anything except the profit from the slot machines; including the nasty food they serve.  The bartenders are high-strung and anything but friendly; unless of course; you are gambling big and they have a chance at a big tip.   Your better off going to the fast food chicken joint across the stree t""El Pollo Loco"" and guessing the kitchen is cleaner and the staff is friendlier and you won't be subjected to the daily drunks that drive to and from this place daily.  VERY SCARY!!! [REVIEW_18] I made reservations and they had trouble seating us when we arrived. With a hungry 1 year old toddler this did not go over well. The staff did try to accommodate us while we waited. They offered a cup of ice...which was weird or crayons for our little one. Finally; we were seated and the waitress was great. She took our drink and dinner order immediately. Then it went down hill from there. My husbands steak was awful. We found a long hair (not mine) in our daughters food. Over priced and Wendy's food would have tasted better. Save your time and money. [REVIEW_19] I always admired the cakes in the window of this store and wanted to order my daughters birthday cake here the last few years. I was very excited when my husband agreed on the Cake Boutique to make our cake for her 5th this year. I wanted a nice five layer cake and no expense was to be spared! I cannot even begin to tell you how shocked I was at their terrible customer service. The lady showed me the different cakes and informed me on how much each one was. I told her I liked the three tier cake but might need something bigger since I specifically wanted five layers. She told me the basic starting price and let me know decorations would cost more. I was fine with that and told her I would like to get the order started. When I asked her if I could taste a few flavors she said they don't let people taste for free but I could buy some cupcakes if I wanted to. When I asked if the cupcakes in the case were all the flavors they made; she just shrugged her shoulders and said ""I think so."" So I bought a chocolate; yellow and raspberry filled cupcake. I sat at the table to taste them ( I noticed after I sat down there was a sign on the table that said ""reserved for cake tasting"" ) I then asked her if there was delivery available; since I did not want to risk driving with the cake myself and possibly ruining it. She said for an additional $50 I could get it delivered. I told her my major cross streets and she said she was going to check on something and would be right back. While she was gone I tasted the cupcakes and I could not believe how dry and bland they were. I was really shocked; the raspberry filled one was a little better tasting but not by much. I really cannot tell you what specific flavor they were because she didn't tell me. So as I waited for her I decided not to use them. I can put up with bad customer service if the product is at least amazing but after I sampled it there was no way I was going to pay $600 for a cake and get treated the way I did and have it taste horrible on top of all that. So just because they have a fancy store and nice displays- don't just assume that the service is great and the product is good. I will stick with Nadine's- they have outstanding customer service and the cakes never let me down. [REVIEW_20] After trying to talk Thai with Chef & waitress so I tried it here but come out super...disappointed :( Okay their menu has variety noodle styles to choose but not even one item that we love.  ie. we ordered (SUPER spicy) somtom came out just a plain salad on top with dipping sauce from the bottle; curry tasted suck even my white folks said so :(  Don't get me wrong; this restaurant may great for some local clients but I won't recommend you trying if you seeking for authentic Thai taste. [REVIEW_21] Terrible experience! My wife ordered a mild sausage sandwich because she needs to stay away from spicy food.  They substituted with jalapeño flavored anyway with out even asking; after she stated she did not want anything spicy. How irresponsible. Will never visit again. Visit at your own risk!!!!!' [REVIEW_22] I've been here a handful of times; and bagels have always been delicious. I visited the shop on 5/19/18; and this will be my last visit. I went there because I was hungry and in need of food; but it seemed like I walked into the middle of classic P.T. Barnum show: clowns juggling while riding unicycles and elephants parading around on their hind legs. The first employee I interacted with; at the ""bulk"" bagel counter; didn't hesitate to let me know that I was attempting to order from the wrong location. Fair enough. They did have a sign on the counter; but it wasn't as conspicuous as an ""order here"" sign that dangles from the ceiling. Her tone made it clear to me that I had already committed one transgression. I then order from the attendant at the POS. I clarified my complicated order of a breakfast sandwich and two toasted everything bagels with a tomato and garlic cream cheese; three times. The first clarification was that I wanted everything bagels; not plain. The second  clarification was directed toward me because they actually have garlic and herb cream cheese; not garlic cream cheese. The third was my reiteration of the tomato and the quantity of the said bagels. At this point I had more confidence in a drunk ESL Uber driver getting me home safely than my order being prepared as per my request. After waiting for my extravagant order to be prepared to imperfection and gazing at the yellow ceiling grid with stalactites of black dust; my name was called and the first employee I interacted with hastily handed me my bagel bag. On the ride home I asked my partner in crime to ensure that there were 3 bagels in the bag because they probably ""F-ed"" the order up. He assured me that the quantity was correct. When I got home; I feverishly ripped open the wrapping on the two everything bagels; like a joyous child on Christmas Day; only to find     that the bagels had the tomatoes omitted and the cream cheese barely exceeded a skim coat. The breakfast sandwich was anemic at best with barely any protein on it. I am so glad that I expected disappointment. Honestly I'm not too upset because closer to my house there is a new bagel shop: Red House bagels; where the staff is courteous; the shop is cleaner; and the bagels a bit larger. Red House is my new bagel stop.  Sorry Newtown Bagel Co; you've been replaced. Although your actual bagels are slightly better tasting; it is not enough to reconcile the pain points associated with your operations. My words of advice; replace (don't clean) your ceiling tiles and clean the filth from the grid. Having almost 10 years of food and beverage experience; I would hate to see what your walk-in and floors behind the counter look like. Coach your employees on courteous service; or maybe treat them better and they might pass that on to your patrons. Oh and maybe write the orders down before entering them into the POS; because sometimes those machines aren't as navigable for some operators. I'd like to keep going on about this; but I am probably beating an already abused P.T. Barnum animal. [REVIEW_23] Went here on a date Friday 10/20/2017 @ 5:30 before a movie and all I can say is superb!. Great food and service and a fork for me. We split a tempura roll and 2 entrees; sashimi and sushi I think. Lovely presentation and taste. Can't wait to go again. I will definitely make reservations 1st this time as they were filling up even this early. State store is almost next door as this is BYOB. [REVIEW_24] The bouncers are awful; but I would be too if I were 4-feet tall and had an infinite amount of pent-up aggression and shielded childhood memories.   This place stands for everything Reno shouldn't be. Choose LEX only if the sole alternative is being waterboarded during thanksgiving dinner. [REVIEW_25] Well; honestly if I could give zero star than I would; because it is extremely Americanized not close to being Indian. The items on the menu are a complete creation of the owner.  For example; There is nothing like salad chat or a tandoori tikka chat in india. So if you are looking to eat real Indian chat; than I would not go there. I don't know how the place got all the positive reviews; maybe some free food for reviews; who knows. But this review is coming from an Indian who loves Indian food and has explored many Indian restaurant serving Chat across the country. I know it's a bit harsh; but the goal is to give  honest review of the food; without being rude. I hope it helps!! [REVIEW_26] Bus over an hour late before I gave up. Call centers not open to get information until after 6 am even though they have busses running at 4:35 am. Would not give refund and use terms and conditions item 14 as a blanket clause to not give refund [REVIEW_27] We have rented from Milpas Rental for over 12 years to include major rentals for our vacation home remodel. I rented a carpet cleaner from them today as I could not get a carpeting cleaning company to come out on short notice. Upon using the carpet cleaner I run into a glitch. When returning the item I explained the situation and they were most accommodating. Thanks again! [REVIEW_28] Such a disappointment. I was expecting this to be one of the best burgers I've ever had (as I've heard) and some of the best fries; and I was completely underwhelmed. I ordered a burger with truffle mushrooms and a fried egg- cooked medium. The burger was completely over-cooked; way too salty; crumbling on my plate; and I couldn't drown it in enough ketchup to make it taste good. The fries were soggy and cold. My stepmother ordered the chicken sandwich and the chicken was so dry! Shake shack is WAY better. Sad. A for presentation; F for execution. Sorry but; if you're known for burgers and fries you should have a chef who knows how to execute. [REVIEW_29] Can't really recommend Jack Flash Electric. I called them a month ago to make an appointment to get a live wire terminated in my house. It took them almost a week to return my call. The receptionist said she'd need to call me back to make an appointment and they just never contacted me again. I can't do weekend appointments; so I understand that there needed to be some wiggle room with their schedule. But they should have at least contacted me to tell me they couldn't do the work. [REVIEW_30] Very disappointed. Store hours online need to be updated; showed up at 8pm thinking they were open until 9pm and the doors were locked. There is a sign on the door that says ""Fall hours"" are only until 8pm...",9
43,"[REVIEW_1] Worst customer service ever; food is par by far; dirty tables; nothing like a real New York slice; I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is away from home in need of a slice of pie. I taste the time frame of some of the ingredients; Like they sat to long before being used. How could the great state of NY ever allow people who serve crappy food to use their name. [REVIEW_2] The nachos were seriously disgusting... Probably the grossest food I've had in a long time. The waitress was rude; unresponsive; and had a bad attitude. I will not return. [REVIEW_3] Horrible service! They asked us to put the baby carrier on the floor instead of giving us a bigger table. Are you kidding? I felt completely guilty to have suggested the place. Unbelievably lousy service. Never again! [REVIEW_4] I constantly go to coffee shops to study and I am obsessed with teas and latte art. I'm a huge fan of savory cafe and I just tried coffee cat for the first time today. I've been to French press countless times with friends and today completely changed my opinion. I've been sitting here for twenty minutes lost in homework planning on being here for way too long to write several essays and order numerous drinks. However I didn't feel like getting one the second I sat down. One of the baristas just came up to me and basically accused me of not getting a drink. Our conversion; ""did we get you a drink"" ""no I haven't ordered one yet"" ""are you going to"" ""yes; in do time"" ""thanks"" Do I have to order one the second I get here?!?! It's not like I look fucking homeless here with my Mac and nice clothes. Actually baffled hahaha I wish I wasn't so pleasant when she spoke with me. What's up with the fact that they don't have green tea matcha powder? Their coffee is good I'll give them that; but maybe they need to weave out some of the rude people who work here. Pitty. I'm a loyal customer. [REVIEW_5] This place is over priced; it was totally empty on a Friday night at 9:30.... Disappointed that I didn't look at the menu before coming here and just looked at the rating. The quality of the food is completely off. They didn't give us utensils to begin with. I am disappointed. [REVIEW_6] Stay away. My husband and I stopped here this afternoon to use a gift card given to us a long time ago. We do not normally buy cold stone ice cream; and we're pretty easy to please. All we were looking for was a nice cold treat on a hot day- what we got was a small ice cream that was way too sweet (yes; even for ice cream!); and a chocolate shake that was not good; for about $11. My husband took one sip of his shake and pushed it away. I took a taste and agreed that something was not right. It had a distinctly sour; bitter aftertaste. While I finished my ice cream; he debated about whether he wanted something else instead. Since the ingredients seemed to be the problem; he decided did not want something else; even though my ice cream seemed fine. When I took the shake back to the register and explained the problem; we were told we could not receive a refund; only a replacement. Both of us had an upset stomach for about two hours afterwards; and neither of us had more than a sip or two. Poor customer service; bad ingredients. Food poisoning is not worth $11; so we simply left.  Poor customer service is my biggest pet peeve- as someone who has worked in customer service and international sales for four years; I promise you- it's really not THAT difficult of a task to make sure your customer is happy; even if there is a language/geographical barrier (today; there was neither). While I realize that the employee I spoke to is probably a minimum wage high school student; store policies that young woman has to follow are set by real adults. Whoever set the policies for this store clearly is not doing their job!  Shame on you; coldstone; for trying to give my (active-duty & a veteran) husband food poisoning on Memorial Day; and refusing to make any real attempt to make amends. Don't worry; you sure as hell won't see us again; ever. Fool me once.... [REVIEW_7] I haven't been here for at least three years and it's due to the service. Everytime I went to this store; just to look mostly; the staff were stuck up and one girl was even telling me how to hold a book so I don't break the binding. She even told me I have to pay for it if I hold it wrong. It was so odd that I just left and never went back. When I was in highschool; in the late 90's; this store was great but being grown up now I expect better service. Maybe they've changed but after over 10 visits of the same crummy service I'm not sure I want to find out. [REVIEW_8] After a long trip where we stayed at many hotels this is by far the worst and more expensive then two we stayed at.   This hotel fails to get the simple things right and when you fail at that everything else is secondary.   Customer experience: Phase two of the customer experience was the beginning of the issues. There was no clear signage to direct you to the valet when we arrived at 10:30 pm which caused me to circle the block to make another pass and find it.   Phase three the AC system is not adequate at all to cool the room; I set the thermostat to 65 degrees in the living room and the bedroom was still hot and not just for me but my girlfriend as well. The curtains do not block out the sun as they don't close all the way. So instead of a nice long sleep I can't sleep with the heat then the sun bright in early through the window wakes us up.   At this point I got up to take a shower which is one with the horrible cheap shower curtains that divide halfway up. I got the shower curtain with the one half inside the shower and the other half outside. When I finished the shower the floor was soaked. It's annoying because I specifically took the time to get that stupid cheap shower curtain setup right and it still leaked everywhere.   Hopefully they will buy real shower curtains; upgrade the AC; and fix the blinds so people can get a good rest but after this night I'm done with Embassy Suites Tampa.  The wifi does not work so don't stay here if you need to get work done unless you use cellular data like I did.  As we were leaving I noticed all the black hold on the wall in the living room area. Pictures attached. [REVIEW_9] The best brunch we have had since moving back to indy. It is a small place and very popular so be ready to wait. The wait was worth it. Unique combinations meets worldly rustic style. I had a brunch style burger and was so satisfied it shocked me. My wife had a sweet and savory brunch grilled cheese. We will be going back for date lunch on a regular....I almost forgot the drinks. I had a Stumbling Sailor and it was something I craved when I was on liberty in an over seas port and just woke up from a hard night out. Spicy; full of flavor and strong! [REVIEW_10] We got there 30 plus minutes before the show expecting to enjoy a drink or two and some food before the show...were told a server would be right over to help us...no one ever came...so no drinks or food...seats were comfortable but no service took a lot out of the experience. [REVIEW_11] this place was awful. the first time my mother and I went we were very excited because everyone had been talking about it and we want to support local business. The day we went it happened to be pouring raining. So we are standing there at the hostess stand cold and wet waiting to be seated. Not only was the hostess not there; no one even acknowledged that we were there. The bartender who was right next to he stand was on his blue tooth and only looked our way to flirt with me. My mom was so annoyed we just left.   The second time we went was because we were going to be in the area and we decided to give it a second try. We were seated right away and the music was really good. The waiter could have cared less about our table. he acted like we were doing him a favor by even coming to the table. The menu was thin and nothing to really choose from. when he eventually brought the food it was decent. My mom hated her salmon cakes because they were overly breaded and poorly season. it honestly looked like two pieces of bread.   It was overpriced for what we had. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. The take out makes great dog food though. [REVIEW_12] Really poor seating management. 6:00 on a Sunday and the hostess has seated several parties of 2 at 4 tops leaving all the small tables open and no tables for larger parties. Then suggests I go eat at the bar with my minor children. [REVIEW_13] Don't do it.   I brought my VW in for service 3 weeks ago-turns out I needed a new accelerator.  My car sat at Walker for 3.5 weeks before my ""service director"" called to let me know I can pick the car up at my convenience.  Okay; so I pick my car up.  Drive it home.  Go inside to prepare for work.  About an hour later; I go to start my car to begin the drive to work... Car wont start.  I immediately called VW.  They played dumb; but told me to send it back to them.  That was a week ago and am still waiting on a return call regarding the status of my vehicle.  Overall; the customer service sucks; the actual service sucks (and VERY expensive)  What more can I say?  Walker VW can be the kiss of death for your car. [REVIEW_14] Unprofessional manager; that manager I spoke to was not listening to me at all.  He would talk as fast as he could and would not let me say what I call for; every time I say something he would start talking and keep talking just running all over my words; neither of us listening to each other; only escalated voice tones. It was not worth the 10% which was about $20.00; I would save by using my government issued veterans id card but because of some verbiage that was not on the ID; Home Depot decline the discount.  The cashier interrogated me took my ID looked at it then at me and said I could not use the Id; I never had a problem before.  She stop talking and stood there waiting for my money.  The manager did not want to hear me out and the check out person were  both very disrespectful and rude. [REVIEW_15] I wish I could give zero stars to this poor excuse for a restaurant... On the way back from Philly to our beach house recently; my wife and I stopped in for a sandwich.  We were led to a nice booth and greeted by a young girl waitress.  My wife ordered a grilled cheese and asked for some DICED tomatoes in it.  The young waitress repeated the order back and said of course- no problem.  I ordered the veggie bean burger and she asked how would I like it cooked- which was odd; but I added ""medium please"".  I ordered iced tea for my wife and me and added onion rings to my order.  A full 28 minutes later our sandwiches appeared.  My wife's order came with SLICED tomatoes- no biggie- and she just ate it anyway;  I attempted to bite my burger and  roll and nearly broke a tooth on the over-microwaved wheat roll. My wife laughed as the entire burger fell out onto the plate splattering ketchup and mustard on my polo shirt. 5 minutes later the waitress reappeared and I explained that perhaps something had gone awry in the kitchen and she quickly brought me a new roll.  This one was mostly frozen... so I told her never mind- I'll just eat the patty and tomato/lettuce.  The patty was cardboard but I ate it anyway... my wife was busy dabbing my shirt to remove the mustard/ketchup stains when the waitress came back to apologize that the cook was overwhelmed by a party in the next room. (Odd; since there were only 8 or 9 cars in the lot outside.)  She was very timid about offering the explanation and I just accepted it as not totally her fault but rather (I assumed) an intimidating short order cook in the back somewhere.  Upon leaving; I advised the floor manager at the register very quietly about the roll and she made a face and took off three dollars from the bill since ""you ate the burger part""... with no apology or attempt at customer service. The waitress got her full tip.   I was so angry that I vowed to open a yelp account and DID!  Avoid this place at all costs. [REVIEW_16] Came for all-you-can-eat; and ended up waiting for over half an hour to get our order in. The servers completely ignored us; while taking orders from the tables around us. And on top of that; all of the rolls contain ""extras"" not listed on the menu. One roll surprised us by having sweet mustard sauce on it; which did NOT taste very good.... On the bright side; once we actually got our orders in they didn't take all that long to make them. [REVIEW_17] I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND !!Late lunch (1:30pm) on Monday 7/16. No more than 4 tables. Seated at a dirty table. Waiter came after about 5 minutes asking if I wanted water (it's Reno!!). Came back minutes later with water and said my glass of wine was ""being poured.""  He wanted to take my order. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich (no onion ). Wine (finally) came right before the food. Fries were stale and cold. Chicken inside of sandwich was so chard it was hard to eat. Waiter NEVER returned until he brought the check. I complained about the quality. Was ""comped"" the sandwich. Never apologized to; nor given any sense of caring. Food was awful; service was inattentive and it was over priced. [REVIEW_18] The order process for the drive through is a complete failure and waste of time. Currently 4 out of four for not getting the order correct. Missing items every time. Too much playtime in there with the kids. This restaurant performs horrible compared to others. After my complaint; they even admitted it. Visit during the week around 3pm. Continuous failure!!! [REVIEW_19] The food was tasty service not so good two of us got our plates then the third person then finally the fourth person and then after we asked we got our appetizers felt kind of rushed out of there a lot of money not a nice atmosphere [REVIEW_20] Expected better with all the hype. Tastes like bland day old pizza with a rubber crust. And I watched them make it. Perhaps this ""under new management"" thing has something to do with it? [REVIEW_21] The first beer was warm  Didn't stay for the second die to the fact and didn't eat the food because if they can not serve cold beer WTF would you expect good food ? [REVIEW_22] I received a vase of flowers for Mother's Day and they are terrible. I'm sure my son paid top dollar; because he always does. But this very small bouquet had only three roses that never opened and wilted within two days. The rest of the arrangement was cheap filler flowers. It came in a plain glass vase with dirty water and no bow or ribbon. They forgot the candy that came with it and had to deliver it later in the day. Look elsewhere if you are looking to send an impressive gift; because this one was not. [REVIEW_23] Has anyone made the joke about panning Pan D'Olive yet? Because; wow; this place is super terrible. Our server was mostly absent and left us waiting for our check for over ten minutes after we'd given up on trying to eat the food. My partner's Pepsi glass came with bright pink lipstick on it; and when we pointed it out to a server the guy laughed and asked if he had tasted it; LITERALLY IF MY PARTNER HAD FELT THE LIPSTICK ON HIS MOUTH. He also apologized; but we were still charged for the Pepsi my partner didn't drink. But not for the bonus lipstick; so; yay? I ordered a vegetarian pasta dish that left a gross greasy film in my mouth but was otherwise tasteless. My partner got the pork chop and garlic mashed potatoes; both of which tasted more like burnt and neither of which tasted like garlic. The mashed potatoes were watery and the meat was a poor quality chop with a weird texture.   We did love the salads and the olive bread. [REVIEW_24] We expected so much more from an SPG Hotel. We stayed at the Aloft because we were in town for a funeral and we are SPG preferred members. However.....this hotel left a lot to be desired.   We paid in advance online and arrived late in the evening to check-in; the parking lot was packed; we drove around for quite some time to find a space and then walked a short distance to the front doors of the hotel and the lobby was packed! Music playing; people seated at the bar; playing pool and just sort-of hanging out. We were extremely exhausted after driving in from New Jersey. After attending a funeral; repass at the church and then again at the home of the family; it was quite a long day and we were a bit hungry and tired.     We checked in; paid $10.00 for parking (which I'll talk more about shortly) and asked if they had room service; which they do not and we were given a menu of a place that delivered. We took the elevator to our floor and as soon as we stepped off the elevator we were greeted with dog poop on the floor. As we walked down the hall to our room; we were greeted with the smell of weed; pot; Mary Jane; marijuana or whatever you want to call it. We got into our room and called the front desk and advised them of the dog poop and then placed an order with Femi's pizza for delivery.   My boyfriend then went down to the hotel bar to grab a drink; as he sat down at the bar there was a woman and man seated beside him and he could hear their entire conversation; the young woman was telling the gentleman her cost for SERVICES; yes; those services! My boyfriend took a few sips of his drink and got up to come back to our room; he was then approached by THREE women who asked him if they could go back to his room with him; he said no thank you; and that he had a girlfriend upstairs that he was going back to; and they said; ""too bad; you could have had some fun tonight""   Once back safely our room the food delivery called to say that the hotel would not let me up and that we needed to come down to pick up our food. We ate and went right to sleep. The next morning we woke to the sounds of planes departing and arriving; we showered; dressed and checked out of the hotel.   As I mentioned earlier; I would tell you about parking. We paid the additional $10.00 for parking as parking was not included. We got to the gate to slide in our paid parking pass and the gate was GONE; their was nothing there and we just drove away and headed back to New Jersey.   The hotel and rooms are quite trendy; the shower was nice and the complimentary body wash and 2 in1 shampoo and conditioner were nice. However; there was a bit of a sour smell coming from the drain; the bed was pretty basic; I would not want to sleep on it more that one night. The wall unit a/c turned on and off all night; I tried to adjust the temp on the unit itself and it would not adjust. I noticed the thermostat on the wall and tried adjusting it and it did not work either; so I just unplugged the unit.    Whenever we go back to Philadelphia; we will not stay at the Aloft and I do not recommend it. [REVIEW_25] As a senior; I was looking for a bank for investments.  I wanted to diversify; and not have all my money with Edward Jones which is a great investment company.  When I entered the bank I was ignored.  The employees were chatting.  I had $500;000+ to invest.  I do not know why I was treated this way; but I chose to leave and go else where. [REVIEW_26] i cannot recall any major problems with projection or sound; so i'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say there were none.  but that's the only positive thing i have to say about this place.  not enough parking; lazy and incompetent staff; and screen-talking so loud and unchecked that it MUST be the norm here.   i seriously doubt that screen-talkers read reviews of theaters but in case you are one and you do: i didn't pay to hear your opinion; reaction; or synopsis of events for the person you came with that missed it because he went to the bathroom/was busy talking on his cell in the theater.    if the fact that you had to drive to it and are surrounded by strangers didn't clue you in; i'd think that for the prices they charge to see a movie you'd realize this isn't your living room.  i hate you.    end rant. [REVIEW_27] This Mcdonalds has poor management. Went there once and they informed us they were out of straws. Another time The shake machine for st pattys shakes was down and they didn't know when it would be up. Went there 2 weeks later and it was still down. Went there once for take home and when we got home there was no hamburger in the buns. Just a bun with pickles; tomatoes; and lettuce. Finally I got the message that these people did not care about their customers and stop going there. [REVIEW_28] The worst wawa I've ever been to. Don't recommend ordering food inside: their employees are just standing and talking until you actually get something else; pay; walk around for a little; check if it's done yet and finally give them a look. That's when they go ""oh! There's food to make!"" Making latte in the morning takes them over 5 minutes; they're watching videos on their phones; chatting and slowly walking towards their stations. I hate the fact that it's the only place where I can get coffee on my way to work. I am the manager at the local pizza chain and my employees would never disrespect customers like that: if food has to be made they make it instead of talking! If the manager is reading this right now please take care of the situation; look at the cameras and you will see. The whole point of getting food and coffee at wawa in the morning it's because it's FASTER. But that's not what your employees think. [REVIEW_29] I had not visited Perlis in over thirty years and I now remember why.   My mother used to bring me there when I was growing up. My relatives shopped there too ; it was THE place that all of the old well to do familys of New Orleans went.       As a child ; I never noticed the rudeness ; I guess because it was my mom who had to work with the attendants while I sat board.   At twenty three ; I had not yet purchased my own suits ; and was still wearing the ones my mother had bought for me in my early years.    As a Twenty two year old I was a little intimidated as I walked in and saw the well dressed ; sofisticated attendants . I remember receiving glares and a very rude ; sarcastic  "" may I help you  "" from what appeared to be the man in charge at the time.   The rest of the visit didn't get any better. The attendant had a rude arrogance about him ; as though he was doing me a favor even speaking to me .  He obviously did not remember me from the last ten years of business that my mother had given them ; or maybe he did and just didn't care .  I suppose that having established themselves as THE place to buy clothing ; they had developed an attitude of superiority ; but to what ; or who ? These guys sell clothes for gods sake ; who are they superior to ?      This attitude has NOT changed.     A month ago ; I decided to see if a quarter century had brought about anything positive in the way of attitude.  My treatment was no different from that of my visit in 1982.  One of my attendants ( the head guy that day)  ; had the same arrogance as I remembered from years past.  His desire was to put me in what HE thought was best and displayed a sneer at my taste ; ( wich is quite conservative in nature and right up their alley ).     I ended up getting three pairs of pants ; one of which needed to be left for tailoring. I was told that I would be called when they were ready.     Four weeks had gone by with no call ; so I called them.  The mans tone on the end of the line was one of a person insulted . It seems that I was the one in error for having waited that long before calling ; and my tardiness was the insult.  How dare I suggest that Perlis would not have the work done in a week!!!    "" We always do "" ; he said.  "" May I ask who your attendant was  "" ?   ""  I don't remember "" I replied .            Then  ; with a VERY sarcastic  "" we'll do you remember the color  ; sir "" ?  ; with the sarcastic emphasis on sir.    "" I really don't ; it was a moth ago  ; and I bought them purely on a whim "" ; I replied .     "" Well wait just a minute SIR and I'll go look"" .      It was then that ; wether by mistake or on purpose ;  I heard him say as the phone left his ear for the counter  ; "" STUPID IDIOT "" !!                It was 30 minutes later that went through the door of Perlis for the last time.   There to greet me with same snied. ; "" may I help you sir "" ;  was the man I had spoken with on the phone. In my minds eye ;  I was expecting to see someone like those who I had seen the month before ; someone about 45 ; dressed to the old New Orleans nines ; but to my surprise it was a much older fellow ; short in stature ; and wearing a suit that I can only describe as strangely old fashioned ; like something the duke of Windsor might have worn in 1968.  It's funny ; I remember a picture from my childhood of a chimpanzee in a plaid suit very similar to the one he was wearing.  The picture was a spoof of a used car salesman if I recall.      While handing me the trousers he said ; in his now standard ; and rather lyrical sarcastic tone ; "" come again SIR ""  .   Not wanting confrontation ; I muttered ; "" not likely "" as I left their store for good.       I really don't know where these guys get off acting this way!?  Is business so good that they can treat customers with such disrespect and still gain new customers over the years?  That just doesn't add up.  I am sure I can't be alone in my experience. I wonder how many hundreds of thousands of dollars thes strangely arrogant people have lost over the decades by insulting customers this way?      Old man Perlis had better take heed of the fact that anyone can get anything in his store over the internet ; and for less. [REVIEW_30] By far the worst hotel experience of my life.  The reservations staff makes promises that the front desk are not able/willing to keep; and you are left without the room you expected.  This morning the fire alarm went off in the hallway - the cleaning staff out in the hall had no idea what was going on; but said that if it was a drill; an announcement would have come over the loudspeaker.  I'm on the 15th floor; elevators disabled.  Called down to the front desk; only to be put on hold.  Several other hotel guests were in the hall trying to figure out what to do.  Once the alarm was off and the elevator was working I went down to the front desk and was told that ""they"" were checking and working on the elevators and alarms; and that this would be happening all day.  There WAS a sign on the 1st floor about this; but absolutely NO NOTIFICATION to any of the guests on the upper floors.  At least not to the half dozen or so people I spoke to.  I told the manager that she had many terrified people up there; and that the hotel should have made an effort to notify their guests - push a note under the room door; leave a phone message; or at least inform the cleaning staff so they could pass the word along.  I told her that I would leave the hotel if I could; but that I had one more day there.  She offered to cancel my stay so I could leave early.  WOW....what a way to handle a disgruntled guest who has a bill of over $2000 at your hotel.  To not keep reservation promises and not care about how it inconveniences your guests is one thing; but to not care about their safety; and leave them terrified...that's a totally different thing.  I will never stay at this hotel or any of the other hotels/resorts run by the Summit Group.",1
44,"[REVIEW_1] update on this review. i went here last night and it was gross. i had a few pieces of nigiri (salmon) and it was warm and soggy. ahh gross. they were not that busy and I could not get my plastic cup of water filled.  The sushi was filled with packed; tight rice and cut in large; gigantic portions. i hate that.  It has always been inconsistent for me which sucks. they have def. gone downhill. will not be back there again. There are many other great places to eat. (hiroba; sushi pier never disappoints.) [REVIEW_2] Staffed exclusively by apathetic; dull-witted employees committed to helping you as little as is humanly possible. First one I asked for help wasn't even aware the business had closed 15 minutes before; which would have saved me some time; the second replied to a question about whether there were any other open car washes close by with ""Do you know how to work GPS on your phone?"" Absolute waste of time. [REVIEW_3] Conveniently located but they jack the price up unfairly when they feel like it. Watch them when they ring you up when you buy alcohol. [REVIEW_4] My first time coming here was super awesome. So I decide to bring my Mom for my second visit. Unfortunately I was so disappointed and mad that I took my mom here for lunch. We waited for about an hour for our food and they even manage to messed it up.  Might come back for the drinks but not for the food. [REVIEW_5] If i could give it no stars i would.Worst television  service ever!!! I warn you not to go though with direct t.v! I have had problems with them over charging me since the moment I signed up with them. They even sent me to collections for att Wifi service that I didn't even have!!!!! I would stick with Charter Cable! They are wayyyyy better! [REVIEW_6] Horrible food; undercooked sushi rice; pretty much bad everything. Don't waste your time or money [REVIEW_7] I talked with the owner today and he said ""that does not sound like Marge."" Marge has been rude to a lot of people and they are afraid to tell the owner but I am not afraid to tell the owner. All the owner wants to do is talk to Marge. She will never change her attitude. All she does is pull the wool over the owners eyes. She even does friends laundry while at work and takes their money but does not log it as worked. [REVIEW_8] So I called and placed an order over the phone with pizza huts apparent call center. the little girl who sounded all of seventeen was very unprofessional no phone experience she messed up my order and put me on hold whole she had a side bar conversation about her friend finally showing up for work.  I say this because when I got there it was a all male crew! My order was wrong the lady had relayed a totally different order. The poor guy at pizza hut making pizza was so frustrated no his fault I totally understood at this point. He apologized and told me he would re make it right now correctly such a respectable man. Something between who takes the call somewhere else and who relays to the establishment has a disconnect. Annoying to have to drive all the way back! [REVIEW_9] I've NEVER been to a Starbucks & have had to go inside & wait at least 4 minutes for a knife because they forgot to put one in my bagel bag; I've also never been to a Starbucks where they don't hand a single napkin. [REVIEW_10] the foods great; but no buflight on tap.i love the servers there ; especially Jamie White; whose the best server. But again. Lack of Bud light is a big negative [REVIEW_11] I have been to a couple of Keke's in other cities; however; was exceedingly disappointed with my experience today. After an hour of waiting we were told our order was misplaced and it would be out shortly. I understand these things happen; yet the employees and manager made no attempts to make our experience better. The manager acknowledged once the food was delivered that the portions were small and inaccurate. However; icing on the cake was the waitress dropping off the check as we finally got our first bite. Not to check on us even during the rest our meal. If someone had made a single attempt to make our experience better I would not be writing this review; but today I paid for extremely poor service and I do not plan to return. [REVIEW_12] Don't go here during late night. Fast food resteraunts in the city love to not give a shit at 2:00am and not take your order even though their open 24/hrs. Terrible. [REVIEW_13] Overpriced and pretentious...this outfit charges 2x the normal price for everything.  Didn't try all of the 17 restaurants; but what I did have was just average.   Rooms weren't even as nice as the much lower priced Hampton Inn.    Cannot express how disappointed I was.  Seemed like if you just looked at something they charged you for it.    The interior gardens were nice but really not worth it. This is Disney World for adults [REVIEW_14] Inedible & FDA Beware!   Le Saigon wins the #1 prize of being the most inconsiderate; rude; and unsafe restaurant on the main line.  The produce; meats; and other ingredients used by the owner of Le Saigon is cheap; expired; and extremely unsafe.  The food is horribly prepared and lacks any flavor.    The service is rude.  I bet you Le Saigon will have the same fate at Yangming; that is; it will be shut down by the FDA.    An embarrassment to the Main Line restaurants. [REVIEW_15] My first time to La Fusion; on my way to the mall; decided to grab a bite first. Great food; great service; very beautiful restaurant setup; very clean. This restaurant has the atmosphere that is a relaxing place to catch up with friends and enjoy a great meal.    I'm very picky about where I go; I love good food; good service; and cleanliness... I gave La Fusion a five star rating because I feel that this restaurant deserves it. I would definitely return with friends. [REVIEW_16] The food and service were sooo disappointing I felt compelled to join Yelp and write this review.  The food was exceedingly bland and flavorless.   I had the beef sate with chinese broccholi  which was advertised as spicy.  Not only wasn't it spicy but the sauce had no flavor at all let alone spice or sate.  The spring roll was doughy with limp(not crisp) veggies and bland.  The duck abalone soup was the only part of the meal that had some slight flavor. My companions had the duck with vegetables over rice which looked very dry; and the vegetables had a burned oily flavor.  Another had the pork over  rice which was salty but otherwise underseasoned as well.   We waited about 15-20 minutes before our order was taken;  and the wait for the check was long as well.  The appetizers and entrees all arrived at the same time.  I've had better Chinese food from food carts.  My least satisfying meal in Chinatown; and I eat out alot all over the country. [REVIEW_17] I have used ""vrbo"" and home away websites for a longtime. This is the worst experience I have ever had with a site. My friends and I were trying to book a place for the Essence Festival in July. We knew how the housing would be an issue so we started looking for a place to stay at the end of Feb. We saw the French Quarter Suites offered Town homes; they looked nice; so we began to inquire. The process is usually pretty easy but working with Ms. Leslie was not. When asking questions about a 5br town home she would often skirt the questions and not give direct answers. She raised the prices on our stay; without our knowledge and refused to breakdown the price of our payment.  The pay for parking was never mentioned; and the we had to inquire why the invoice stated the town home was a one room annex NOT a 5 bedroom town house. The Frech Quarter Suites Hotel website and business are misleading and dishonest. [REVIEW_18] Went here with my friends and I had a horrible experience. I asked for a hookah menu and apparently it does not exist. The owner was very rude and unwelcoming. You have to pay $25 per 2 people and they only accept cash-_- I had a horrible experience!!!! If you want to hookah with friends; do not go to cleopatra cafe. [REVIEW_19] Prices are absolutely ridiculous! They charge almost $12 per item to dry clean. I should've realized something was amiss when I didn't see any signage that talked pricing. Shame on me for not asking first but every other place I've ever been charges $4 or less. The employee couldn't articulate what; precisely; causes the increase in price over the competition. I will assume that little angels kiss the clothes clean. [REVIEW_20] Outstanding! I went to this place on the strength of just two Yelp reviews.  Weary from being a traveling soccer mom for a week; I just wanted to be pampered for one hour in peace.  When I found that I could get 90 minutes of massage therapy for $60 I thought ""how bad could this be?"" But I am telling you guys; this place is awesome.  Nothing fancy; it is a modest space; more of a clinic than a spa. It is clean; quiet and they staff is super friendly.  My therapist Marlene used body pillows and heated blankets to reposition me and to get into areas deep between my shoulder blades that most other folks have never been able to get to.  6 others from my group went throughout the week and everyone was extremely pleased. If you are serious about your massages; give this place a try. Their address on Yelp is wrong. They are in a business park at 1074 North Cole Road. [REVIEW_21] I started coming here about a year ago. Since then i try to make it every Friday or Saturday night. The music; wine and pizza is great here. [REVIEW_22] Food showed up cold; salmon was raw inside; plastic in the dessert; fatty lamb chops and some sort of stringy thing at the bottom of my wine glass!! The service was great though. [REVIEW_23] This is the WORST!  OVER PRICED!  3 Little scallops (COLD!!! and cut in half!!!---they were about 1/4 inch thick!) for $10!  The other apps I got were rediculously over priced!!!  The Bartender was Very Nice!  I got take out.  I got home and almost cried! After eating $30 worth of food; I was STILL HUNGRY!!!!  NEVER AGAIN!!!!! [REVIEW_24] Absolutely fabulous service!  As I type this; I am sipping on a complementary goblet of exquisite Chardonnay; nibbling on complementary egg rolls; and chillin' like ice tea whilst my tootsies are wrapped in hot towels awaiting the final touches of this $28 pedicure. Lovely; get that tookus in gear & head it on down to Nouvelle. Whether you're needing a rub; scrub; or grub; this gem in DTSP is where it's at; okay? Also; they're in cahoots with LaV next door so you can literally eat; drink; and be Mary here! Pinkies in; or pinkies out; I think we can all agree that you can't conquer the world with nasty feet. Check it at the door; hunty! [REVIEW_25] I had heard good things about Fresh Produce but I have to say I was not impressed. I noticed that my sunflowers and blueberries were moldy upon arriving home.  The tomatoes there were all bruised and mushy.  The only thing I think that I might be happy with are my apples.  Not to mention; the woman that rang me up threw around my produce and bruised it all up.  I won't be back. [REVIEW_26] This is one of the WORST venues I've been too and definitely won't be coming back. I came here over the weekend to see Primus and I was so disappointed in both the layout of the place and the people that worked there. First the security at the door was confused; they took our tickets and then walked back in the place; leaving us outside. When he finally decided to return he actually asked us for our tickets (even though he took them with him). After rummaging through his pockets...tada! He found them and finally let us in.  We were escorted upstairs to the bar & restaurant where we were told they were out of food menus and they would give us one when it came available...so that's when the waiting game began. We waited about 10 minutes for a menu and then it took about 15 minutes for someone to circle back around and take our order. After placing our order it took them over 30 minutes to make one chicken caesar wrap. Once we finally got our food they proceed to ""kick us out"" because they needed to get the top floor ready for the show - so frustrating! The night continued to go just as frustrating. The layout of this place is rectangular and very long so if you don't get there early and man your spot; good looking getting a glimpse at the stage. They cram over 1000 people in this small club and if it wasn't for the TV screens people would have missed the show entirely. I feel horrible for about 70% of the people that came to watch the show; there is really no good seat in the house. Also their security is absolutely horrible; they were constantly rushing through the crowds to stop people from smoking or taking pictures. When they weren't shoving you to get through they were shining a flashlight in your eyes. We also had security shove us out of the way so he could stand in front of us and take video himself of the band that was playing. They are so unprofessional and rude. If you plan on going to see a show here; I wouldn't recommend it especially if there's going to be a lot of people and a sold-out show because chances are you won't see anything. And I'm serious when I say it that only about 30% of the ticket holders could see anything; the rest of us were just standing around watching the TV screens. This place is super lame and I won't ever be back. [REVIEW_27] First time here and definitely loved the food. The atmosphere and staff are great. So much food. I had leftovers for the next day! [REVIEW_28] This is the worst Taco Bell there is; and sadly; the only one open past 10; and sometimes 9 depending on how the others feel that day. I guess it's just a Nevada thing; or a Reno thing; but the Taco Bell's here are a joke and this is the worst. Been sitting in the drive-thru for 10 minutes only to be told the item I wanted isn't offered anymore; even though commercials are still playing for it. They've forgotten our food more than once; and I personally won't eat here (wife is the hopeful for it because she loves Taco Bell) because it's given us both food poisoning.  Go to Del Taco; same food poisoning; but you'll actually get your food in a timely manner; probably. [REVIEW_29] came here for good reviews. sorry but was not happy with my cut. not faded.i always say if they don't do a good fade; haircut is a shame. 2 minute massage. didn't last long enough.  never coming back [REVIEW_30] Co-workers and I placed a big order. The meal in particular was an apple cinnamon pancake with eggs and bacon for $9.99. When made thr fool mistake of trusting that everything was going to be correct with the order and when we finally opened the bag at work in that order was the pancake.. Can you imagine spending $10 on 1 pancake?? Well I called this establishment the following morning because they close at 2:30 and was instantly bombarded with negativity and rudeness from the lady who answered who placed blame on everyone else and then said JUST COME GET THE EGGS AND BACON... The rudest I've encountered in a while.",5
45,"[REVIEW_1] Oh man! This is the best BBQ shrimp I have ever eaten! The bread pudding is creamy; crispy edged deliciousness! Our server; Ishmael; was the cream of the crop! [REVIEW_2] The best hospital around! Temple has an enormous selection of departments and their doctors are some of the very best in the world.   The medical school itself is nationally ranked and the hospital campus improved every day.  Don't park more than two blocks away or your car will be on blocks when you get back; but you can't really blame the hospital for having bad neighbors. [REVIEW_3] Absolutely terrible in every aspect.  My fiancé and I came here on a Saturday at 5:45.  All of the waitstaff were standing around the back of the restaurant looking at us awkwardly.  Eventually the bartender greeted us from behind the bar and pointed to the table where we will be seated.  I ordered ""The Cactus"" margarita; and it was salt lime juice and water.  Not a drop of tequila in it.  I'll give it to them that the salsa was good because of the added chipotle.  However; they have the audacity to charge $4 for an extra basket of stale chips.  Our food came out reasonably quick. My fiancé ordered the chicken fajitas and I ordered the 5-Alarm burrito.  Mine was dry as a bone; bland; and not spicey at all.  I'm reasonably sure that they got a frozen burrito from wava and heated it under a panini press.  My fiancée chicken was also dry and just over all bland.  Then came the waiting. We asked our waitress for the check and then she disappeared for 20 minutes.  I asked her again as she passed by our table; and still had to wait another 10 minutes.  It's a different story if they were the only show in town; but this is Main Street manayunk.  There is no reason for places like this to be taking up space if this is the quality and service they are offering. [REVIEW_4] Definitely great experience overall.  Nice clean room; comfortable bed; great view; on point service. [REVIEW_5] First experience with Josh M. and A-1 Plumbing/Perfect Air and had a great experience.  Seemed sincerely to care about the client and well being.  Was not oversold on anything but given recommendations of what he would be doing if it was his home.  Felt very comfortable with the Josh and the Company's overall professionalism.  Will use for some needed repairs in future. [REVIEW_6] These guys are GREAT.  The coffee is delicious; the vibe is relaxed yet well put together; and the staff is friendly but not overbearing.  Go by - it's a a cool spot. [REVIEW_7] The food and service is fantastic.  Everything is fresh and bursting with flavor. I will come back. [REVIEW_8] Workers are nice and it is very clean kids clothes are very cute and they are for a reasonable price [REVIEW_9] Almost went to this location; but did a pivot turn when we had to step over three different types of trash just to get to the front door. Also trash scattered around the parking lot. Can't imagine how clean the kitchen is? [REVIEW_10] I must say after 20 minutes of aimlessly driving in Delran; we finally stumbled across this hidden gem. My husband and I were greeted with such friendly faces; which set the tone for the night. We told them it was our anniversary and they were more than welcome to accommodate. They gave us a nice secluded table on the beach with lit candles; it was just what we wanted. Our server was very prompt and sweet. She was more than willing to go over the menu and explain the specials in more lament terms. My husband had the Grilled ribeye and I had the Salmon. Everything was grilled to perfection with just the right accompaniments. But the cherry on top the night; of course; was dessert. I was sold as soon as our server brought over the dessert tray. We had the carrot cake and sugar free cheesecake. THE CARROT CAKE WAS UNBELIEVABLY MOIST AND DELICIOUS! The cheesecake was so creamy; you didn't even miss the sugar. I will definitely be making Foyster's Dockside a regular spot for us. [REVIEW_11] So beautiful and great trails to hike.  Very clean even with so much foot; bike and horse traffic.  Every area is scenic and amazing. Such a Tucson gem. [REVIEW_12] I am a groupie. He is amazing. I am sad that I got to have his dish only once. Now all construction on market I can't find him!!  His chicken is the most tender and smoky I've ever had. Side dishes are creative and awesome too.  I hope he is back soon. [REVIEW_13] We came here for breakfast. Loved the menu options. Also; the atmosphere was perfect with options to sit indoors or outdoors. I got the veggie wrap and my husband got the spinach and feta wrap. They were both absolutely fabulous. The hot pecan coffee was great. We even came back later and got an iced pecan coffee; which was just as good. We will visit here again. [REVIEW_14] Had salmon burger that was delicious. Server Emily was great. Saturday morning early without much of a crowd. Truffle fries really good. [REVIEW_15] Shoutout to Alyssa for transforming my brows! Over the past 3 years; she has always listened to my concerns and delivered exceptional service. My brows are fuller and I have a nice shape that I can easily maintain.  I was hoping I could post a picture in this review but I don't see an option for that so hopefully it gets uploaded to Alston Face & Body photos. Check it out - I'm wearing my sunnies in my car and it's just after seeing Alyssa! :)   As for the rest of the team; everyone is super nice; talented and helpful! [REVIEW_16] It's 11:29pm; they close at 1am their kitchen closes  at 12am. So when we asked to be sat on the rooftop; the hostess; non most-est; said that all the tables are dirty and that she personally would have to ""set that up for us."" We told her not to worry about it and adios'd MF [REVIEW_17] This was my first time here. Drawn in by a ""free original cheesy"" sandwich. The grilled cheese was terrific. The tomato - basil soup was very good; as were the waffle fries. The menu choices are intriguing; so I'll be back!!! [REVIEW_18] Very; very happy I tried this wonderful cantina. It seems they have a new chef and my first meal here was amazing. If you are a connoisseur of Mexican cuisine please try this place. I had veggie enchiladas w green sauce and it was flavorful and complex and not watery like most other Mexican veggie  dishes around town.   Im so impressed and happy to find this gem. My partner had  chicken enchiladas with red sauce and refried beans.  The red sauce reminded me of the sauce an immigrant woman I worked with used to make for potlucks.  I know I am shamelessly gushing but if you read my other reviews then you will know that it's not typical. The bartender Iris is very helpful and was a great server. Also one more thing; I want to mention the spicy margarita. It is now my new favorite drink in town. It has cilantro jalapeño and (I believe) cucumber and it is amazing. [REVIEW_19] This place is great in theory but the execution borders on offensive. I'm admittedly fresh from an interaction with front desk manager Ali; who --when I asked why my room wasn't made up despite my  calling housekeeping; stopping by the front desk and activating the green ""make up room"" button -- behaved as though making the bed; cleaning the bathroom and replenishing the tea supply was far above and beyond the call of duty for a hotel despite a guest asking three times for them to do their job. In less time than I spent requesting the service; i could have cleaned my own room. Worse still she accused me three times during two conversations of likely not knowing the difference between the green service button and the red do not disturb button. A lovely housekeeper who was nice enough to come up at 2am to bring me tea and towels for the morning saw the green button was on.     No one knows the hotel policies or amenities and I got a different answer every time I asked a question.   The binder in the room indicates that I can either use the in-room safe or a safety deposit box located at the concierge desk. When I asked the concierge to give me use of the safety deposit box; they said they had no idea what I was talking about and said maybe the front desk has that service. The front desk said there's no such safe deposit box and explained to me very slowly as tho I was a complete moron that im obviously confusing the box in my closet with a safe deposit box. No one has read their own guest binder.   The binder and literature also says there is a pool. There is not. There is not a even single place to sit or walk outside; and not just because construction is going on for the next 3 years. They could have provided some small deck or garden  area for guests to go for a breath of fresh air; since there are no balconies or windows that open.   There was turn down service on my first night here but not the second or third. Had they been providing what they claim to; they'd have been able to alert housekeeping that my green ""make up room"" light had been on for nine hours. I don't really care if my bed gets made; but if nothing is done despite the signal outside the door; à call (and voicemail) to housekeeping and physical visit to the front desk where I was assured the room was serviced; that's just bad management.    Post script: I was trying to sleep in after a late night and between 9:30 and 10:30 am the housekeepers were chatting loudly in the hall outside my room and in the adjoining room. I did not so much mind being awakened by their work; as much as terrified when -- after id dozed back off -- they repeatedly tried to open my door despite the red light being illuminated for DO NOT DISTURB. I called the front desk who put me in touch once again with housekeeping where I left a voicemail. It's like no one is in charge of this place. Not hospitable.    The gym is decent and security; bellmen and casino personnel were all lovely. [REVIEW_20] Hmmm...neighborhood sketchiness factor on a scale of 1-10 was about a 5.    But the idea of being able to have a crunchy on the outside; fluffy on the inside ball in my mouth made the trip well worth it.  I'm talking about big fried falafel balls in my mouth!!!!!  I was surprised to see how busy the place was and the variety on their menu.  We had an order of falafels---a little on the pricey side----6 for $6.99--but I suppose they were a little bit larger than some other places that I have been to.  These were pretty good.  The brother had the gyros with the greek salad.  The salad looked amazing; big chunks of feta; and stuffed grape leaf; a scoop of potato salad (ok this part didn't really look too greek to me; but it was good!); sissy and law and I had the shish kabobs.  Large portions on the platters.  Rice; beans; and a tasty cucumber/tomato salad.  The flavors were spot on and we left with full tummies.  Will definitely return to try some of the other interesting looking things on the menu (fish and wings sound quite lovely)! [REVIEW_21] Xtreme Tacos has become one of my favorite places. Everything I have ever ordered has been DELICIOUS! We have probably gotten food between 8-10 times. I have e joyed everything! For sure; always have to get chips. Their homemade chips are to die for!! The salsa and quest are both excellent for dipping.  Besides the delicious food; the people who work there are Xtremely friendly and helpful. The guy who is usually at the counter is so warm and welcoming! [REVIEW_22] Stopped by here to get a few appetizers to go. There was seating out front; and a nice little back patio area; and the bar went all around. There was live music playing as well. I got the gator tail with inferno sauce. Let me tell you; I love love love spicy food; but if you don't; that inferno sauce is no joke. So to all my mild spice friends out there; be very careful. It even came with some breaded hot peppers; which also tasted great. The gator was cooked perfectly. Also got the coconut rum shrimp - yum! They were delicious and nice sized as well. The jelly that came with them was delicious. Def will go back here when I visit Clearwater again. [REVIEW_23] We love Cafe Ponte; the food is always unique and delicious and the service is impeccable. Our favorite server is Allie; she is first class! They also have an extensive wine list and unique cocktails. The dessert is amazing too! [REVIEW_24] Lovely little restaurant which was converted from a house...lots of history to this place.  The patio area is romantic and the bar is fun to hang out in. Very good food and surprisingly not expensive. Amazing brunch on Sundays.  You know this place is great when Pamela Anderson; Brad Pitt; Jennifer Aniston; and Bill Belamy (heh heh) have been seen dining there. [REVIEW_25] Very poor customer service. We live in neighborhood and have been numerous times. This time we were on Yelp and looking for somewhere to pick up lunch. Decided to do Tampa Pizza Company since we hadn't gotten it in a while. Unfortunately chose to use the EatStreet Yelp online ordering option.  Huge mistake. Order placed; got confirmation and credit card was charged. Went over to pick up food 20 Minutes later as requested and they said they didn't get the order. They stated they don't accept Yelp/EatStreet orders online anymore. Never bothered to call us and say they actually canceled the Yelp order on us. They told us we should just re-order and pay again in the restaurant and wait another 20 minutes for it to be prepared and get a refund from EatStreet! Won't be going back with this poor customer service. Manager was even there and not helpful at all. No wonder why it was totally dead inside the place even while the Sunday market was going on right outside. [REVIEW_26] We just left Mr T's and found them to be seriously overpriced.  For example; a white resin lounger was $40 higher than 3 other places we googled; and another lounger was $150 higher than advertised elsewhere.  For a slice that advertises as having 30% off their prices are still very high.  Seems like they just raised their prices to lower them 30%. [REVIEW_27] Went to get a smog check and register my vehicle.  Willy was working; he was so wonderful!  Very nice guy; and very professional.  The business is appropriately named ""Quick Smog"" for a reason.. .I was in and out of there; with registration and smog within 7 minutes.  Very convenient location.  I will be back and I obviously highly recommend! [REVIEW_28] The carnitas (pork) tacos were incredible. So juicy; with such excellent corn tortillas. Additionally; the tres leches cake was delightful. It also wasn't too expensive compared to some upscale restaurants.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant. [REVIEW_29] I went to the drive thru hopefully I can get served so was at the speaker for half hour and lady had a attitude cause we asked if we could get service to say they had to change till and several cars left in the process I had to go home hungry that was totally sad luckily I not a diabetic [REVIEW_30] Highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for some good Indian cuisine! Great service to top it off; will federal be back here whenever I am in the Phili area!",23
46,"[REVIEW_1] I usually call before coming in so they can have my order ready to go. Suzy is so fabulous as she jets around the store ""in the cart; you got it!"" Special orders never a problem. Everyone is very nice and professional. Highly recommend! [REVIEW_2] We attended a private party recently.  The appetizer; cheese ravioli; was good.  That is the only good thing I can say.  I had chicken parm and it was awful.....I actually got a piece of grizzle I had to remove from my mouth. And it was soggy. The red gravy was among the worst I have had EVER.  And the pasta was overcooked.  I could not eat it.  A friend who also attended had the same opinion and did not eat the entrée.  I have heard negative comments about Andreas for years now.  Unfortunately this was my first time eating there.  Needless to say; we won't go back.  They should shut the place down. [REVIEW_3] disappointed that they wouldn't fill my dogfish head growlers and the beer itself wasn't memorable. [REVIEW_4] I scheduled an appointment and was told someone would be out bw 9 and 12. No one showed up. When i called to inquire when some would arrive (2:30pm); i was told my order slip never printed and no one would come out today. Would i like to reschedule for Monday. Very disappointing when you take off from work and waste your entire day. [REVIEW_5] Went to this car wash. My car looked just as dirty coming out  as it did going in. I informed the owner and she said that the car wash will not get all the dirt off and that's why they give you a towel. I thought the purpose of a car wash was to clean my car. I could see if it was filthy dirty with caked on mud or something. There was just dust on my car. It should've been cleaned. [REVIEW_6] do not come here unless you want to get lied to and ripped off!! the guy tells me $92 for my tire installed then gives me a bill for $130. he slides me a $ 10 bill and tells me this is my rebate. this place is shady and i would not recommend it to anyone who is looking to deal with people with integrity. thanks for ripping me off keystone!! [REVIEW_7] I absolutely love Jimmy Johns. I will never come back to this one.  They screwed up my ordered and their first response was ""Sorry; we can't take the sandwich back after its served. That's a health code violation.""   Too many places that care about my business for that crap. [REVIEW_8] Went to this store to get a passport sent to England A.S.A.P (which weighs next to nothing); they told me it would be $110 for 4 day delivery with no guarantee that it would arrive by then. I went to Fed Ex who told me they could do it for $57 with a 2 day guarantee. Shop around before using UPS!!! [REVIEW_9] I took my expensive Christian Louboutins here to be dyed since I had heard that this place was one of the best in the city. Boy; what an overstatement. I wanted my studded gray CLs dyed black. I SPECIFICALLY told them to please; please; please be careful not to get any dye on the red soles because that is what makes a Louboutin a Louboutin. I also asked if they could dye it without covering the studs. They told me YES. They would tape off everything that wasn't going to be dyed and it would turn out perfect. I came back a week later; like they told me. Only 1 shoe was half done. So they told me another week.  I came in to pick them up today to find the worst dye job I have ever seen in my life. There was black dye all over the studs; all over the inside and the toe box; and (worst of all) all over the red soles. Besides the damage; all of the gray had not even been dyed. There were random un-dyed patches everywhere. I told them that this was not the kind of work I was promised. Then they changed their story and said that it would have been impossible to tape off the studs. They said I should not have even tried to get them dyed. When I questioned why there is dye on the inside and why the red soles are covered in black dye splotches; they said ""I don't know"". They told me they could TRY to remove the dye but that the red might come off; too. I told them this is completely unacceptable. And then they gave me an attitude. They said ""Look; we already told you we could remove the dye. I don't understand why you keep standing here talking.""  If the job could not be done; they should have told me ahead of time. I understand it was a tedious job; what with all the studs; but there is no excuse for getting dye all over the inside and soles. He said the dye would come off as I walked. ....YOU DON'T WALK ON THE ARCHES OF THE HEELS. I asked for my money back and they told me they dyed my shoes like I asked; so what more do I want. I just took my shoes and left. They must be crazy to think I would leave my shoes there for them to ""fix"".  I instead took them to Superior Shoe Repair near 15th and Walnut. I have taken shoes there before; so I should've went there to begin with because I know they are used to dealing with designer shoes. They said they could fix it; so I will be reviewing them when I pick them up this week. [REVIEW_10] The secret is out! By far the best nail place I've been to in STL and I've tried many. The staff is superb; friendly and the salon is very tidy. The best is...they remember you! [REVIEW_11] Had booked rooms a month in advance for a bachelor party. Waited for 2 hours and rooms were still not ready for check-in as the clock passed 5pm. Representative Leslie at the front desk was extremely rude; and was not willing to let us store our baggage while we waited for our room. Will never stay here again. [REVIEW_12] WOW! I've never seen an authentic Jazz concert until I came here! All Stars band was awesome! Very entertaining and definitely a must in NOLA. I love how they preserve the music genre. Very talented people! Place is small and will get packed! Buy your tickets online and get the assigned seating; or floor seating if you don't mind seating on the floor front row. Tip them please they deserve it. You can also do on-the-spot requests. No photography allowed during the show. And you can bring a drink from outside! [REVIEW_13] Simply the best.  Better than all the rest.  If you're lucky enough to have your car break during the St. Patrick's Day season; you can check out their amazing decorations.  Otherwise; they have several groovy fish tanks and an eclectic clientele to keep you entertained.  And of course; the quality of the work and the pricing are top notch. [REVIEW_14] We went here; on advice from a newspaper review.  What a disappointment!  The bread was like Wonder Bread; with a dipping ""marinara"" that was red just like sauce straight from a can; no simmering! The food all lacked flavor; and that is being very kind & considerate! [REVIEW_15] Taylor Home Solutions cleaned all the ducts in our rather large home; and then cleaned all the carpets; all in only four hours!  Of the eight quotes I received for carpet cleaning; Taylor Home Solutions was easily half the price of all other quotes in town! They were able to quickly schedule the cleaning and arrived on time; something that most companies do not do.  The carpets look brand new and the house smells clean! [REVIEW_16] Had the worst experience with the part owner woman that took off my acrylics yesterday. She literally shaved down with the drill my entire natural nail to the skin on 2 fingers completely and leaving spots of skin on other nails.  I am scared I will get an infection. I am left with very painful nails and very damaged nails. This place should be closed down for such inexperienced owners. I thought I had the best; since she said she was part owner. She totally did not know how to take off acrylics.If my fingers end up infected; trust me you will hear from me and I will make sure you are liable. [REVIEW_17] I purchased Maverick beef jerky peppered and the natural one and broke my tooth really bad. I spoke with them and they suggested giving me a gift card; I thought that was ridiculous. I suggest that the damn that they call the company that makes the product and see if there was any other issues with other customers about this. I'm sure they didn't do anything about it I'll check into it as far as I'm concerned. Concerned customer [REVIEW_18] Worst service in IL.  Lost our order; waited 25 minutes for an app.   They decided to start cleaning at 8pm.  Terrible;never going back to a Cheddars. [REVIEW_19] OMG- i can't believe that how these guys will ruined your food.. Very nasty service. Asked something got something. Always out for Lemon.. They don't care about customer that all I can say. Staff talking loudly..making unnecessary noise. Won't go back for sure.  KOP chipotle is the best one to visit. [REVIEW_20] Excellent service! They were super fast; friendly and professional.  This is now my go to place for oil changes [REVIEW_21] Food frozen with taste of freezer burn. Over priced for what you get. Nothing interesting everything is average food that can be purchased anyplace else for less money.  Love the interior everything else under average. [REVIEW_22] Came here for the first time on New Year's Eve for a burlesque show and really enjoyed both the show and the venue.  Drink prices were reasonable and the space was very cool. [REVIEW_23] BEST Indian food I have ever had. Their tikka masala is crazy good. Very cute little place in kind of a sketchy location; but definitely worth it!! [REVIEW_24] Let me start with the positives. This little restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside; but it's very cute and quaint on the inside. Our server was polite and friendly. He kept the soda refills coming; and did a good job overall. However; this is where the praise ends.  I went to this restaurant because I was in the area and wanted some Italian food. I saw the four star average reviews and figured it would be tasty. Be warned. It is WAY overpriced; and the food wasn't even good. The mozzarella sticks looked and tasted like the frozen ones you buy at the grocery store. They were $7.99 for five small sticks. Not worth it. Then came the entrees. Everything on the menu had cute names and sounded delicious. My husband ordered Chicken Parm; and I had the Baked Ziti. It was awful. I mean... not good at all. His chicken was ""ok;"" but not crispy on the outside like parm should be. Mine didn't have the brown; bubbly; cheesy top you'd normally see on baked ziti. The mozzarella cheese was barely even melted. The sauce tasted like it came from a jar. It was weak and not very flavorful. I had about five bites and didn't even take my leftovers home for the kids.   Save your money and go to Olive Garden instead. I like to support local businesses; but this was an unpleasant dining experience. Let me say again; it was ridiculously expensive and the food was just BAD. I seriously left there wishing I'd gone to McDonald's instead. [REVIEW_25] We ordered delivery because I'm sick at home. For $12 carnitas that was supposed to come with cilantro; onion and salsa; non of these was included. they came with only a little bit of meat in two taco shells and tasted unseasoned. My pork shoulder was very chewy and was supposed to come with pickles but didn't.  The beans; potato salad; and coleslaw were all filled less than half way. Only good things are the toasts. We will not order from this place ever again. [REVIEW_26] The best Jamaican food ever. Fresh and home cooked food. This is one of the better restaurants in Tampa; period. [REVIEW_27] They did a nice job renovating the place; but the service is awful. Worst of all; the pancakes were terrible - chewy and flavorless. Last time I'll come here. [REVIEW_28] fantastic!! Perfect for romantic dinners or meals with family or friends. Delicious traditional Italian everything. [REVIEW_29] I used to come here a lot. However I will not be coming here very often in the future because the customer service seems to be lacking. My online order did not go through and this was very disappointing; they made me stand in line again and re-order my food and did not offer me any type of discount or compensation for this disservice. I asked to speak to the manager who also did not offer me any kind of compensation. They don't seem to care about customer satisfaction instead they were fine with the fact that my online order did not go through. So if you're reading this Panera please take into account that you should work to satisfy your customers. We order online because we have small kids [REVIEW_30] I got the gyro ""platter"" for lunch; which was dry; uninspired; and nothing like a deconstructed gyro. Worst of all; it came with ""vegetables"" which looked more like poop. Tasted that way; too. There are better places in Fairmount for lunch; and they won't serve you poop; either.",10
47,"[REVIEW_1] Was once a great place to eat but I will not order from here again just got a stake and bacon sub all I found was raw fatty pieces of meat I'm guessing that was the bacon. Small pineapple and beef pizza well I really think the meat is old and no good because it was dry and the way the cheese was on the pizza it looked microwave. Being from the New York area originally this is NOT how they cook in ny. [REVIEW_2] Horrible food.  Bread sticks totally dry. Mozzarella sticks more salty than salt itself. And the worst tasting; bland; fettuccine alfredo ever.  Gave it a try despite the 1.5 stars but shouldn't have risked it. Wish I could give them a zero. [REVIEW_3] My family and I love Chipotle!   We choose this chain most often when considering fast food.   This particular location was terrible.   We ordered ahead and first of all the order was wrong.   And may I ask how does a Mexican restaurant run out of guacamole??   and run out of taco shells?  and run out of the pepper and onion stir fry mix?   Also; the service was very slow.   The food was thrown together and not in the usual way.    My son called to tell them about the order when he got home; and the person on the phone didn't care.   I have nothing good to say about this dining experience. [REVIEW_4] The drinks and the customer care are the only redeeming factor to this place. Not an authentic Mexican food- order chicken enchiladas without cheese or sourcream and the chicken was crunchy...like old rubber crunchy! Sent it back got beef tacos much better but the beans were super dry. The group said the beef was good. Probs wouldn't come back. [REVIEW_5] c can't figure out why this company has good reviews tried to set up an appointment for a cleaning he was very arrogant and rude wouldnot let me talk. just talked about his good reviews very poor customer service.  told me he don't give prices...that I had to. so I did and he hung  up. there are plenty of other cleaning companies  I can take this one off of my list  . .. [REVIEW_6] Went there yesterday the combo was almost 10.00 the burger was burned to a crisp;fries and drink were good when I told the cashier she said they all look like that baby so I threw everything including their little red basket in the trash.There was a couple of employees off the clock sitting in the restaurant cursing and laughing so loud that a few couples got up and left.No management or customer service skills in that entire place!Save your money and go and buy some fresh ground meat and make a real burger! [REVIEW_7] Best food in Northeast...amazing daily specials...love the Cuban pork egg rolls...try something different every time! [REVIEW_8] Best pho place in town! Their food was delicious and customer service was excellent. I just loved how friendly everyone was! [REVIEW_9] If I could give zero stars I would.  Service was slow and it wasn't busy. Order came out missing food. Place was disgustingly filthy. And the food....bland and super greasy. [REVIEW_10] Absolutely terrible service!!! Do not waste a nice day/evening in this beautiful town at this place [REVIEW_11] They charge $2 more for tomato mozzarella sandwich then the regular stand-alone Starbucks do. [REVIEW_12] Over price and pretentious hipster food . 4 bite of nothing on my small tasteless snapper.  The carnitas my daughter got where tasteless. [REVIEW_13] LUKE offers a great breakfast !  A bit on the pricey side for breakfast but definitely worth trying.  The breakfast menu has about 10-12 items and you can see a picture of it above.  We had the Basket of Beignets with chocolate sauce; the Homemade Yogurt; Biscuit Sandwich and Cup of Fruit.  All were great and our waiter Jackson provided excellent service. [REVIEW_14] I went to the drive thru hopefully I can get served so was at the speaker for half hour and lady had a attitude cause we asked if we could get service to say they had to change till and several cars left in the process I had to go home hungry that was totally sad luckily I not a diabetic [REVIEW_15] Eyebrow tech burned my eyelids using extra hot wax. Then said oh it's that red in everyone. Really? Beware [REVIEW_16] I have to get my prescriptions filled at CVS. As with any medical facility hand sanitizer should be offered to reduce transmission of disease.  There bottle of sanitizer has been empty for a week and I complained to the clerk who told me it is not for my use anyway.  I told her it should be because I am forced to use their disease ridden pen pad to sign for my prescriptions.  She then smugly said I was free to bring my own sanitizer.  I hate doing business with CVS and can't wait to transfer to Target. [REVIEW_17] I just leased a 2017 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited. The salesman was great.  Service; not so!  On a side note; I love how the manufacturer sends out a survey within days of buying a vehicle wanting to know how much you love the vehicle.  Not just jeep but they all do it.  I always respond with...give me 6 months to a year so I can drive it in different conditions.  Then I'll let you know.  I never respond with ""I love it"" in the first few days.  On my drive home from the dealership I noticed an excessive amount of wind noise coming from the passenger side roof area.  I know this vehicle isn't aerodynamic so don't go there. I understand! But the noise on the passenger side was far more noisy than the driver side.  So; I decided I was going to take it back to have it checked.  In the meantime; the blinker that is supposed to blink three times automatically when you move the lever up or down (not locked) worked intermittently.  Most of the time it did blink three times but occasionally it would only blink once.  So; I added this to the list.  They kept it for two days.  Famous quote...""nothing is wrong"".  So I asked; what did you do for two days.  The answer;  We drove it and the wind noise is normal and the blinker never malfunctioned. So I asked; do you believe me that the blinker occasionally malfunctions or do you think I'm making this up?  They said they believe me.  I asked: So if it did malfunction when you were driving it what action would you take?  It was like a dear looking at me in the headlights.  A blank stare.  He finally said he'd have to call technical service.  I asked why he didn't do that in the first place?  He said he had to diagnose it.  I asked; rather sarcastically; did you have some diagnostic equipment connected while driving it so that if it did happen you could troubleshoot it?  He said no; they just need to see it.  Unbelievable!  He said; as long as it doesn't happen for him; there is nothing wrong.  So; reluctantly on my part; we moved on to the wind noise.  Again; he said there was nothing wrong but...they put down a bead of silicone.  I asked why?  If there is nothing wrong; why put down a bead of silicone?  Because we felt it might help.  If there is nothing wrong and its; as you say; normal; why put down a bead of silicone?  Is there a problem or not?  No problem; we just decided to put down a bead of silicone.  A couple of weeks later (4th of July) I ran my jeep through a car wash in West Chester.  Within an hour; and on a 90+ degree day the A/C unit malfunctioned. Air flow went to a minimum.  I changed fan speed and while I could hear the fan increase in speed there was no change in output.  Minimal air flow and the vehicle started getting hot.  After about an hour and a half of this it finally began running properly again.  I called the dealership and told them what happened.  The answer; unless it does it for us we can't do anything about it.  Are you serious?  Are there louvers in the duct work?  Could one of them have gotten stuck?  Is there an area where water from a car wash could have affected or gotten into something to cause this?  Again; where is the diagnostics in all of this?  Simple answer is always; unless it happens for us we can't do anything about it.  Most frustrating group I've ever dealt with.  I HATE THIS JEEP and the fact there is not one competent person to work on it or someone who will take the initiative to diagnose the issues.  Worst purchase I ever made and what makes it so difficult is now that the sale is done; no one cares!  No one!  Oh; but the survey's keep coming.  Such a joke; an absolute joke.  Oh; to top it off; I was told to take it to David's Jeep in Glen Mills.  Perhaps they can find the problem.  Now that's a comforting thought. Just pass the problem on to someone else and in the meantime I'm having to run all over the place.  Never again. [REVIEW_18] So I'm quite certain I will never be returning to this restaurant. Upon walking in the manager greets us and asks where we were from. A friend of mine; and the only one amongst us from Louisiana; responded. The manager came back with a comment about my friend being from a trailer park when he heard where he was from (he's never lived in a trailer). So immediately not a good impression.  We get seated; the manager tells us our server is going to be male; a female shows up. Clearly bad communication. The waitress greets us and asks how we're doing and I return the question. She responds that she has been better. I'm a server and I know from experience; even if you're having a bad day; you don't show it or just come right out and say it.  The waitress suggests homemade hurricanes to drink. Two of the people in my party decide to try one. They were horrible. They were so potent u could hardly drink them. They definitely needed to add a little juice. Some cornbread with a honey sauce came to the table. It was very good! As an appetizer; the 4 of us split a sampler platter.... Which took 25 minutes to hit the table. The shrimp were good. The catfish was plain. The salmon patties were just OK. The red beans were pretty good. The turnip greens were very bitter. Overall not impressed.  For our entrees: One friend got the rib eye; it was undercooked. His wife got a blackened fish. The only reason the fish was ""blackened"" was because it was burnt. My fiancé got the jambalaya and catfish plate. The jambalaya was decent but the catfish was again plain. I had the shrimp scampi. It was pretty much the only positive thing about the whole meal besides the cornbread. Oh and did I mention it took 45 minutes after we finished our appetizer for the entrees to get there... [REVIEW_19] Nice to receive a message from Kerry @ the Whole Foods team. Promised to send a gift card due to the bad sausage. Never received. Guess she is just a person who pretends they care. [REVIEW_20] Wanted to try this place for the first time. We pick up a menu to order later. A few hours later we called for delivery. After placing our order we wanted to pay with a debit card. They told us they only take cards in the store. Delivery is cash only!!  I canceled the order and call gin house. [REVIEW_21] When I received my to-go order; I asked for a couple cups of water and tomato sauce.  The cashier said he needed to first take care of customers waiting to order; and he would call our number later.  Even after we finished our food 40 minutes later; we never heard him calling again.  I think we deserve better when we ordered $35 worth of food. [REVIEW_22] One recommendation: STAY AWAY FROM THE MARGARITAS!  For $5.00; you get a small cup of artificially flavored; watered down liquid that reminds me of the restaurant cocktail mix bottles sold at Bed Bath & Beyond.  A Mexican establishment; with a bar and expansive drink selection; should always serve decent margaritas - no exceptions.  And the service was just as awful.  Our waitress didn't fill up our water glasses once in the 3 hours we were there; and for our table of 4; she repeatedly got our drinks wrong (but because it took forever to get them; it wasn't worth asking her to correct the orders).   For the same price; I can go to Bakersfield and drink freshly squeeze lime juice with premium; smooth tequila; and it comes in a substantially larger size.  So you can guess where I will be the next time I have a hankering for margs... [REVIEW_23] I love takoyaki (octopus balls) and okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake) and almost always jump at the chance to order these when I can.  Sadly; Maru Global doesn't know how to make either.    I came here for dinner a while back and when I left; the remains of a half-eaten okonomiyaki lay on the table.  I am a beastly pig; and this for me; is kind of unheard of.  They aren't terribly well staffed here (at least when I came with a group of about 7); so if you order all at once in a large group; it takes quite a while for people to get to eat.    But on the food side; I ordered an okonomiyaki; and what I got was a pancake with a grainy; doughy texture; that was incredibly oversalted.  The consistency of the takoyaki was similarly off although I can't put my finger on what exactly was wrong.  Anyway; suffice it to say that I've had plenty of great octopus balls and Japanese pancakes elsewhere (like in New York; you can find this in the East Village in the form of Yakitori Taisho or; my fav; Otafuku; or in Philly there's Yakitori Boy).  This place just doesn't cut it; and I'm certain I won't be coming back. [REVIEW_24] This store has the worst customer service time and time again.   This morning I went in at 11am (when they open) and there were probably four other customers browsing the store. I turned the corner and the associate looking shocked said ""we don't open until 11."" I said it is 11 and her other associate said yeah it is 11. She then said well let me check. Comes back and said no one will be at register because they're closed. (The door to the front was open)  I asked if I could buy something and she looked at me like I was dumb and said ""ya.""   I was both confused and annoyed so I left.   Three times before this the service was also terrible. [REVIEW_25] Horrible. Waited over 2 hours for our order. Called the store 3 times- kept being told it was on its way. Pizza was under done and terrible. the manager said he would refund my order. Never gave a refund. I will be going in person tomorrow for a refund. [REVIEW_26] I have had several bad experiences with the Montgomery county SPCA. I never thought to look up reviews until now.  The woman who I believe may have been previously employed there pretty much nailed it. A few years ago I went to one of the branches trying to rescue a severely underweight Neapolitan mastiff. They told me verbatim that they wouldnt cat or dog test her and they go by the typical behavior of the breed.  They said it was a liability if one of the dogs or cats in the meet got injured.  That being said; the dog wouldn't be adopted out to a home with cats.  They also told me under no circumstances would they adopt out a pit bull mix to a home with other animals  That left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. They weren't even willing to work with me to save this dog.  This weekend we stopped into a different branch and fell in love with one of the pit bull mixes they had there.  Her kennel card said she was good with kids and dogs as she previously lived with both. She had been turned in about 48 hour prior to our visit due to the fact that her family was moving and couldn't bring her.  We Inquired about her at the reception area where they were MORE than friendly and eager to give us as much information as possible.  They had said she actually hadnt  had a behavior evaluation by a manager yet and that they expected that to happen within the next few days.  They also made a comment that since she was an am staff mix she would require an application. I found that to be a bit weird and wondered to myself if either of the 2 small dogs that tried to rip my head off would require the same. So; unable to control my excitement; I called today to see if she had her behavior test and to set up a meet with my resident dog. The woman said she had failed her evaluation and was no longer up for adoption.  She wasn't allowed to give me any additional information. We were heart broken. I feel like maybe if we were informed of her issues we could decide if it was something we were able to rehabilitate. I didn't understand why she had a kennel card with her information if she hadnt even been evaluated. Again; the staff there were more than willing to help and very pleasant. Even the woman on the phone thanked me for calling in.  I love the SPCA and all they stand for; but I feel like the Montgomery county SPCA is less tolerant of any kind of behavior issues and are more willing to euthanize for space rather than work with a dog whos issues may be minor. [REVIEW_27] Rude and unprofessional staff. I called today to find out if they had availability over the Thanksgiving holiday and the staff was short and basically said no then hung up the phone. I will take my business elsewhere. [REVIEW_28] Three Dog Night had a popular song that hit number 1 on the charts in the 70's. It was appropriately called ""One"". In the lyrics; it stated; ""One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do"". That may be true in love; but when it comes to dining sometimes you just want to dine alone.  If you do; avoid HWK.   Not once; but twice I have been turned  away when wanting to dine here as a single person. The first time when I called to make a reservation; the young lady who answered informed me they preferred not to sit single diners at tables and that I'd have to eat at the bar.  At first I was content with that arrangement; but then she continued to tell me that  those eating at the bar can not select from the entire menu. At that point; I decided not to make the reservation.  I wanted the true HWK experience. After all the reviews have been amazing.   The second time; I stopped in for early lunch while shopping the main drag in Maplewood.  Once again; I was told I'd have to sit at the bar and order from a ""limited menu"". When I asked if I could be seated at one of the hightops in the window; she told me she needed to save those for parties of two. The kicker came when I asked if they were already reserved and she said; ""no"".  I ate else where that day.   What I do not understand; is why can I go to Chicago dine at such top restaurants such as; Girl and the Goat; RL; The Pump Room; Table Fifty-Two; The Purple Pig; Frontera Grill and The Publican and be welcomed with open arms. Many of the chefs at these restaurants have been on Top Chef and published cookbooks.  How is it that their establishments are welcoming to the lone diner; yet a small Maplewood restaurant is not?  I understand they have a small space; but if you are going to sit single diners at the bar; let them order from the entire menu. Before posting; I shared this review with other friends who are single diners and being women; they said for them they would not feel comfortable eating at the bar and would not eat here if a table was not an option.   Disclaimer: I did dine here as a couple opening week and was not impressed. I contributed that to opening week jitters and wanted to give them another chance. It is a shame that I have not had that opportunity. [REVIEW_29] So it's 6:30 pm and all flights at the airport are delayed due to weather. This pizza place is right in the middle of the terminal so it's a good place to grab a bite. Here's the problem. They have no food! I ordered a salad and was told ""we are all out of salads""; then I ordered a slice of margarita pizza and was told that all that is available is pepperoni or cheese. The lady behind me wanted garlic knots; they were out. The place was empty at first so it's not like they sold out. They just didn't stock well. They have one kid working there and he makes one pizza at a time. Don't have a menu up if only 2 of the 11 items are offered! The pizza was fine but it was really a strange experience. [REVIEW_30] I had one of the top three worst restaurant experiences of my life here. One example is that my wife got a lukewarm burrito and sent it back after talking with the manager. The burrito came back partly eaten....by the chef....as the manager said she has the chef taste things when complained about....AND SHE BROUGHT THIS BURRITO BACK TO OUR TABLE...THE MANAGER  (who said she is part of the founding family). This is after waiting more than 90 minutes for our food. On top of that; the food is mediocre at best. Now I've read El Charro is selling burritos at 7-Eleven stores in California....enough said. Do yourself a favor and go to Poco and Mom's or even Guadalajara Grill. El Charro is WAY past its expiration date and those running it now no longer know how to serve excellent; or even decent; Mexican food.",3
48,"[REVIEW_1] The pizza had no taste and the wings that I ordered didn't even come buffalo; they came plain which I know for a fact I asked for mild wings... even the chicken was flavorless. Won't be ordering again. [REVIEW_2] Old World Coffee. Where to start?  I don't drink coffee very much. Okay; I don't drink coffee at all. My drink of preference would be hot cocoa; occasionally spiced. I never doubt the quality of the drink here; because the milk is really quite good. Also; some of the baristas here have some stunning latte art. Don't know what that is? You should ask one of them; they're all very experienced with what they're talking about. That's another great reason to come here - not only is there quality of service; but there's also friendliness. The baristas are always very kind; helpful; and informative about what it is they do.   Not only is everything about the service great; the atmosphere is really cool too. I often find the art that they put up on their walls interesting and unique; and they change it out about once a month. The wood and white theme they have going on is very aesthetically pleasing; as well as nicely calming.   This is definitely one of my favorite places to go! [REVIEW_3] I've been going to Body Cycle for about a year! The instructors are AWESOME; they work hard to know who you are and provide an amazing workout.  I go three times a week and get my ass kicked everytime and I am in the best shape of my life.  The classes are scheduled such that even the busiest of people are able to get to a class. [REVIEW_4] Place is top notch for the area - and so is the pricing.  If you want classy then you can't go wrong here.  Been a few times and always had a good meal.  I can't say much that put its in a different class then the other local stake houses though.  One thing to note is their 'happy hours'.  I've had several meetings at the bar during that time (5:00 to 6:30?) where the drinks are $6 and so are their 'Bar Bites' menu.  They have mini crab cake; burger and stake sandwiches - three of each for $6.  The burger and stake sandwiches are rib-eye I believe and really good.  They also have $2 oysters.  All in all - You can get a $195 shot of Lewi and a $175 porterhouse or a decent $6 sandwich and all with the same great service.  **Please do the rest of us a favor and don't bring your kids here.  Thank you!** [REVIEW_5] Excellent deep dish pizza. Prolly the best local pizza in St. Louis. Come early on thur-sat night as it takes a long time to cook. [REVIEW_6] Really amazing place. Definitely worth the visit but will be a more expensive outing! We got their  around 4:00 on Sunday and it was already packed - would highly recommend getting there earlier to make sure you get a table!! The cheese board was delicious and gorgeous - the menu food smelled amazing too. Loved it here!! [REVIEW_7] ""High Score!""...unfortunately I wasn't playing a video game with my friends; but rather wracked up the highest weight for my frozen yogurt. Why did is ""win"" this completely made up competition? Because this place is THAT good. Seriously; everything tastes great and even the fat-free options still feel like I'm splurging on my constant being-a-girl diet. The location is great if you're out an about on South Street and need something sweet. :) [REVIEW_8] What a great place.  The history and the secluded location alone make it great but the food is actually terrific.  Great fish and steak.  You have to try this place.  It's like traveling back in time; just wonderful; especially for kids to enjoy the grounds and the hisotry of it.  It would be best to come here during daylight hours so you can tour the site and see everything they have.  After dark; it's very hard to see anything since they do not  have a lot of light here. [REVIEW_9] This is my third allergist in Reno.  This guy is super smart and up on all the latest studies.  He is a great doctor. [REVIEW_10] Everything about this place makes me SOOO happy. From the staff to the food to the patio - there are a few reasons why I have been here almost as many days I've been in Nashville. Keep it up y'all! [REVIEW_11] Amazing biscuits and (fill in the blank). Great cocktails too. Highly recommended. A bit busy though. [REVIEW_12] Hands down; my favorite restaurant in Nashville. The menu is always changing; so there is always something new to try every time I come back!  Not only are the dishes unique and intriguing; but they are executed perfectly every time. I've brought so many guests here when they come to visit and everyone always raves about it. We always include an order of whipped feta with our meal; which never disappoints.   The service can be a bit hit or miss at times; but even still; the food makes up for it!  If you're visiting Nashville; I recommend trying this place out instead of some of the other more popular tourist spots. If you live in Nashville and haven't yet come here; then make a reservation and try it out soon! [REVIEW_13] This place has dabomb.com Alfredo Nachos #sogood. Great service every time my girlfriend and I go! Favorite place whenever we go to Nashville. Highly recommend [REVIEW_14] My family's favorite Thai place for any occasion. We have been going there for over 3 years. Great service; food is always delicious. Highly recommend! [REVIEW_15] The manager Shawn Bracken and our waiter clearly care about their customers and the entire experience at PF Chang's. They went above and beyond on a busy night to make sure we were taken care of. Will definitely be coming back to this location. (Also recommended the Korean chicken which is not on the menu but is phenomenal) [REVIEW_16] BEST. SUSHI. IN. TOWN. The place itself doesn't look like anything special; a few table and a sushi bar. However; the fish is always fresh and well prepared. If you're into sauces and fish combinations in a single roll; this might not be the place for you. The chirashi is priced very well during lunch and the portions are generous.   For an authentic Japanese restaurant in town; this is it. [REVIEW_17] It's a popular past-time to evaluate Bridgewater's only in its train station context. This is; of course; fair. But try this on for size... Bridgewater's is the best bar for 10 blocks in either direction on Market; an important street in our fair city. I'd have to really sit down with a map; by they might be the best bar in a 50 square block radius (I know; there's not much in that radius; but still).  I've never had anything but fresh beer (and a good selection); tasty food (it is pub fare; to be fair); and friendly service. The ambiance is good enough--it's kinda like the Epcos center in Disneyworld. There; you know you're in a theme park; but the little country stands are convincing enough that if you want to believe; you can feel like you're on another continent. Bridgewater's is like that... if you want to believe; you don't have to feel like you're in a train station.  They apparently have a rotating menu; so if you fall in love with something there; you better make sure it will still be there next time you come back.    Even if you don't take the train; this is worth the trip. [REVIEW_18] I attended this place for the first time yesterday afternoon. After breaking one nail yesterday morning; by the end of the day I had broken every single one (Once it happens to one; it's game over. Ya feel me ladies?) Anyways; I was able to make an appointment online; and get in right after work.   The place is so quaint and cute. The decor is perfect shabby chic; and so calming. They have a good color selection; but not too many where they hand you a bucket of 300 colors that all look the same for you to dig through. I appreciated that! It gets too overwhelming. The girl I made an appointment with wasn't quite done with her prior client; and one of the owners starting soaking off my nails. AMAZING. And so so sweet. The conversation was great; and most importantly; my manicure looks amazing. I had dip on prior to coming in; so my nails were incredibly weak; so she gave me some tips and was so careful.  Overall; amazing experience. Definitely recommend! [REVIEW_19] Jay's is my favorite place to get sushi take-out in center city.  As far as the 3 rolls for $xx.xx deals go (there are many in the area); I've tried quite a few and this is my favorite due to the price; quality; and unique selection.  They have rolls I haven't seen anywhere else.  I haven't tried the other menu selections at Jay's; so this review is based only on that.  If you want to eat in; it's not fancy and a little cramped; but everyone was very friendly and the sushi was still good.  For now; it's my #1 take-out place (I suppose Vic would be #2; for reference).  For the fancy sushi experience; I recommend Umai Umai. [REVIEW_20] Let me start by saying that the food here is by far the best Mexican I have had in St Pete.  It's nothing fancy and very small but if your looking for some good food and a beer this is the place to go to. Weekend nights do get a little hectic so I would recommend going on a weekday night or during the day so you can skip the long wait to place your order. For the meat lovers out there you can't go wrong with a chorizo taco and for the seafood junkies the fish tacos are amazing! [REVIEW_21] Whenever we want the best sushi in town we have to come here. We almost always get the sashimi and sushi combination; along with a couple different orders of nigiri.   Always amazing and worth the high price. [REVIEW_22] Home Wine Kitchen is hands down one of the best restaurants in St. Louis; and its ""No-Menu Monday"" is a must try!  After giving our sever some insight on our food preferences; my boyfriend and I were presented with dishes that were SPOT ON to our tastes.  The food was absolutely amazing; and the restaurant was super accomodating to my stricter-than-usual dietary preferences (vegan).  Actually; they gave me the best vegan meal I have had in STL to date; my boyfriend was also super satisfied with his meatier fare.  Thank you; Home Wine Kitchen; we will be back!  (Note:  Make sure to make a reservation!) [REVIEW_23] Local diner style restaurant; with a menu reminiscent of what you would find in NY or Chicago Greek diners. It is a staple with many Temple Terrace residents.   The food is good; the staff pleasant and the portion sizes an incredible value. Everything is cooked fresh to order.   Try it; you'll like it. [REVIEW_24] It's been 10 years since I've been to a Shoney's; and I'll never eat at a Shoney's again. The people working there are nice and I honestly feel for them. The food was disappointing; though not inedible. The $11.99 buffet is a poor excuse for a buffet; we might have done better to just order something from the menu. I went with my wife and two kids on a Saturday evening and although they didn't appear to be that busy; it took 15 minutes to get a table and another 20 minutes to pay at the counter once we were done eating.   I don't really enjoy eating at Waffle House; but I would have had a much better experience at the Waffle House across Briley  I'm sure. [REVIEW_25] The shrimp poboy was out of this world. And the white chocolate bread pudding was delicious. There's no drive-in option: take out only. [REVIEW_26] There were five of us;we were planing a Bridal shower. Our waitress was Taiya she was amazing;I think she had just as much fun with us as we did with her.  My daughter and I both had a full rack of Ribs so  juicy and covered with barbecue sauce;coleslaw and fries. Had the Fallen Cherry Stout loved it;the brewmaster Doug is the best. Can't forget the bartender Kelsey love her very friendly. [REVIEW_27] The Loew's hotel is very clean and looks very nice. The service is amazing. My family and I wanted to stay for a whole month. The breakfast there is fantastic! My son said it looked like it was the future. That's how nice it was! The rooms were nice size and the parking is convenient. That's why I give the Loew's hotel 5 stars. [REVIEW_28] Food was fantastic; view perfect; atmosphere is quaint. It was a gorgeous day to sit in the patio we had the corned beef eggs and hash; and the banana foster French toast as well as a burger; it was all delicious! The waitress was super sweet also. [REVIEW_29] If yo've never been here before; go. If you've been here before; go. Hands down the mouth (and stomach) of the South. INCREDIBLE FOOD. [REVIEW_30] Still waiting for the gift card apology that was promised. Maybe their oversight or just a comment on Yelp! to make customer service appear better.  It has been almost 6 months and still no gift card. Customer service not a priority here.",27
49,"[REVIEW_1] Gave them another try today ... SMDH .... how does this place stay open .... customer service non existent always out of something or something not working ... really don't know how they even stay open .. I would be embarrassed to own this location [REVIEW_2] Everyone here is so nice. They had 3 employees working and they all greeted each customer. They explained their different cupcakes but I kept it simple with a red velvet and and wedding cake. The cupcakes were great. I can't wait to go back and try some different one.   Great experience. A MUST GO! [REVIEW_3] I loved my dinner at Aldine last weekend. I give the food; the service; and the ambiance all five stars. The highlights were the pastina with wild mushrooms (on the menu); pasta with boar; and mushroom; barley; egg dish (both were specials--they had fancier names than what I listed but I can't recall). Really interesting flavors; all of them. Also; tried two very interesting brews from Tired Hands Brewery. The servers were friendly and professional. And; the very special treat was that we could hear each other speak (which seems to have become rare or maybe my hearing is just getting worse). I am already planning my return trip. This place is going in my top five with Zahav; Fitler; Barbuzzo; and ... ok my top four. [REVIEW_4] Came here with the team one night so we shared a few things. The French 75 is a NOLA classic cocktail and must be tried. The kuchen flatbread is fantastic. We got the PJ Oysters and they were amazing; I preferred the raw but the fried were good too. The Luke Salad is absolutely amazing. The shrimp ettouffe is served with amazing homemade pasta. (I can't spell; my apologies) The gnocchi is made on premises and also great. Finally; many folks at the table got the matzo ball soup. It was good. The matzo balls were a little mushy on the outside but good and good texture in the center. Our server (maybe Elliot?) was great and reminded me of Crispin Glover/Cillian Murphy. Highly recommend. [REVIEW_5] It's our go-to place. Great pancakes!! Quick; friendly. We usually go for breakfast but went for lunch the other day; loved the burger. [REVIEW_6] The Habit Burger is a straight up legit burger place.  It's always been a toss up for me between in n out and habit burger.  I got me a double char and choco shake at the goleta habit and it was as usual; delicious.  The onion rings are very good also. [REVIEW_7] Worth the wait and the hype- get the old fashioned buttermilk pancakes with a side of bacon and fruit- I topped my pancakes with bananas and will now die happy. Those pancakes are what dreams are made of! [REVIEW_8] Three letters; WOW!  Food was excellent and relatively cheap for the FQ.  Our waitress Kerry was excellent.  I had the big easy breakfast which came with lots of food that I could not finish.  The pancakes were the best part of the meal.  Glad we skipped the hotels breakfast of pastries to eat here.  I would highly recommend! [REVIEW_9] We visit every weekend for breakfast; it's a very nice and cozy cafe with good food and great service. Free wifi too! We recommend it 100%. [REVIEW_10] Yum and yum.   What a cute place w great food!  Have been twice and will be back again soon.   The burger; the crème brûlée pork belly special; are two instant faves.   I almost don't want people to know about this place so it doesn't get over crowded! [REVIEW_11] This is my husband's favorite brunch place. It's hard to get him to go anywhere else! Their yogurt parfait is the absolute best in the city. Their specials are always creative; and on point. Food is consistently delicious. The thing I love most about Ants Pants is the portioning of the food. Some brunch places give you nonsensical portions; and I always feel bad; because I feel like I'm wasting food. Ants Pants gives you very reasonable portions. We always have the same server; and he is super sweet and attentive; even when he's the only one there! [REVIEW_12] Eclipse Pizza has been our favorite pizza place for years. Try the Ironman Pizza and the carrot cake! [REVIEW_13] I wasn't a fan after several failed tries; however; if you get Steve you'll be satisfied.  He was very diligent about keeping me posted on what they were doing with my truck.  He turned a very negative into a positive.  If you have my wallet you already have my attention.  So; all I ask is let's make this work.  Steve did that extremely well and he's very friendly.  Thanks for all you did.  I feel this company is really making that extra effort to keep the customer happy.  In the future; I'll bring them my business.  Management has shown they will try everything to make this work.  Cheers. [REVIEW_14] Co-workers and I placed a big order. The meal in particular was an apple cinnamon pancake with eggs and bacon for $9.99. When made thr fool mistake of trusting that everything was going to be correct with the order and when we finally opened the bag at work in that order was the pancake.. Can you imagine spending $10 on 1 pancake?? Well I called this establishment the following morning because they close at 2:30 and was instantly bombarded with negativity and rudeness from the lady who answered who placed blame on everyone else and then said JUST COME GET THE EGGS AND BACON... The rudest I've encountered in a while. [REVIEW_15] Is it odd to love a laundromat so much?! I go out of my way just to go to this laundromat! The owner and staff here are so helpful and genuinely nice! It's impeccably clean and maintained! Can't say enough good things about this place! [REVIEW_16] DISCLAIMER: this review is limited exclusively to my single experience last night eating prawn mee noodle soup at Penang.  Review: this dish was admittedly very fishy; which I was generally okay with. It almost tasted like the restaurant added fermented shrimp paste or something similar. That's also not an issue; in itself. However; it is now 8pm; and I have still not yet left my hotel room since getting back from Penang last night. I'm currently having the absolute worst food poisoning experience of my life.  According to my primary care physician; aka WebMD; it is likely that I have some form of aggressive salmonella food poisoning.  The other dishes looked good; and I'm sure the prawn mee is typically not vomit/diarrhea-inducing; but i hope this issue is addressed promptly. [REVIEW_17] Very friendly and helpful staff. The dentists are very professional. Clean office and modern equipment. I feel like I'm an actual patient here and not a dollar sign. [REVIEW_18] This hotel is so dog friendly we love it...everyone is so nice just stayed this weekened loved it...they serve starbucks coffee;beautiful room and pool;  I would only stay here in the area ... such a nice staff... The nighttime mgr is a young lady who is especially nice she helped us check in and throughout our stay...hotel is so clean...   beautiful so conveinant to everything love it... [REVIEW_19] This establishment is the absolute worst place I have ever been. A few friends and I went there on Saturday Nov. 29th to karaoke and have some dinner. The food was just nasty and not worth the money. As far as the karaoke went; we were enjoying ourselves when this drunk obnoxious idiot named Derrick got up and very loudly screamed out a song and it was very offensive. It included the f--k word numerous times. He was about 21. Not cool. Then we found out thst this punk was the manager!!! He showed no respect for anyone else there. Then he got more drunk. When we complained to the owner he said ""he's just having fun"". Like he condones this kind of thing!! Ridiculous!! Then the owner accused us of not buying anything and told us to take our business elsewhere! We all bought dinner!!! This place is definately not worth your time and the food sucks! I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you like drunk punks who think they are all that. Don't bother. They could care less!! When I tried to post this it wouldn't let me unless I chose a star rating. I tried to give one star so I could post this. It highlighted all the stars!!! I didn't want to give them any stars. THEY SUCK!!!!! [REVIEW_20] The TV shows are $4.99 and they have commercials! What a cheesy way to make money and a sign of a less than classy hotel; particularly when you pay more than $150 a night.  And there is NO complimentary breakfast; just an overpriced buffet; something even the cheapest hotels in California provide. [REVIEW_21] At first I was not happy about how long it took for our food to come. However; the manager and wait staff were great and did the best they could but ultimately it was worth the wait. Omg! The food was absolutely delicious!!!!!! Quite possibly some of best the Asian cuisine I have ever had and my God what a cheap eat. It came to $23 for two. I had some spicy curry beef dish with coconut rice and I was in heaven. Whenever I'm in town this will be a definite go to and a serious recommend for out of towners. [REVIEW_22] I have been getting waxed here for years and have been satisfied with the services. The staff is cordial and professional. Today; however; was something different. Tyisha is a gifted aesthetician. She is thorough and careful. The wax was the perfect temperature and the removal painless. This woman is a revelation. I had a new spring in my step walking out today! I'll never go to anyone else. Thank you Tyisha! [REVIEW_23] This place was amazing! I only tried their ice cream I really wanted to try the hot chocolate but didn't get a chance :(. Well the ice cream was great! The first night I came here I got a brownie sundae all for myself; brownie on the bottom and three scoops of ice cream topped with whipped cream and nuts. I finished it all happily! I chose pumpkin cake flavor which was delicious and smooth. I also got pralines and cream that was better than other praline ice creams. The Tennessee fudge was vanilla with fudge swirled it was good not too special.   The next time I came I got nutter butter ice cream that was really good had cookie pieces in it! I got the hot fudge topping over it and that was a great combination.   The service was great the workers were really nice and patient with me haha indecisive! They would joke around with me and let me sample all I wanted. Also no judgement for eating all the brownie sundae alone :) lol [REVIEW_24] New owners bring true pride of ownership.  The place is small but had pretty much all you need.  If you are looking for a small; less busy; no screaming muscle monsters; check out this place.  Open 24 hrs.  Price is about $30/ month.  I will never go back to LA Fitness.     New owner Mike is fantastic.  He just painted the inside and front of the building himself.  The place is meticulous and he is friendly and knowledgeable.  You just can't beat what you get for the money.  Plus; it's open all the time for members.   Now we that is convenient! [REVIEW_25] Walking up upon the Schermerhorn Symphony Center; you can't help to marvel at the beauty of the statues and facade. The classic Romanesque architecture is as compelling in size as its design.   For my first symphony; I attended the free yearly symphony this past Saturday. Having a deep understanding of modern and contemporary music; my sense of audio innocence for this show provided a pure experience.   During the first piece; I was overwhelmed by the senses of emotion from the insight into sounds surreal. Each successive song brought me to a different state of emotion. Sadness and pain - comfortableness - excitement and joy.  The acoustics of the hall are simply and totally consuming. You feel completely surrounded by sound. Although we sat directly center of the stage; we noticed that the balcony's were also reacting in applause in a similar manner. I bet the view from there is more amazing. You could then see each musician as they added their contribution to the influence over your feelings.  Walking around the outside gardens; you really begin to notice the architecture. There are flowers and fountains adorning many areas of the facility.   Its without saying; you must consider attending a symphony here once in your life. I still have little knowledge about who wrote what; the name of the piece/song/tune. However; I do know that the experience rivaled nearly every concert I have attend. And I have: There are many shows under my belt.   There was a new appreciation and connection to sound that I left with that transforming evening... [REVIEW_26] Great spot in the heart of the French Quarter. Do yourself a favor and don't consider ordering anything other than the BBQ shrimp. If you look up the recipe; it's shrimp that's DROWNING in a flavorful butter sauce and; as you'd expect; it's AMAZING. Worth a stop for lunch or dinner when you're in NOLA. [REVIEW_27] Tried ordering online. When I asked for topping suggestions the guy hung up on me. Ridiculous [REVIEW_28] Yummy food;  they will veganize things for you as well. The servers are friendly and the restaurant is spacious and has a bar and a stage area. We have had our work Holiday party here for the past couple years; both parties turned out great. The guacamole is awesome! [REVIEW_29] Had to wait over 2 hours for food! Delivery drivers don't know their way around and can't seem to knock on a door. This store is pathetic. I will NEVER order from this location again. [REVIEW_30] One of my go-to lunches:  toasted italian sub.  Delicious and the staff is always very friendly.",24
50,"[REVIEW_1] Rude employees. Suggested I was lying about trying to place an online order online with cash as an option. I could not use cash as the option as a ""guest"" and I did not want to create an account as I usually use much higher quality pizzerias when I am looking for a pie. I understand this is just a chain store but as a costumer you still expect to not be treated rudely. [REVIEW_2] Bomb.com! I forget what I ordered but it was similar to a Cuban sandwich on donut bread. My friend ordered a cinnamon sugar donut while she waited for her actual food and that was delicious. I ate everything because it was amazing and deserves all the hype it has received. I need to go back and try those stuffed donuts. [REVIEW_3] Against my first instinct; we decided to reserve a taxi cab to the airport. Although they were courteous on the phone when we needed the cab earlier; the taxi driver was so rude; cab #6. He didn't answer our greetings; he was driving at 70mph on a 45 zone and he didn't bother to check for road work in his huge GPS ; which led us to take another road and ended up paying more than we expected; he had the nerve to get upset because HE didn't check his route before hand. I didn't care to tip him and I will definitely never use them again. I feel robbed. [REVIEW_4] Came for the first time today with family and Bailey was excellent; she was friendly and attentive and THE FOOD was incredible. We had the hummus plate (which was very generous portion); the pretzels; mozzarella sticks and caprese salad. Everything was fresh and I was impressed with the food as I had never been here before. We will be back!! [REVIEW_5] This place is a vegetarian's dream! Food is great and their portion sizes are large. Although it is slightly over-priced; I highly recommend it (for meat-eaters too!). My personal favorite is the Crispy Ranch Chikn. I get it every time! [REVIEW_6] So disappointing.....after living in the area for many years and ate there on many occasions I decided to stop for lunch. What I discovered that it is now fast food Mexican with no regaurd to your choice of toppings! Disgusting and not worth my money or time any longer..... So many better ""quick"" eats on the westside that probably would have been better - no more visits for me!  p.s. would've asked for a refund. But in this day and age didn't want to start any drama - [REVIEW_7] I was staying a week in Marigny near the French quarter and just walked in off the street. The manager James was amazing and very helpful. The chef; Richard; suggested the grits ( which I usually don't like) so he brought us out two bowls to try ( for free). A-mazing.    We ordered Breakfast Ya Ya and the crayfish omelet with bloody marys. The food was perfect and drinks strong. They put pickled greenbeans instead of celery which was really unique.   The service was attentive without being suffocating and I am definitely coming back before we leave. [REVIEW_8] Yes! I love this place! Maple Street Patisserie is the bomb.com! I've never been disappointed. Best blueberry muffin I've ever had in my whole entire life. Delicious breakfast and lunch spot. They also do specialty cakes so swing by during Mardi Gras and grab a king cake. Also the owner; Ziggy; is the man. He's always running around working crazy hours to make all these scrumptious baked goods. Can't beat this place :) [REVIEW_9] 1) carpet is sticky 2) didn't give us enough towels 3) phone doesn't work to call down to front desk 4) we asked them to clean our room five times; never happened 5) asked for sheets and blankets for the pull-out bed at least eight times; never happened. Don't waste your money here. [REVIEW_10] I had not visited Perlis in over thirty years and I now remember why.   My mother used to bring me there when I was growing up. My relatives shopped there too ; it was THE place that all of the old well to do familys of New Orleans went.       As a child ; I never noticed the rudeness ; I guess because it was my mom who had to work with the attendants while I sat board.   At twenty three ; I had not yet purchased my own suits ; and was still wearing the ones my mother had bought for me in my early years.    As a Twenty two year old I was a little intimidated as I walked in and saw the well dressed ; sofisticated attendants . I remember receiving glares and a very rude ; sarcastic  "" may I help you  "" from what appeared to be the man in charge at the time.   The rest of the visit didn't get any better. The attendant had a rude arrogance about him ; as though he was doing me a favor even speaking to me .  He obviously did not remember me from the last ten years of business that my mother had given them ; or maybe he did and just didn't care .  I suppose that having established themselves as THE place to buy clothing ; they had developed an attitude of superiority ; but to what ; or who ? These guys sell clothes for gods sake ; who are they superior to ?      This attitude has NOT changed.     A month ago ; I decided to see if a quarter century had brought about anything positive in the way of attitude.  My treatment was no different from that of my visit in 1982.  One of my attendants ( the head guy that day)  ; had the same arrogance as I remembered from years past.  His desire was to put me in what HE thought was best and displayed a sneer at my taste ; ( wich is quite conservative in nature and right up their alley ).     I ended up getting three pairs of pants ; one of which needed to be left for tailoring. I was told that I would be called when they were ready.     Four weeks had gone by with no call ; so I called them.  The mans tone on the end of the line was one of a person insulted . It seems that I was the one in error for having waited that long before calling ; and my tardiness was the insult.  How dare I suggest that Perlis would not have the work done in a week!!!    "" We always do "" ; he said.  "" May I ask who your attendant was  "" ?   ""  I don't remember "" I replied .            Then  ; with a VERY sarcastic  "" we'll do you remember the color  ; sir "" ?  ; with the sarcastic emphasis on sir.    "" I really don't ; it was a moth ago  ; and I bought them purely on a whim "" ; I replied .     "" Well wait just a minute SIR and I'll go look"" .      It was then that ; wether by mistake or on purpose ;  I heard him say as the phone left his ear for the counter  ; "" STUPID IDIOT "" !!                It was 30 minutes later that went through the door of Perlis for the last time.   There to greet me with same snied. ; "" may I help you sir "" ;  was the man I had spoken with on the phone. In my minds eye ;  I was expecting to see someone like those who I had seen the month before ; someone about 45 ; dressed to the old New Orleans nines ; but to my surprise it was a much older fellow ; short in stature ; and wearing a suit that I can only describe as strangely old fashioned ; like something the duke of Windsor might have worn in 1968.  It's funny ; I remember a picture from my childhood of a chimpanzee in a plaid suit very similar to the one he was wearing.  The picture was a spoof of a used car salesman if I recall.      While handing me the trousers he said ; in his now standard ; and rather lyrical sarcastic tone ; "" come again SIR ""  .   Not wanting confrontation ; I muttered ; "" not likely "" as I left their store for good.       I really don't know where these guys get off acting this way!?  Is business so good that they can treat customers with such disrespect and still gain new customers over the years?  That just doesn't add up.  I am sure I can't be alone in my experience. I wonder how many hundreds of thousands of dollars thes strangely arrogant people have lost over the decades by insulting customers this way?      Old man Perlis had better take heed of the fact that anyone can get anything in his store over the internet ; and for less. [REVIEW_11] This is another one of those anytime coffee shops. You can come get some work done; people watch; or just grab a drink to go. Either way; its open early and late.  For the quarter; its ""off the beaten path"" but in the busy area the locals hang out; and on the way to Fenchmen where everyone goes for good local music; Jazz; et al.   They have food; not the cheapest; or local; but its better for you than the greasy; salty; fatty foods. Just make sure your service number is visible I got distracted hid my number; and had to stop the guy looking.    Service varies. Since its a busy sidewalk; people stop in for that pick me up before work or party. One minute there is a like 12 long; and the barista is running ragged; the next its dead.   Sometimes I'll sit for over an hour working or catching up on email. I'll order something every so often; and its no big deal for me to queue myself if they get busy. After all it helps those stopping in for a quick drink.  p.s. I love there tall cookies  oh and how many coffee shops can you get a shot in your coffee! That's right; its not a bar; but its New Orleans. [REVIEW_12] Phenomenal pizza! The sauce is delicious & the crust on their Pizza is unmatched in STL! Don't even get me started on the cheese they use! Absolutely perfect & one of our favorite places to stop for a Sunday splurge! [REVIEW_13] Food wasn't great; way overpriced; waitress complained about a 10% tip.  The tomato soup tasted like pasta sauce ($13) both in texture and flavor.  The chicken was burnt on our quinoa and kale salad. ($20)  Skip the pulled pork sandwich; it has a weird flavor... possibly from the onion roll. [REVIEW_14] Really poor seating management. 6:00 on a Sunday and the hostess has seated several parties of 2 at 4 tops leaving all the small tables open and no tables for larger parties. Then suggests I go eat at the bar with my minor children. [REVIEW_15] Don't shop here! The main manager here is a total bitch; I wore a pair of Levi shoes to school for one class; the shoes tore into the back of my heel to the point of bleeding and blistering; I went to return the item and was told I could not; even after explaining that we had asked the return policy BEFORE buying the shoes; to which the employee only told us we had 30 day; which is complete LIE; you have 30 days if they are totally unworn... how are you supposed to tell if the quality of the shoe is okay if you don't ware them? What if the glue peels or they completely fall apart? You are suckered into buying them and then you are told you are completely SOL if the shoe is of very bad quality. The manager needs to be fired; no managerial skills whatsoever; who trained her; Hiter? Again I strongly urge you to buy shoes from a better store! [REVIEW_16] Very unhappy with the treatment we received today. After eating a Sushi Rose since it opened up; and their parent restaurant Asian Wok next door; we have never had a sushi chief be so rude and inhospitable. Flower was the acting manager today. She almost permanently lost our business had it not been for the kind service of the waitress. [REVIEW_17] Had booked rooms a month in advance for a bachelor party. Waited for 2 hours and rooms were still not ready for check-in as the clock passed 5pm. Representative Leslie at the front desk was extremely rude; and was not willing to let us store our baggage while we waited for our room. Will never stay here again. [REVIEW_18] My girlfriends and I went for the Happy Hour and it was AMAZING.  The service was great from start to finish.   e all ordered some cocktails to start as well as 2 dozen oysters (raw and grilled). We also ordered a variety of sides to share: pate; brussels sprouts; grits; and fries.  Our table raved about all the sides particularly the brussels sprouts were sweet and caramelized (perfection).  We went another round of oysters before we asked for the check. The oysters were so fresh.  I can't wait for the next opportunity to venture back for another meal here. [REVIEW_19] Had pulled pork with collard greens and sweet potatoe​  fries.  The pulled pork was tasteless and watery; the collard greens was hot. My wife sent her collard greens back and got onion rings;  which were ok. The sweet potatoes fries were ok as well. [REVIEW_20] I received a vase of flowers for Mother's Day and they are terrible. I'm sure my son paid top dollar; because he always does. But this very small bouquet had only three roses that never opened and wilted within two days. The rest of the arrangement was cheap filler flowers. It came in a plain glass vase with dirty water and no bow or ribbon. They forgot the candy that came with it and had to deliver it later in the day. Look elsewhere if you are looking to send an impressive gift; because this one was not. [REVIEW_21] It pains me to rate anyone a single star; but I really was disappointed with my meal at Market Grill last night and won't be back.    We; a three-some; went on the recommendation of an acquaintance.  First impression walking in the door; smoke-free (yay!) and beautiful original brickwork; but a really scrubbed-clean feeling.  Which is good; or could be.  Maybe it just felt out of place in Soulard :).    From there it was all downhill.  The menus we were given were dog-eared; ripped; with pen marks and spots of indeterminable provenance.  Poor impression.  Print some new menus.    We were not offered a drink list.  When I asked for the drink list; the server said; ""We don't have a drink list; but I can get you a wine menu.""  But there is a neon Bud Light sign in the window.  If you don't have a list printed; use your voice and tell me what you offer.  A note on the wine menu: sorted into reds and whites.  Fair enough.  Beneath the reds?  The whites.  And beneath the whites?  The reds.  Print some new menus.  And considering the venue; their wine pricing is high.  The server made no effort to sell us drinks.    The food.  The first thing the server told us was that they were out of the soup of the day.  Ok; fine; benefit of the doubt; it must have been excellent and super-popular; right?  We started with hummus - not my choice.  Did not meet expectations.  I ordered meatloaf.  It was surprisingly dense and rather dry - full of filler.  The mashed potatoes looked more like mashed hash browns; I don't quite know how to describe them.  The green beans had to have come from a freezer bag.  And the fried onion & jalapeno straws were completely out of place on the plate.  I probably left half of my food behind; I could have done better at home.    One of my friends ordered a wrap he seemed to enjoy; the other ordered the special - they serve prime rib Saturday evenings.  She found it under-done but it looked right to me.  For some reason we thought we might need an order of the mac and cheese.  Friends; if your mother ever made you mac and cheese; this will be a disappointment.    My glass of wine was empty for; I don't know; a good half an hour.  The server never noticed.    The facilities in the handicap bathroom I realize must have been built to code but anyone paying attention will notice that the soap dispenser; mirror; and towel dispenser are unsuitably high for someone sitting in a wheelchair.    I wish Market Grill all the best; someone has put a lot of love into the building and is trying to make it as an entrepreneur; and I appreciate that.  But they need some serious focus and refinement on the menu concept and design and a reboot on the service. [REVIEW_22] Worst service ever. Ordered appetizers and meal and it took forever.  Look out if you want a drink refill because you might be able to drive home and come back and the drink might not be on the table.  Normally; getting food to take a while wouldn't bother  me but the restaurant was not even half full. [REVIEW_23] Wish I would have came on Yelp and read the previous reviews; it would've saved me a lot of time and frustration. I ran in today to see if someone could take a look at my right passenger front wheel. My tire pressure light was on and I noticed a piece of tire was lifted. I go in and he tells me it's a couple hours wait. Ok; I'll give you that I just showed up so the wait thing is to be expected. I ask the guy if I can make an appointment to come back. He says its first come first serve. Really? When I've made appts previously with other Just Tires? Why not just say you don't want my service? Bottom line? Guy was rude and lacked any customer service. Went down the street to Mr. Tire and was in and out with a replaced new tire in half an hour. Oh; and they appeared WAY busier based on the waiting area and cars in the garage. [REVIEW_24] This is hands down the WORST nail salon I have ever been to. It's highly overpriced and my manicure was awful. They filed off my gels instead of scraping; but they weren't careful and they also filed off my skin. I had three bloody fingers on each hand. My nails were uneven-some really thick; some thin; some with bubbles. The gel started peeling off after less than a week. I should have read the reviews before I went!! You are better off doing your nails yourself. [REVIEW_25] Never coming back. This is the second we've given then. Tonight; they charged us an extra $5; but was easily correct; not a huge deal. Second; the onion rings tasted like vanilla! We ordered a brownie cookie dough blast and got a cookie dough shake instead; the difference of about a dollar. My shake was missing the middle portion(see photo). The only good thing about this trip was the mozzarella sticks. 2 shakes and 2 sides for $15; no thanks. [REVIEW_26] I called to get a price on getting a flat fixed $35.99WTH! Is this price legal... Smdh in a city where they don't EVEN pay livable wages.... #tragic ..smdh [REVIEW_27] This has been an awful experience. We walked in around 1:30 pm and we waited for our drinks for 40 minutes and had to remind the waiter three times. Half of our table received their meals while the other half had to wait an extra 20 minutes. There were two tables here and a few at the bar; not busy at all. The table behind us walked out due to the awful service; and I'm currently wondering why I didn't. never going back [REVIEW_28] Wow new ownership and they don't care about customers that's for sure.dont go here for lunch or if you are in a hurry. I think this location won't last long with the attitude they have here ... [REVIEW_29] I'm from out of town and picked up an awful sinus infection. I neeeeeded hot and sour soup. I got broth with some vegetables and about 2 ounces of corse ground pepper. It was awful. I ordered for my son and husband and their food was awful. The crab Rangoon was burnt.  Three entrees; 1 pint hot and sour soup and one order crab Rangoon. It was almost 60 bucks for tiny boxes of food. [REVIEW_30] After a 90-min wait (we were told it would be an hour); I went for dinner with my sisters. The food was just okay and over-priced. The polenta wasn't the best I've had; the cheese empanadas were not empanadas but rather fried little puff balls (and if they're going to be vegetarian; there should more more; not less of the meat ones); the cauliflower was pretty good but again; not worth the price.   But let me tell you about our service! First the server brought out the wrong wine for my sisters (they got a red cab Mendoza; a white Chardonnay was delivered). Nobody really checked on us except to ask if we wanted to order more food. Then! One of my sisters PULLED A REALLY LONG HAIR OUT OF HER MOUTH AFTER TAKING A BITE OF FOOD!!!!!!!! When we alerted our server; his response was; ""ew; I'll be sure to tell the chef.""  NEVER did we get an apology; nor was the item replaced nor taken off the check!!!!! And on top of that; he charged us for the red AND the white wine!!!!! The sister who had the hair is super polite and it was impressive that she even alerted him of the hair; so unfortunately she did not fight to have the item taken off; regardless of my urging her to do so. Alas; I decided to share this review. That hair was LONG AND NASTY!   No way will I return. What a shame.",8
51,"[REVIEW_1] Great location; close to all the ""tourist-y"" stuff.  Hotel is beautiful!  You can walk to everything including the Arch and Busch Stadium.  Close to dining.  Felt safe there and the staff was excellent!! [REVIEW_2] It was after July 23 that our ceilings were finally fixed. The maintenance man was very nice; did seem sincere. Stated they needed to hire an outside company to fix it.   Today a valet trash can with diapers and tampons shows up.... The apartment next to me is empty. Perfect timing too; a neighbor left a box with dinner plates today for me and they've gone missing. She meets me outside as I pull up from work and gets to see the trashcan ""of goodies"". Newer neighbor too. No one has called me to apologize for the deplorable conditions. Not even offer an amount off of our rent; Anything at all.   Message me and I will answer any questions based on my experience here.   Also of note; the responses that say that Sheqoia the regional manager will talk to me.... She still hasn't called. There is no value to any resident here from management.  8/7/2015. Still have not talked to tabitha. [REVIEW_3] The breakfast menu and pastry menu changes so some visits I have liked more than others; but I love the way they do there menu; the overall quality is top notch. The food is funky and creative. I would not say its an every weekend brunch spot with the old reliable eggs florentine​/pancakes but it is fun and I love coming here from time to time. Beware the line can get long but they have very good coffee and pastries​ to hold you over while you wait.  p.s. The restaurant​ vibes are great! [REVIEW_4] I love this restaurant and eat there at least once per week. I try to get something new every time I go but every time I try something new I love it so much I want it again. The general manager Shannon is very accommodating. I usually eat at the bar and the bar staff is very friendly and will go out of their way to make you feel welcome. Today I had the blackened  redfish etouffee which was awesome.  The crème brûlée is pretty good too. There's a great happy hour in the bar from 3 PM until 7 PM weekdays; and from 11 AM to 3 PM on weekends. You really can't beat that. [REVIEW_5] We spent about 3 hours here today with our 14 month old grandson. He had a blast! There are plenty of picnic tables and shady areas. All the children were mindful of him as he ran around in the water play area. It was pretty busy but it's spaced out so well that we never felt like we were in the crowd.  He also loved walking out on the pier.  We live in  Sarasota and I wish we had a park this beautiful. We will go back. [REVIEW_6] I was just there last night. Awesome Italian restaurant. You are welcomed by the owner when you walk in who is very friendly and wants to ensure you are enjoying the meal and service. I can tell that the customer is extremely important to her and it shows as there is a decent wait; but it is worth it. This is my go to place for Italian food. Prices are reasonable and the plates plentiful. I typically get penne vodka with chicken. Their penne vodka sauce is second to none. What separates them from others is the apps are great; filling and just as much detail goes in the creation as their main dishes. Combine all this with BYOB and you can't go wrong. I never have room for dessert; maybe one day. If you want a consistent; reliable Italian restaurant this is it. [REVIEW_7] Though I'm personally not a huge Bud (or domestic beer for that matter) fan; there's not a lot you can complain about a free informative tour and free beer! And not just any 'ol bud but a variety of specialty beers that you can't find anywhere else. The clydesdales and dalmatians are the best part of the tour! Be sure to stop by their impressive gift shop to pick up some souvenirs.  Bottom line; when in Rome; do as the Roman's do; so when in St. Louis; make a stop off at Anheuser-Busch brewery and grab a bud like a good midwesterner ;) [REVIEW_8] Stopped by on my way out of Nashville for a quick bite. Mistake. As soon as I walked in the manager made an offensive comment about my appearance (I have long hair and a beard so she referred to me as ""baby Jesus"") Not a good start.  Food quality was very poor even for a buffet; and the stock was extremely low on everything; and what was there was cold and unpleasant. Drinks never were refilled.   I tried to salt my food and discovered not one; but all salt shakers were caked with water and unfunctional. When I asked the server for fresh salt she proceeded to check the tables and came back several minutes later with what she claimed was ""the best she could find"" rather than making a fresh bottle; and it was just as caked as the others.   If I had to say one positive thing about it; I'd say that I'm 90% positive that the steak was made from actual beef!   Do yourself a favor and never go here. [REVIEW_9] This is a gigantic restaurant with ample seating and a nice ambience.   Beverages: This is the perfect place for cocktails; coffee and  cider. There is a wide variety of drink selections; and the cinnamon and caramel apple cider drinks are wonderful additions to the fall menu   Starters: The New Orleans BBQ shrimp is quite tasty but by far my favorite thing to do is order the pomme frites with garlic mayo. These little guys are like crack; and even people who hate mayo seem to love the dipping sauce   Entrees: The curried chicken salad is fantastic; though I wish they would consider serving it on different bread (it comes on two mini sandwich rolls). The BLT is also a good choice (the addition of avocado and chipotle sauce is pretty ingenious); and the club sandwich is humongous and satisfying.   Dessert: I don't even know where to start. The Brown Shugga pie is stupid good. It never would have occurred me to order it because I don't sit around thinking about brown sugar; but a friend of mine did and I ate almost the whole thing. It's ooey; gooey; rich and delicious. The key lime pie is also a spectacular pick; as is the apple crisp. I've had almost every dessert on the menu; and not one of them has been a disappointment. The carrot cake might be one of the biggest slabs you can get in the entire United States... and it is so worth every last calorie. [REVIEW_10] My bad... I was in the Crescent City last March and took this tour and forgot to leave a review!!  I've been on quite a few walking tours in the city and this is THE BEST one I've ever taken.  It encompasses way more than the other ones offered. You won't regret taking this one as you get it all along with getting to follow the history of the Duparc-Locoul family. [REVIEW_11] We try to eat somewhere special on our last night of a trip. This was our first visit to New Orleans. We started by looking for a Landry's restaurant since we are club members. When this place popped up we made reservations.   We were seated at a table in the bar area. We requested a low top instead of a high top table on the reservation. Don't make this mistake. The high top tables are the ones beside the window that overlooks the river. Our server's name was Erica and she was an absolute delight. She made our dining experience very enjoyable.   I started with the Captain's punch which contained rum; banana; peach; and tropical juices. It was very good. The blackened redfish etouffee with creole green beans and dirty rice sounded amazing so that's what I ordered. It was delicious.   We had a great last night in NOLA with our special dinner. This will be a must on return trips. [REVIEW_12] Growing up I lived right by Donut Drive-in.  We'd go every week after church and my sister and I would fight over the sprinkle donuts or the blueberry iced donuts.  Having moved back to St. Louis recently I forgot all about this place until one day my husband said ""Wow; that place looks old"" and I said ""We'll go there some weekend"" ---it took a few weeks but finally we were in the area so I got a dozen donuts for breakfast--HEAVEN!  I went in and picked out the donuts and it was like my entire youth flooding back--they haven't changed a bit which is comforting and also it makes sense--if it ain't broke; don't fix it!  My personal favorite is the french cruller with chocolate icing.  Tastes just like I remember although the custard with powdered sugar is a close second.    It was packed when I went inside but it took no time at all to get my box o' donuts.  Donut drive-in; don't ever change! [REVIEW_13] The food is very good; especially for the price. It's nicely flavored and healthier than most other places for the price. The service is amazing as well; as the two ladies who run the restaurant are extremely personable. [REVIEW_14] We found this hotel on hotel tonight for a total of 123 a night. We had previously stayed at the Castillo Inn at the beach the night before and had a not so great experience; check out my review for that! Anywhoo; the price was cheap for the night of; I would recommend the app to anyone! Great is you want to not be on a schedule or are feeling a little spontaneous. The room was comfy; so was the bed. We wanted a low key night so we walked around the corner to the brew house which is a local bar around the corner and recommended by one of our tour guides. We even rented a movie; free of charge; from the front desk. They had great bathroom products and an excellent brunch in the morning! We will definitely make this our go-to hotel in SB! [REVIEW_15] Joe and his son installed three garage doors on our new construction. They were organized; efficient and friendly. We are very happy with the quality; look and style of our new garage doors. [REVIEW_16] The best comedy club in Santa Barbara. Okay the only club. But still a great club to come watch a show. Don Friesen was the headliner the day we went and I have seen him several times before at various clubs but never gets old. Super talented and super funny and super impressive since Don is. Totally clean comedian. He has actually won the San Francisco comedy festival twice -the only person to ever have done that with two different hours of material. No I don't work for Don but he always impresses me. The acts from start to finish were terrific. And the food is great which says something bc a lot of comedy clubs just do crappy bar food: i had ahi and oysters which I was hesitating about but had no reason to. The food was greatl. The comedy was great.the staff was great. Run don't walk here. [REVIEW_17] I've tried many sweet treats here; and it's ALL very good. This bakery has the taste to be world renown.  I hope to see more locations; but whatever magic they work in this shop; im just happy i can get to it. It's that good. [REVIEW_18] Simply put there is only one thing I care about when it comes to chiropractors; how do I feel after going and how do I feel days after going etc.  I just started going here and the answer is I feel significantly better; and it lasts longer after each visit which is what I expect.  Another good thing is they will not try and get you to come in 3 times per week like some Chiros; which is something I do appreciate. [REVIEW_19] First time I went to Earl's new American kitchen I liked the food it was good wasn't great but it was a ok   service not so great sat at the bar did not really care for a bartender tried it again second time bartender was really rude I would never go back there  or Recommend it to anyone [REVIEW_20] What's the point of setting a pick up time for a ToGo order when you end up waiting 30mins after that to get your food anyway?? The restaurant wasn't busy in the slightest; and it literally took over 30 minutes from the time I was supposed to pick up my order for them to actually bring out my to go order. I could've walked in and ordered food; and I would've gotten it faster. [REVIEW_21] This gym inspires me to workout. The gym is so bright and spacious and lots of equipment for all. The Staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Best of all they keep this gym clean at all times. [REVIEW_22] We've been hearing of a new menu in the works for months since the much-ballyhooed original chef who developed the current one apparently didn't work out. The current kitchen staff executes the current menu rather badly. Chipotle shrimp tacos were bland and missing ingredients promised on the menu. At breakfast at least the waiter (one he showed up at breakfast) was honest in admitting that the salmon was no longer house-smoked as the menu says. Respect your customers enough not to lie to them on an easily corrected paper menu. Corned beef hash was more like chili; swimming in a sea of greasy broth in a bowl. Will give it one more strike if they get around to a new menu before improving. [REVIEW_23] Worst experience ever!!!!   I stood in line today for 1 hour and 20 minutes for 1 shot. They the walked up in front of me and closed the line. Told me they were done and leaving. There were 60 people behind me outraged as well. F*** this place [REVIEW_24] Stopped by for lunch (AGAIN).  I would have gone to a New England tradition; the lobster roll; but felt a little adventurous;  and went for the lobster wrap with pico de gallo & a spicy mayo.  Can I say; YUM!  The lobster had a touch of lemon that really helped bring out the flavor; & it was nice and chunky... not overdressed.  It was served in a standard flour tortilla with kettle chips and a vinegar touched cold slaw.  If I were you; I wouldn't wait until you were in the area to stop by.  It's worth the trip & you can bring home a few live lobsters to boot! [REVIEW_25] My dad and I just happened upon this place one Saturday night and decided to give it a go.   You have to knock on the door to be let in; and the inside is gorgeous. Dimly lit; the walls are lined with tapestries. You sit on cushions; and eat an entire seven course meal with your hands (after they have been washed in rose water). Great food and the house wine is really good (and inexpensive). You almost feel as if you were invited into someone's home. A belly dancer even came out in the middle of our meal!   We went pretty early on a Saturday night; so the fact that we didn't have a reservation wasn't a problem. We went about 5-5:30 and it was completely empty; but it started to really fill up around 7; so if you are going later make a reservation.  The only problem we ran into is that they don't take credit cards. Luckily they do take checks. This place has it all - atmosphere; great food; and good service! Big points for overall experience! [REVIEW_26] Delicious and great service. We had six items on the menu including dessert and each item was melt in your mouth delicious. [REVIEW_27] Last Monday I jogged up the stairs out of the 19th and Market green line station and was basically punched in the face by the amazing smells coming from this food truck more than a block away. I'd eaten at the Falafel truck before so as soon as the incredible aromas of grilled marinated chicken hit my nose I knew what I was going to be chowing down on that day.  The food at this truck is amazing. While the meal varies quite a bit from day today; there are a few things you can generally count on: a portion of delicious hummus; some really good falafel; a pita or roll; a generous helping of some of the best grilled; marinated chicken that I've ever tasted; and two other items. One of the two is usually some sort of risotto or pasta in sauce (which is always good). The other is often a sauce or fruit item.   Recently; the chef has also been handing out cups of soup to people as they wait in line (different soups every day) and a bottle of Perrier with the meal. He does not list a price but generally charges $10; which is well worth it for an enormous and tasty meal that should last all day.   It's also worth noting that the comments about the guy who runs this truck are not exaggerated. He is a real character and likes to go on and on about how high quality his food is; how difficult it is to get quality ingredients; etc. He wants to know if you like quality food and if you are willing to pay for quality. Quality quality quality. Quality. At first I found this a little off-putting but now I find it an endearing feature of the experience. He clearly cares a lot about what he does and as long as you don't take the conversation too seriously it'll be fine.    My one MAJOR caveat for this place is do NOT try to eat here if you are very particular about your food. He gives you what he gives you and isn't going to be making anything specific to your tastes. It's also very hard to predict how spicy his food will be -- usually it's relatively mild but occasionally it can get quite hot. I wouldn't count on being able to get a description before getting served; so only venture here if you are fairly flexible about the flavor profile of what you are getting. I also might suggest shying away if you have food allergies.   That said; if you can get past this you are in for a really flavorful meal at a good value! [REVIEW_28] Completely unprofessional and pathetic. I called last week to get price quotes on a battery and brakes. I spoke to someone very nice- he gave me two quotes; fairly low but close to other shops. I call today to schedule a time to come in and the prick who answers the phone; his name is either Mike or Nick (and quite frankly I don't care what he's called); tells me there is no battery even close to that price. He ""blames"" the quote on me; saying ""I don't know how you came up with that price?"" Then I told him I'd like to speak to someone else and he says ""no; we won't do a battery for that price; so bye-bye"" and he HUNG up the phone. NEVER NEVER call these people. I can go to Walmart before I deal with these assholes. [REVIEW_29] Absolutely the worst meal I've had in a very long time. Everything was super greasy; salad was old and wilted and I spent more time picking out the rotten pieces of lettuce than I did attempting to eat it. The ranch dressing; honey mustard and ""roadhouse"" dipping sauce were all disgusting. The fries and chicken tenders were not only greasy but looked and tasted like someone's leftover lunch from yesterday that they over cooked in a microwave.  Again; worst meal ever! [REVIEW_30] I went there once years ago I believe I cut my order down when the employee went from picking up trash to picking up my bagels No glove; not even paper.. I don;t recall all the details; but my immediate thought was it's another establishment that has no concept of hygiene and exploits the lack of oversight..To top it off; the bagels were far from fresh Needless to say; I haven't been back But I realize many people don't care about cleanliness. If that's you; you'll enjoy this place.",21
52,[REVIEW_1] Probably the best White Russian I've ever had in my life and it was only $5.50.  Staff was super friendly and the location was conveniently close to the crazy bar scene; but also hidden in a little nook of chill and recharge [REVIEW_2] Our first time here and it was excellent.  Very fresh ingredients and flavorful.  We had two different soups; chicken satay and pad Thai with amazing mango sticky rice for dessert.  We look forward to many return trips here. [REVIEW_3] The last 2 times we took our dog here; our female dog got kennel cough.  Added vet bills over $100.  Never going back to this place again. [REVIEW_4] Great service. My husband ordered a cheese and bacon burger and I got the crawfish sausage por bo both well made and great tasting. [REVIEW_5] I get something different every time and it's always great! The prices don't bother me ( or paying for rice-which is loaded w vegetables and spices ) because I don't go here for cheap food. Always fresh and fast! The servers are nice and quick. I love the atmosphere as well. [REVIEW_6] YUM YUM that's for sure; great place for an awesome sub. Potato salad along with the macaroni salad is also very good. I can't believe I've never been to or heard of it before. Staff is awesome; great place that we keep going back to now. [REVIEW_7] This was a great tour if the factory and it's free.  It takes about one hour and is very neat. After the tour they give  you a few beers.  Free Beer is always good. [REVIEW_8] First visit to this new salad & pizza joint. Design your own or select from menu for either or both signature items. Ingredients are very fresh and available in a broad range of choices. I particularly liked the standard thin pizza crust which is made fresh daily on-site. My Greek salad was excellent. Bread sticks are very good. My mother-in-law enjoyed the salad with chicken; cukes; banana peppers and cheese that she created. Service was efficient and workers were knowledgeable and pleasant. I'll be back for an encore experience. [REVIEW_9] We had such a great time. Pat; the owner; reserved a couple bikes for us on Labor Day weekend and off we went! Cruised the harbor and up the hill to the park with very little effort. Stopped off for lunch and we had zero stress because Pat supplied a bike lock. Went into the Funk Zone and some wine tasting. While everyone else was on foot...we were able to cover major ground and we breezed through traffic. Recommend highly and we will do it again as we visit here often. We had a lot of fun. [REVIEW_10] Instagram worthy and Claire is an amazing server!   Suraya is super beautiful guys. Nice open space; ceramic tiles; and orange infused water. You enter straight into their bakery/cafe where you can order and sit or you can walk past a little and be seated in their restaurant. I recommend making a reservation because it can get pretty crowded. After a 10 min wait my party of 4 were seated straight away. Their booths are super comfy and bouncy!   Claire came to us shortly after and was super knowledgeable about the menu and helped us navigate for one of our party members who has an allergy. I started with the chai tea latte- so delicious. Then got a kefta platter. Once the food came out I realized it was the kefta sandwich but Claire and the manager figured everything out straight away and fixed my order (thanks guys!). The kefta was super moist; the hummus was A1 and their fries were seasoned to the max. Though I think their tabouli could have more lemon- just my preference though. Afterwards I finished with a rose and pistachio cruller which was so light and airy. Y'all gotta try it.   If visiting philly again I would definitely come back to Suraya. [REVIEW_11] Solid egg and bacon breakfast with the home fries being a stand out.  Had a tasty orange/carrot/apple juice to accompany it.  Best part is probably the location in the charming Lower Garden District neighborhood. [REVIEW_12] Fast; responsive and pleasant staff.  Requested price late at night and had them by for service the next afternoon. Thank you! [REVIEW_13] I pretty much never write a review but I have been using this Panera for almost two years now. Not consistently but a couple times a month and the staff/service is always excellent. Everything is always fresh and my order is correct. They do a great job making a large company feel like a mom and pop shop. Not to mention Panera has the absolutely best bagels ever. [REVIEW_14] It simply does not get any better than Tako for sushi. Everything is fresh & delicious. The private rooms are so fun for a festive night out; it's BYO & when my girls get together we enjoy the feast & atmosphere! Some personal favorites are the jalapeño yellowtail(a must!!); kani salad; bird's nest roll & the naruto (served in cucumber instead of rice. Honestly; you can't go wrong when ordering. And so reasonable!! I rarely spend over $35 including tip when we go; and we do not hold back at all when ordering. Highly; highly recommend Tako! [REVIEW_15] the foods great; but no buflight on tap.i love the servers there ; especially Jamie White; whose the best server. But again. Lack of Bud light is a big negative [REVIEW_16] Haven't had Thai food this good; this cheap; and this bountiful in a long time. Small but cozy shop and I love the Polaroids they have on the wall with customer reviews! I had the pangang curry with chicken for $10 (comes with white rice). Got full on about half of it; took the rest home and had it for lunch the following day. The food is served to you in to-go style Tupperware so it's perfect for leftovers. Can't wait to visit this restaurant again and try their lunch bentos! [REVIEW_17] I will never patronize King ribs on Georgetown Rd ever again. What is the point of calling in an order only to arrive 30 minutes later to be told that the order was never placed. Second time this has happened. They lied. I will never go back. [REVIEW_18] Unless you planned on being robbed of thousands go somewhere else.  I've had continuous problems w a power steering on my impala for going on 2 years. 1st time they cldnt fix it right and went back and paid them double to re-do the job. In the process after I got my car back I noticed my hood looked funny. They broke a connector piece that holds the bumper to the frame. They refused to fix it. Power steering bad again after a second time. I attempted to sue but I wrongfully filed in greenfield when I sld of in marion.  I'm young didn't know that. All my parts and service is under warranty. So point blank they're still responsible for my car. Took it back up and they Rudely refused to do any work on my car cuz I did try and sue them. So I literally spent around $4k just for nothing.  These ppl lied to me over and over.  And they obviously don't know how to do any work. I was personally told not to go here because they would charge too much. I understood that but I  figured I'd rather go here than a old beat up service place. I figured I cld trust a dealership.  I figured I cld get the job done right.  I was wrong. I hope no 1 has to deal w what I have.  You need and service done to your vehicle I'd strongly suggest you take you business somewhere else. Or you'll be sorry.  I find it funny when I'm told we couldn't come to an agreement.  I was point blank told  #1 no we're not fixing it again. Even though it is under warranty.  #2 no your not getting your money back. [REVIEW_19] Took husband to Maynard's on a spontaneous birthday dinner trip. Ended up ordering off of the happy hour menu. Steak tartare; mussels; and poutine. Each was $7 and more than enough for two people. Excellent food quality; excellent service! Will come back to try more of their happy hour menu!!! [REVIEW_20] Fantastic service from Jo Jo! Recommended through my insurance company there is a reason why they prefer this excellent vendor. Jo called to ask if he could show up EARLY which was great as it freed up my day. Work was performed perfectly and in record time. I hope if I need another windshield that Jo Jo shows up! Thanks Safellite! [REVIEW_21] This place is game changer for the neighborhood. We got some take out tonight and the food was absolutely  delicious.  I'm really stoked they moved in and I'm newly smitted by southern Latin food.  The family who owns it also seem very sweet!  I think this place is exactly  what the neighborhood needed! [REVIEW_22] Best brunch in town! Their drinks and pastries are amazing. Their sweet potato hash is my favorite breakfast option! [REVIEW_23] Absolutely stress free car buying experience at Montgomeryville Acura. I was in and out with my pre-owned car in about an hour. My rep Thomas Massi was knowledgeable; experienced; and helpful throughout the process. The car was priced lower than KBB and I got exactly what I expected without the stress. Would definitely recommend! [REVIEW_24] My husband; my 2 1/2 year old son and I really enjoyed our visit. Although it was a little over crowded we still had fun. Very clean place. Only thing I can complain about is it is a little pricey to eat here. [REVIEW_25] Great job first day open packed but well organized me and my family will be back multiple times a week. Thanks for coming to reno. [REVIEW_26] I got the Boulder Shake Chocolate Porter-- it was great! This place had a really nice vibe. Super relaxing and laid back. A great place to go to with my girlfriends. I wish I had tried the food at the cafe though; it looked (and smelled) amazing. [REVIEW_27] Just left there...horrible service and miserable employees.  WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN. Miss Baja fresh. [REVIEW_28] I've eaten here 4 times and have enjoyed it for the most part. But last night was terrible. The pork tasted like leather; the $17 shrimp curry came with 3 shrimp  and the cashew chicken had almost no chicken. Very; very disappointed. I won't be going back anytime soon. [REVIEW_29] My son got a pho and thought it was ok. My daughter got the tofu pad Thai and she said it was horrible. It tasted very bland; with almost no flavor; also; it was super spicy!! All in all; we didn't really like the food here. [REVIEW_30] Delicious; low price; and less rice! Amazing rolls; wide variety and very cheap for all you can eat for lunch; $15.99; can't beat that deal. They use less rice for each roll so you don't get full as fast and are not forced to break the roll in 2. Highly recommended.,23
53,"[REVIEW_1] Wow! Great new addition to Broadway. The venue is amazing. Ate at the rooftop Lookout. Ordered almost half the menu between the five of us. Love the small plate concept; got to try and share so much. Cocktails are fabulous. Prices are extremely reasonable; especially for the quality. Service is spot on. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. [REVIEW_2] Horrible service. Sat there for 20 minutes before server finally came out. Claims no one told her we were there. Guess she couldn't see us. Had to get something quick because we had tickets to the playhouse theater. Got to the restaurant with more than an hour to spare. She took our order and said she would be back with our bread. She never came back. Another 30 minutes passed; so we decided to leave. Just as we were leaving our food showed up. They couldn't believe we were leaving.  Felt good to stick it to them for a 55 minute wait. Luckily the playhouse is a short distance away. [REVIEW_3] Stood in line and were ignored. The host proceeded to seat his friends who were clearly standing behind us before asking if we had been helped. [REVIEW_4] From the looks of it; Helzberg really don't care much about the social media comments and their customer's satisfaction. Today my wife and I just came out of Macy's cancel one of the ring I bought her for Valentine's Day due to wrong size. I already knew their services have gone to the gutter in recent years; its worse than going to a car dealership; where you get judged by their superficial eyes. If they don't think you are going to buy; they don't want to waste a second on you. So I told the first lady who greet us straight up; I was looking for a diamond ring around $800; I showed her the picture of the ring we cancelled at Macy's; all I asked is something comparable in price for a gold diamond ring. She showed me one right away but the diamond was a lot smaller than what we were looking for.  But she was able to find another one; not perfect; but at least my wife liked. I asked her what is the best price she can give us; after some negotiation; she said there is a $150 discount; and because we were still unsure (the diamond was still a lot smaller than the one in Macy's for similar price); she said she would throw in resizing service for free. It was already around noon time; both of us were hungry and I didn't want to rush a decision like this; so I told her we will think over lunch and be back if we decides.   So later that evening; I got the chance to go out alone; so I went back to the store to make the purchase. Right away I made the mistake telling the ladies that are working there I was there earlier; talked to a tall older lady; and I'm ready to make the purchase. At the time there were three of them; one was busy with the customer; one was on the phone; then there is a lady completely free. But you can tell right away she does not want to help me since I was already here before; even she get some commission it will not be the whole commission. So she told me go talk to the lady on the phone... Then the lady on the phone doesn't seem to have any interest helping me either; kind of yelling across from the store to the other ""free"" lady something I didn't even pay attention. So I'm standing in the middle of them feeling unwanted by those two. Finally the first free lady ask me whats my name blah blah... after wasted few more minutes she finally asked me which ring. So I pointed to the ring and told her what price was promised me earlier. Again she asked my name (for what reason I don't know); then she asked me if I had the other lady's card (I wasn't very happy with the first lady's service to begin with; she often answered my question in a snobbish way as if we couldn't afford the more expensive ring like ""oh that's $3000...."" in a condescending tone. So even when I told her we will think over lunch she didn't bother to give me her card.    By now; the evening lady was trying to hint to the other lady I had no reference maybe she should just sell to me like a regular sale. The other lady obviously doesn't want her to get the complete commission (also it is breaking the industry rule). While all of them keep having the tone I was just making up the price which I was promised from the morning lady! So I said maybe you should call her up; most sales people who care about their commission wouldn't mind the phone call.  At first the evening lady doesn't seem want to (too much work to make a call you know); finally the other lady also suggest she should call. So she went to the back room for roughly 5 to 10 minutes (don't know why she couldn't just call right front of me; the phone is right there!)  She comes back and told me there are not even a $150 discount (even though there is advertisement for $50 off on $299 purchase; and we always get their catelog in the mail; usually is $50 for every x amount of purchase; the ring originally is $900; which made sense when the morning lady quoted $150 discount). On top of that; there is a free $300 speaker promotion going on for anything over $600; and the morning lady said I can chose $150 discount or the $300 speaker.   Anyway; my point of writing this review isn't even about not getting the originally quoted price; I sincerely hope who ever runs Helzberg Diamonds's marketing; online marketing; social media marketing or even if just the store manager who actually care about his or her store image; can take a look at their staff. The culture they are building has changed so much since we bought our wedding band over 10 years ago. I read few other people's review; they shared the similar feeling. Their staff are just bunch of vulchers.  I worked a commission job throughout my college years; I don't know what happened in recent years. these people on commission doesn't understand how to treat their customers; and just expect the customers pay their paycheck. This mindset became very sickening to the society! And they only pride on Mr Warren Buffeft's name but not his vision! [REVIEW_5] Excellent quality sushi. The sashimi and nigiri are fresh and generous in size.  Top notch sushi with limited roll options. A must go to place if you are a true sushi lover [REVIEW_6] Please; this place makes a semi-new menu and raised their prices. The food is very mediocre. i just started cooking and i make a couple pasta dishes which include spaghetti and lemon chicken piccatta.  As a beginner in cooking I can judge this place's food is horrible. A day after the food looked like it had been out for weeks. Good food can last for a day or two.When i went in there to eat the hostess was nice. first; we ordered a glass a wine. he poured the wine; missed the glass and some spilled on the table and he just ignored it. hello. idiot. waitressing 101. go back. well needless to say. not worth your money at all. ive been there during happy hour with girlfriends and its fine. not a 'high end' restaurant by any means even though they try to make it that way. [REVIEW_7] 3 calls to say when they'd come never happened. Our ""Guaranteed morning appointment"" became ""we'll try to get there in the morning"". Nobody can reach the installers; no management is available on the weekends; ""printing problems have delayed the ability to call customers back"" (actual quote); being told to wait 10 hours on a Saturday isn't convenient; something they touted in their sales process. Salesman **Name Redacted** thank you for ""not being able to do anything"" but being happy to sell the carpet.  (message me if you'd like the salesman's name)  Morning appointment; its 2:21PM currently; no carpet. [REVIEW_8] Let me be the first to say this place is no better than the crappy reviews for the previous Radisaon Hotel that occupied this spot. Service: slow; crappy. Bathrooms: I found it amusing they went to the trouble to decoratively fold the toilet paper like a flag at Arlington; when they didn't even stock soap (had to go to front desk for that). We thought Theresa sucked; then realized it's because they were sleep number beds that you could not inflate. Front desk lady didn't even understand that there was no apparatus to inflate it. When the maintenance guy came-with hands so dirty; looked like he just crawled out of a messy turbine- he had to handle the sheets to access the air plug with the one inflating machine. Evidently; he didn't get one of the mattresses plugged back up; because it slowly deflated over night. What an absolute crap hole. We had seen online that it was recently renovated- hahaha. Maybe they have just started; but; I don't think so.  They need to replace the mattresses or get the adjusters for the sleep number back. Just to be at a base level. Never again for this gal! [REVIEW_9] Terrible place with an even worse owner!!! As a former veteran I was deeply offended when my wife and I over heard the owner saying some horrible things about veterans. It took every ounce of energy for me not to lose my temper!! But we left instead to go across the street to much better bar in Bruno's. To sum it all up; he does not appreciate veterans in his bar; so we are happy to help him out with that!! What a piece of work!!! [REVIEW_10] My experience with this particular store was... *sigh; eye roll* I felt uncomfortable from the time I left my car to checking out. I was stared at the entire time; maybe I was turning colors going from aisle to aisle; idk lmaooo. However; I retrieved the item I came for. The cashier at self-checkout was nice; though. And would you know; she spoke; too! lol. It takes one positive moment to outweigh every other trivial thing.   Thank God there are way more locations with great customer service and better stocked stores. And girl; my Amex will go where I'm accepted and celebrated...OK?! So; don't worry. The revolution won't be televised in the frozen fruit section. I'm good. I won't be back.  BUT: this is was Oakville. I acknowledged where I was; and I know what it is. [REVIEW_11] YUM YUM that's for sure; great place for an awesome sub. Potato salad along with the macaroni salad is also very good. I can't believe I've never been to or heard of it before. Staff is awesome; great place that we keep going back to now. [REVIEW_12] McKenna makes my puppy look beautiful!  My first experience with a pet boarding facility was a few years back on another location; when we decided for the first time (and only time in 11 years) to take a vacation without our dog.  My parents were out of town and could not babysit; so we did the boarding thing;  After that experience; I vowed never to board my dog again; and it had nothing to do with the boarding facility.  The facility was awesome!  I paid for a private ""suite"" that had a TV tuned to Animal Planet (I am not kidding) and had a webcam so I could check up on my baby over the web.  Well; after spending most of my vacation glued to a computer screen hoping to catch glimpses of my dog doing stuff; I decided he was coming with me on every vacation from that point on.    When they opened up a Preppy Pets near my house; i was intrigued by the suite and webcam options and we decided to check them out.  Their place is top notch; and if for whatever reason I couldn't take my dog with me; this would be the only place I'd even consider leaving him.  They also have outstanding grooming services.   McKenna is their groomer; and she has magical hands.  She makes my baby beautiful every single time!   We used to have our dog groomed at Fluffy Puppies but switched to Preppy Pets as there was a certain procedure that we needed done each grooming that Fluffy Puppies wouldn't do.  It has something to do with the anal glands; and I'll leave it at that. :)  I'm a stickler for where my dog hangs out; and in his old age on what he eats; what he wears; and what he plays with.  Preppy Pets helps me keep this promise and they are as good as it gets! [REVIEW_13] Ordered food came super fast! But when we ordered dessert that's when it took 20 mins.  When the dessert came to the table my gf asks me is this supposed to have tomatoes I say no. She is about to eat her second bite and I tell her to stop. I find a piece of paper inside the bread pudding.  I ask for the manager and he comes over I inform him of these extra items. He offers me another bread pudding.... I decline. The waitress offered to refund my money for the dessert... [REVIEW_14] Ewww!!! I used to go to this location all the time; the staff was always friendly and I could count on it being good. There was also usually always an employee cleaning. However; after the experience I had today; I certainly won't be returning. The place was filthy. Food all over the window in front of where you order; food all over the floor; and food on almost every single table. I bit into my taco and thought it tasted weird; then looked and discovered that the chicken was dark meat with skin on it. Wtf happened to this place? I'm really disappointed. Please fix this store; no place where food is eaten should be this disgusting. [REVIEW_15] My husband and I came to this Bully's to watch the Nevada Wolfpack vs. Texas Tech football game on September 24th and before the 3rd quarter was over the bar replaced almost every TV with UFC. I understand the bar paid for the pay-per-view; but if they had mentioned this to us we would have sat at a location with a television bigger than the piece of crap tiny TV we are now in front of; and that was in HD; or we would have gone to a different sports bar. Plus for the second time in a row the service was horrendous.  You just lost a customer Bully's. Congratulations. [REVIEW_16] Can't speak about the food; since we never made it that far. We were seated (near the restrooms/kitchen); while a twosome that entered behind us were seated near the window and allowed to watch the comings and goings along Frenchmen Street. Was told the server would be with us soon. Server walks out from the kitchen and immediately goes to the twosome that came in after us. We were already forgotten before we had a chance to crack open the menus. Added to that; there was a dead cockroach on our table. Food didn't look spectacular enough to make us stay; that; and the dead cockroach was the ultimate deal-killer. Staff should spend more time cleaning up the joint instead of cleaning those fancy fedoras. [REVIEW_17] Rudest bartenders I've encountered. Made us wait forever for drinks while they texted. Female bartender lost my husband's card when I tried to close out our tab and told me to calm down when I explained the green card she was holding wasn't ours. she insisted she did not have my husband's card at all and continued to speak to me like I was a moron. Never going back again! [REVIEW_18] Here's an update for my further Comcast experience. Our bill was increased to 250.00 a month. We called and removed some luxery items which brought our bill to 225.00 a month. Called 4 time a to see how we could get our bill lowered; as we have been a loyal customer for 14 years. ""Nothing we can do"" was all I heard. We decided to no longer be raped by this company and set up service with Verizon. Called Comcast to cancel once we got hooked up with Verizon. All of a sudden; they can do better and reduce my bill to 140.00 a month....which I would have been extremely happy with. Unfortunately; it should have been offered the four previous times I called.  I have Verizon now and have been quite happy with the installation; customer service; and overall product.  I wish Comcast would go under because they don't care about quality customer service. They could offer me a years free of service; yet I wouldn't take it on principle. Screw you Comcast! [REVIEW_19] I posted this 2 days ago and somehow it's not showing...  Not too happy at this point.  I took my Gateway all in one to them because it wouldn't turn on. They replaced the hard drive in it. I took it home; set it up; went on FB. got off of it. Went to go on a couple of days later and it wouldn't turn again. They told me they would give me a $243 credit towards a new laptop...fine. I pick up the laptop (that not  all of my things were downloaded into properly); paid another $410.00. over $600 in total. We leave directly from there to go on vacation. At our vacation house; I want to go online and set up and play with the new computer; I couldn't get it to sign on; said the signal strength was too weak. In the mean time; on my old laptop; I'm sitting there watching television shows; my kids are signing on with their laptops; everyone's phone is getting wifi.  I take the laptop back to them; tell I want to return it ; it's lousy  First they tell me ""I can't return this; you were given multiple discounts on this"" I said no I wasn't ; I was given a credit (I paid over $600 for a laptop that costs $380 at Walmart)  Then told ""well; we can't resell this because it's used""; and that's my problem??!! Your computer dosen't work; I want to return it. I told them; look; forget the $243; I'll call that a wash; I just want back the $410 I just gave you. He ended up telling me they were going to check the computer and determine if there is a problem and let me know if they'll return my money. ......I'll keep you posted. [REVIEW_20] Dave's Dogs is a hot dog stand in a parking lot.  Nothing fancy just delicious hot dogs and a place to sit and enjoy them.   But they are not your usual hot dogs.  They are gourmet hot dogs five to choose from:  Dave's Style; Western Style; SB Style; BBQ Bacon and Pizza Dog.    I tried the Pizza Dog it was sooooo good.  A wiener topped with pepperoni; pizza sauce; cheese and Parmesan ($5.00).  The secret ingredients to ""Dave's Dogs"" hot dogs is the quick and friendly service;  cool and calm personality  and it seems great pleasure is taken to making each hot dog a masterpiece.   Overall a great atmosphere for hungry Yelpers; good times and delicious hot dogs. [REVIEW_21] Just a quick update to note that Yelp's hours for this restaurant are incorrect. CL closes between brunch/lunch and dinner. The correct hours are on the restaurant website. Yelp; please fix this! [REVIEW_22] I got some friends a room at the JW for the night as a gift the night of their wedding.  The only request I made of the front desk was that the bride and groom would not have to worry about any expenses.  2 of us separately went down and gave credit cards to the front desk to make sure everything was taken care of.  I got a phone call at 11:30 that night from the bride and groom saying that they were being asked to pay for parking.  Huge fail JW.  When I asked to talk to the manager; all he did was make excuses.  No apologies; no reassurance that they would be well taken care of for the rest of their stay.  If you want a seamless stay; this is not the place.  Huge disappointment. [REVIEW_23] I really really wanted to like this place but didn't. The chicken wasn't great and not such a wide menu to select from. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the place is cool but the food was bad. [REVIEW_24] This gym inspires me to workout. The gym is so bright and spacious and lots of equipment for all. The Staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Best of all they keep this gym clean at all times. [REVIEW_25] Nice food but don't go to this place when their busy time; such as brunch time:))    After we ordered about half hour; our food still not show up and we ask the server that we waiting long time. You know what; our server told us ""you guys only waited 22 mins."" WHat the hell is that answer supposed to be???!!!!  And we ask separate check the guy said ""we dont do separate check when we are busy."" :)) Well... i dont offer tip when you busy then:)))) Who fking cares!! [REVIEW_26] So I was starving  and craving tacos ; I walk in and nobody was there just the workers . I ordered ; paid for it and went home . Those were the worst tacos of my life; this is sad day. My stomach still hurts from the pain I felt and the disappointment. It's sad that  workers today have no pride in what they make . I love tacos so much; I will not return [REVIEW_27] Will not return. Have given this location numerous second chances for improved customer service; but have observed no positive changes. Their drive thru service is terrible; both in terms of employee attitude and communication skills as well as their seriously lacking audio technology. This location is a complete disappointment and in need of a serious management overhaul. [REVIEW_28] My husband and I went here on a Friday evening. A woman cut right in front of us as we walked up to the hostess stand and got her party of four promptly seated. We then walked up to the hostess. They had six tables open as well as people finishing their meals at several other tables. Yet they insisted they could only seat us outside (it was a torrential downpour with thunder and lightning) or at the sushi bar. When we asked about how long it would be to wait for a table they first said about 30 minutes which we agreed to (despite there being 6 open tables) yet then a moment later the manager came over and said it was not possible to wait for a table.  While I can not comment on the quality of food I can say their service is absolutely horrendous. I can not fathom why it was impossible to seat us at a table despite the 6 open tables or allow us to wait for one yet we could sit out in the storm or at the bar. I will not be returning here. [REVIEW_29] I find it hard to believe there are so many people with such low standards when it comes to the Daily Bread.  It is a ripoff of St. Louis Bread Co/Panera Bread; which in of itself I don't mind at all.  I have eaten multiple times at the Daily Bread and have yet to have an enjoyable experience.  The food is so-so at best.  Their sandwiches are basic and lack any real flavor.  I also tried the BBQ Chicken pizza and it was okay.    I certainly wouldn't steer anyone away from this place based on the food.  The food is basic and simple; not bad but also nothing great.  My biggest qualm with the Daily Bread is the service.  The majority of the workers seem utterly uninterested in helping out.  There was a line of about 6 people and one person at the register.  There was no sense of urgency to help any of the customers in line.  We waited for a good 5-6 minutes to put an order in.  After receiving our cups to get our drinks we looked for a clean place to sit and eventually settled on a table top that was the least dirty of the tables available.  There were plenty of open spots but it just appeared as though there was lots of trash left behind.  Does anyone bus these tables?  I anticipate that people are responsible for cleaning up after themselves; but it appeared as though the tables hadn't been effectively cleaned in a while.  There was also some trash on the floor that hadn't been addressed as well.  The order number was called and the order was only halfway completed.  When we asked which sandwich was ours; we were basically ignored as the girl put up two more orders.   After another few minutes the rest of the order came up and we began to eat.  I tried both items and as I stated before; both were okay.  The problem is that the food was just unable to make up for the lack of organization; the slow speed at which we were served; or the cleanliness of the restaurant.  After 3 attempts; I'm writing the Daily Bread off and won't return.  I'd rather go to St. Louis Bread Co; get the same level of food; but in a clean environment and a timely setting. [REVIEW_30] Horrible. Waited over 2 hours for our order. Called the store 3 times- kept being told it was on its way. Pizza was under done and terrible. the manager said he would refund my order. Never gave a refund. I will be going in person tomorrow for a refund.",7
54,"[REVIEW_1] Wait staff was pleasant but food took forever even though it wasn't remotely busy. Burger bun too soggy .....fries have a funky dust on them. Everything was super salty or greasy.   What is all the hype about?   Not cheap either.  Terrible.  Stay away.  Seriously.   BTW.  Two hours later and my husband and I are both feeling queasy. Thank goodness for Alka Seltzer [REVIEW_2] I am writing this based on the concert/bar only.  We went to the Eddie Money concert and chose the General Admission tickets.  The VIP seats appeared to be very well placed for viewing.  Unless you arrive at least an hour early and wait at the rail constantly; or you are well over 6 ft; you will have a hard time seeing anything.  The stage is raised above the VIP crowd nicely; but appears to be level with the G/A crowd.  This leaves over 90% of the General Admission patron with a very 'limited view'.  I am 5' 11"" and could see the band from the neck up about 60% of the time.  I would guess that men under 5' 10"" and almost every woman not in the front spent most of the show watching on a screen to the side that had the resolution of a pizza parlor. The wait staff was understaffed and less than efficient.  The security staff was just down right RUDE.  The sound was nice.  Eddie Money was great.  But in the non-VIP area; the concert layout and the service left much to be desired. It might not be fair that a concert rating affects the restaurant rating; but if you choose to have concerts in your restaurant... [REVIEW_3] Wasn't impressed by the crazy long lines and only 1 person working; took absolutely forever and was definitely not worth it. The food was terrible and so was the coffee. Definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. [REVIEW_4] 3 calls to say when they'd come never happened. Our ""Guaranteed morning appointment"" became ""we'll try to get there in the morning"". Nobody can reach the installers; no management is available on the weekends; ""printing problems have delayed the ability to call customers back"" (actual quote); being told to wait 10 hours on a Saturday isn't convenient; something they touted in their sales process. Salesman **Name Redacted** thank you for ""not being able to do anything"" but being happy to sell the carpet.  (message me if you'd like the salesman's name)  Morning appointment; its 2:21PM currently; no carpet. [REVIEW_5] Terrible service. Waited in line for an hour and finally the hostess told us they were ""suspending seating because the kitchen is backed up""; on  Saturday evening! Don't waste your time there... [REVIEW_6] Not good at all; not even for a strip mall chinese buffet.  Everything looked so old we couldn't find anything to make a positive comment about. [REVIEW_7] Total Wine & More is much; much better. I don't this this BevMo location will be open much longer. There are probably a maximum of 2 employees working here at any given time. Most of of their inventory is out of date and overpriced by a wide margin.  No wonder this place is so empty. [REVIEW_8] The food is disgusting. We watched the cook microwave all the food. Never go here. I didn't even eat the food [REVIEW_9] Worth every penny!  Had a bio lift facial with Magda and deep tissue massage with Colleen. In my opinion I could have gone with a regular facial and been amazed. The bio lift didn't do much for me. I am a convert and already have my next appt scheduled! [REVIEW_10] Really like this place..Food isn't always the star of the show; but doesnt mean its not good..It really is. Good selection of beer; wine list is simple and good. But sets a great vibe that you can tell makes it everyones neighborhood joint. Always a fun time. [REVIEW_11] This was so disappointing. I love Chick fil A. My son even works at the Avon location; which is fabulous. This is not the same. I tried to order my usual; that I get several times a week in Avon; and they received to accommodate. I only wanted the bread from the mini rolls. Go to Avon; very close and such a wonderful place to eat. [REVIEW_12] We took a trip to New Orleans for spring break/my son's 11th birthday.  One of our excursions was the Swamp Tour; our guide was Capt. Troy.    Please please please take this tour.  When I say it was awesome; that is an understatement.  Capt. Troy provided us with a wealth of information.  He was very patient and answered every question that was asked.  I am  a Swamp People (the reality show) fan and I learned stuff that was totally different than the show....oh AND we were on Honey Island; how cool is that.   If you take a trip to the Bayou make sure you book a swamp tour through Cajun Encounters; you will NOT be disappointed from beginning to end. [REVIEW_13] Went for lunch and the food on the buffet was fantastic! The onion chutney was amazing! [REVIEW_14] WORST experience EVER!!!  I called ahead twenty minutes to let the restaurant know that I needed a table for eleven people.  I was told that they didn't take reservations and that I'd have to let the hostess know when we arrived about our party size.  It was very upsetting that they couldn't accommodate this.  We arrived in twenty minutes as planned; and told the hostess we needed a table for eleven people.  The hostess dropped her jaw and shook her head and said it would be a twenty minute wait.  45 minutes later we still had no table....we asked to speak to the manager.  The managers name is carrie.  The manager was EXTREMELY rude!!!!!!!  The three hostess are very rude as well.  They couldn't even figure out to connect 3 tables together to accommodate a table of eleven.  The manager then proceeded to throw her hands in our faces; yell; say she couldn't help us and continue with dirty looks.  It's unacceptable behavior.  I would like to say that our waiter; Javier; was kind; professional; and efficient.  But I won't be back. [REVIEW_15] The pizza was horrible had to send it back.. Even though we didn't get a new one they tried charging us for it even though we literally only took a bite.. The server avoided talking to us about it and we had to get her attention and she said she will talk to the manager about it and came back making it seem like they were doing us a favor. I do not recommend this place. [REVIEW_16] We've been hearing of a new menu in the works for months since the much-ballyhooed original chef who developed the current one apparently didn't work out. The current kitchen staff executes the current menu rather badly. Chipotle shrimp tacos were bland and missing ingredients promised on the menu. At breakfast at least the waiter (one he showed up at breakfast) was honest in admitting that the salmon was no longer house-smoked as the menu says. Respect your customers enough not to lie to them on an easily corrected paper menu. Corned beef hash was more like chili; swimming in a sea of greasy broth in a bowl. Will give it one more strike if they get around to a new menu before improving. [REVIEW_17] --------DINNER REVIEW----------  I rarely write reviews; but this honestly was one of the worst group dining experiences I've ever had. It was objectively a horrible experience; even without comparing it to the hype it receives; and ruined what was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner celebration.   We had a group of 8 that had a reservation made well in advance. Short wait; but not too bad. Keep in mind; it seemed like a normal Friday night; but weren't super busy or at-capacity.  It was a birthday dinner; so I told the hostesses that it was her birthday; and asked if they could bring out something for her at the end of the meal; which was acknowledged. Pretty standard stuff; whether at a Applebee's or the French Laundry. We were sat at a booth right next to the Maitre D' stand; and next to all the wait staff's home base; so pretty much no excuse for not getting any attention.   After getting us waters; it took them a LONG time to even come by and acknowledge us. After ordering wine; it took them another good 15-20 minutes to even bring us our wine; and no one even checked in on us! (hint: if you're running a restaurant; wine is your profit center and doesn't take any work other than taking a bottle off a shelf and opening it. bring it out ASAP...).   After ordering food; it was more of the same...a long wait for food to start coming out and no one checking in on us AT ALL. We drank the bottles we ordered and had to get up and flag someone down to get another wine order. A couple of us even got up during the meal to remind them to bring out something for birthday girl at the end of the meal.   Once our meal was done and taken away; we were given dessert menus and the server disappeared for 10-15 minutes... AGAIN. After coming back; he asked what dessert we wanted; so we ordered some coffees... and waited... and waited. Eventually we got up and asked him what was going on and if they were going to bring anything out like we asked multiple times.   They finally brought out a couple of cookies with a candle...  In summary; the food was pretty hit or miss; pretty mediocre for this price point. Whipped feta; like other reviews have said; was amazing; and the Braised Lamb was really good. But the Sirloin was chewy and bland and the Grilled Caesar tasted like a soggy; luke-warm; wilted mess (two orders were left untouched by a group of 8). Atmosphere was nice and trendy. But the service; which is a huge reason to spend your hard-earned $ at a restaurant; was absolutely horrendous.   I really love going to cool; popular restaurants and having a great time; and I hate writing such a negative review; but I had to share my experience; especially for a restaurant that is getting an awful lot of (undeserved) hype. [REVIEW_18] Eyebrow tech burned my eyelids using extra hot wax. Then said oh it's that red in everyone. Really? Beware [REVIEW_19] BLAH!  Broccoli soup out of a can; the broccoli was beyond mush; my husband ordered the seafood platter; clams and shrimp were DARK brown/black and cold (cooked first while mac was boiling?) cod was two fish sticks; mac n cheese is KRAFT. He put the platter to the side of the table and told the waitress he wouldn't eat that.  Manager came over all pissed off and was downright rude.  My chicken parm was bland; burnt piece of chicken with cold bland sauce and mushy spaghetti; I ate some of it cause I felt sorry for waitress who was very good.  When we went to register the seafood platter was still on the bill so waitress went to get manager.  While we paid for drinks and my meal the manager sneered at us; very uncomfortable.   Have had bad food before but never been treated like that by any management staff; very unprofessional.    The waitress was very good for only being on the job for 4 days. [REVIEW_20] While they do have the hottest wings I've ever tried (i like everything hott hott hott); there's just too much grease for this stomach to handle..and just me..my stomach is made of iron.  My inlaws really enjoy the teri wings and eat it weekly.  Wish there was a way they could clear their arteries. [REVIEW_21] Ordered curried chicken; teriyaki; and some eggrolls with soup...I never got that order  This was my first and last time ordering food from here. Delivery was quick; I'll give them that; but the order was wrong. When I called in they said I can have a free meal on them for the mistake.  I said; okay ""I want that free meal now"" (they also offer free delivery for orders over 12.00$) my food came out to 14.87$; 18.87$ with tip.   They refused multiple times (like it'll make a difference if they bring it now or tomorrow; either way it was a lie to get me off the phone). I informed her that if she didn't send her delivery guy back I'll dispute the amount paid to them with my bank; and they'll lose a new customer.   Normally if one thing in my order was wrong I wouldn't mind at all. It's because my entire order was Wong... [REVIEW_22] I usually stay away from restaurants on piers since most are tourist traps but went to this one since it had so many good reviews. Calm chowder had good pieces of clam but the soup was pretty thick - it is ok; not as good as some reviews here claim.  Crab cakes were also ok.  The shrimp and scallops pasta was awful - small shrimps and scallops; definitely not fresh.  It was also sour; either from some wrong ingredient or some overdue sauce. [REVIEW_23] Purchased a 2015 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited over the summer.  Took it into South County Dodge to get the leather replaced on the drivers seat due to defect & they somehow managed to break the entire frame requiring me to get a rental.  Enterprise gave me a Chrystler 200 which would have been fine except the fact that it is absolutely filthy and has a giant rock chip right in the drivers line of site.  Yesterday I found out the part for my Jeep won't be in until 10/30 at which time I told them I would need a different rental due to the disgusting state of the current one.  I received a call at 7:45am today letting me know they had a Fiord Fusion for me at which time I told them I would be by on my lunch break between 11-11:15.  I got to the dealership and there was no car.  I waited for 30 additional minutes before leaving.  Not only is their fleet poorly maintained they have zero respect for anyone's time.  It's now 4:30; I still have the disgusting 200 and no one has even bothered to follow up or apologize for once again dropping the ball.  Skip the headache and go to Avis...they have never failed me. [REVIEW_24] Service sucks big time and the manager is downright nasty; but I must say their soups and coffee are good [REVIEW_25] Terrible establishment.  Poor service. The bouncers do not have any restraint. If you are female they will grab you aggressivley. ..very hostile. I have had a few terrible experiences there and I share them with everyone I meet so they know what they are getting into when they go there. Don't waste your time or your money when Nashville has so many other awesome places to offer! [REVIEW_26] Horrible experience tonight our service never checked on us. We had to ask the host for boxes; napkins drinks etc. Plus our food was cold. The ribs were burnt or over cooked. The food would have been good if it was warm. Ciara was able to give us complementary cornbread [REVIEW_27] Super excited to try this place while in town for 24 hours. We sat at the small 12 person bar and it took awhile for someone to take our drink order as there was only one bartender on a Saturday night. About 5-6 servers did say hi to us though. Drinks were fine. Apps came out which was the shrimp cocktail and meatballs. Meatballs were under cooked shrimp cocktail was fine. I ordered the chefs cut 20oz bone in ribeye with a chili rub and the wife ordered the filet with one of their toppings of cheese and peppers. The ribeye came out on a cold plate so I sent it back and the manager came over and apologized profusely. The best thing about the wife's filet was the cheese on top. She ordered it med rare and it came out slightly above rare. My steak came back out. I always order mine rare at steak houses and this was like a soggy sponge. Literally couldn't swallow more then 3 bites. The actual cut of steak was one of the worst cuts I've ever seen. The steak was bland. I had to ask multiple times what the rub was because I couldn't taste anything not even salt or pepper.  The beans that came out with the steaks were under cooked and hard. Needless to say I actually didn't eat dinner. The server came and picked up my full plate of steak and threw it away. The chefs cut was 50 bucks. And the total bill was 150 I literally spend that much at least once a week on food so that's not a big deal.  But I would rather spend 150 bucks on double quarter pounders with cheese and have to eat them all in one sitting then eat anything at this place again.  From start to finish it was horrible. [REVIEW_28] I don't understand the hubbub about burritos that are 75% rice. No wonder they call themselves ""healthy"". I wish someone would open a Baja Fresh in Tucson. Much better. [REVIEW_29] Only giving one star because I'm required to give A star in order to leave a review.   First; rude employees. We were never greeted; never acknowledged; while multiple employees came to the station in front of us and then walked away. No one even looked up at us. As we were about to walk out; someone finally stood there and looked at us. Not sure if she actually said anything; but we gave her our order anyway.   Food quality was BAD! The pinto beans were cold. The brisket was not warm; but I wouldn't call them quite cold. I looked for their health score but didn't see it posted anywhere. Maybe the lack of one should have been a sign.  Yeah; we won't be back. Like ever. With so many other restaurants in this shopping center; there are too many good choice to settle for food and service this bad. Save yourself the trouble and go next door to Panera; or Fulins; or Longhorn. Heck; even go buy you a candy bar from Target before choosing to eat here. You'll be glad you did. [REVIEW_30] Worst customer service ever; food is par by far; dirty tables; nothing like a real New York slice; I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is away from home in need of a slice of pie. I taste the time frame of some of the ingredients; Like they sat to long before being used. How could the great state of NY ever allow people who serve crappy food to use their name.",4
55,"[REVIEW_1] I am not from the area; but I do know good food when I have it and let me tell you; this was GOOD FOOD!!. Fried chicken; fried okra and squash casserole all done to perfection.  Dessert was a blackberry cobbler that was almost as good as grandma's (come on; no one beats grandma!); this was the best I have had since.  As we are staying in a hotel; we ordered food to go so that we could have it for brunch tomorrow; I am very excited to get to do it all over again!!  As to the service and the ambience; well; this is my kind of place; mismatched chairs and tables with no pretense at all. The servers are only happy if you are happy; it just doesn't get better than this! [REVIEW_2] Terrible; terrible service. Entitled hipsters who confuse orders; give attitude; and ruin customer's experience. The new manager is also frumpy and has awful music taste; think awful 50s - 80s rock/reggae music that's disappeared for a reason; but blared close to full volume. Softer; more neutral music would be greatly appreciated. Terrible consistency with orders too; they don't have consistent standards with coffee etc.  Customers are mostly Penn students; business types who interact with the school (recruiters from NYC etc) and visitors to the area. It's almost as if the staff feel some kind of insecurity or have pride issues serving almost always polite patrons.   Gelato is pretty good and coffee is pretty good but can be sloppily made (I.e mix your own iced latte). Also slimmed down portion sizes and got rid of the bar. The place has a great location and nice open feel to it; but so much potential is lost because of really shitty staff with terrible attitudes. So many frequent customers but the staff make no effort to get to know them (and trust me; they try). I can't emphasise enough how much the staff and manager need to change. [REVIEW_3] Everything here is perfect! We go to Ralph's for every special occasion. The ambience is magnificent with the dreamy oaks trees lined up on City Park for an outside view. The service is always five star.  But the food; the reason for going in the first place is what should and does stand out. Here the food is truly memorable. The short ribs appetizer alone is worth going back for again and again. Oh and the chocolate doberge cake is perfection. They have delicious special drinks each month that proceed a charity; giving you a reason to drink if you ever needed one. Ralph's is definitely a special place. [REVIEW_4] I ordered the ""special"" pasta with mushrooms and a Hef...didnt feel so good afterwards... [REVIEW_5] This place is fantastic. The food is exceptional and the service couldn't be better. Very nice and generous people with a cool atmosphere. I eat here almost every weekend. Can't beat the Cuban espresso! [REVIEW_6] Service was...wait what service?! We were disregarded for 15 minutes after asking for service. While the quality and atmosphere may have been wonderful the service was an absolute disappointment. Save your money for those that appreciate your patronage. [REVIEW_7] Heed the warnings. Long lines; poor service; HORRIBLE food. I'm sorry; but everything we were served was just nasty. We had a 3 hour layover and I neglected to look at the reviews prior to us getting a table.  We passed by several tables on our way to our seats and everyone's food looked straight nasty. But we stuck it out and went on and ordered anyway. We started with some cheese sticks. These were so gross. When they arrived on our table; they were soaked with some kind of weird brown juice. I assume it was the oil they were fried in that looked like it was last changed prior to the Exxon-Valdez oil spill back in '89. Horrible; burnt; greasy; and very ""off"" flavor. Our table mate next to us ordered the ravioli bites; they were also covered in the brown oil grease and they didn't even eat 1/2 of them.  Our pasta dishes were equally as disappointing and gross. I opted for the lasagna; and it was NASTY. The pasta itself was overcooked; which I can live with if bolstered by a decent sauce; quality/fresh meat; and good cheese. This lasagna offered NONE of these things. The sauce was the worst offender. Packed with sugar; it was a VERY SWEET; very thin red/marinara sauce. There were no spices or typical Italian seasonings; no garlic; no onion flavor; none of the deep; rich flavors that typically adorn good Italian-style food. The cheese was cheap and rubbery; and there was NO MEAT in the lasagna to speak of. Literally; I had NONE in my dish. It was absent; and sorely needed.  DO NOT EAT HERE. You WILL regret it. [REVIEW_8] This little shop is chock full of fabulocity!  Whether you're shopping for yourself; a quirky fun birthday gift or stocking stuffer; you'll find exactly what you need here - if even a good laugh.     I love that there's something in every prices range; from cute coin purses; magnets and cards; to beautiful jewelry and local artisan made gifts that I eyed for myself. They also carry Hoosier Mama Bloody Mary & Margarita mixers; which I'd been looking all over for as a gift.  My ex got I think you touched your genitals' hand sanitizer (I loved it; but I'm not sure he was equally amused).   Do yourself a favor and make a day of it in the Mass Ave. Arts district.  Be sure to allow plenty of time to take everything in at Silver in the City. I promise you won't leave empty handed. [REVIEW_9] Was thrilled with our toast being served hot. Few places manage to do that. However very uncomfortable booths. Bad parking lot. Not enough spots. So no reason to return. [REVIEW_10] Dog friendly and good selection of food and drinks. Cute outdoor patio.   We ordered the Nook Burger and Crab Cakes with slaw.  Both were delicious. I would come back again when in the area. [REVIEW_11] I usually stay away from restaurants on piers since most are tourist traps but went to this one since it had so many good reviews. Calm chowder had good pieces of clam but the soup was pretty thick - it is ok; not as good as some reviews here claim.  Crab cakes were also ok.  The shrimp and scallops pasta was awful - small shrimps and scallops; definitely not fresh.  It was also sour; either from some wrong ingredient or some overdue sauce. [REVIEW_12] We were in St Pete on the weekend and decide to eat sushi. The worst sushi ever! Never go there again. All 3 or 4 king of sushi we ordered was terrible. [REVIEW_13] Loved the Bourbon flight! Bartender was attentive; and another bartender offered his opinion on the bourbon when he asked. Very friendly atmosphere. [REVIEW_14] I've been to this Chili's three times since moving to Reno a few months ago and I won't be back. Each time we've gone; we've waited to be seated with barely anyone in the restaurant and not acknowledged by the staff. When the hostess finally came up she was like a zombie and was half awake.  Our waitresses each time were different girls but both acted like they were irritated they had another table to serve. Very unfriendly and tried to rush us through the process. When we ordered we asked our waitress what the choices of sides were and she rolled her eyes and put a menu in front of us and said; ""they're listed in here"". So sorry to put you out! The chicken in my tacos was hard as a rock. When we were leaving; the hostess was at the door talking with a waitress about what they did on New Years and completely ignored us when we left. If your only job is to greet; seat; and open the door for customers; you should be fired because you couldn't handle one aspect of your job. Sorry; but if you're making your living off customers and tips; learn some customer service and get your attitude straight. [REVIEW_15] I didn't like this place at all. Those devil eggs things were disgusting and this seems more of a bar than a restaurant. Good bloody Mary's but that was it [REVIEW_16] Michael who took my phone order and greeted me was very polite and professional! That's hard to find- great customer service! Good job whoever hired him! [REVIEW_17] I got the lavender latte with an espresso shot and a sticky toffee pudding. The menu is fairly standard with some creative flair and they have some beer/wine for a chill happy hour. The staff were super friendly and helpful and it is a great place to sit down at one of the tables and read or study. The sticky toffee pudding when warmed up was super delicious and I'd totally go back for one of those any day. [REVIEW_18] Was blown away by this place. Not the highest rated BBQ place in town; but tried it after a suggestion from a local.  I think I liked this place so much because the brisket rib is heavy on black pepper.  I like peppery meats and jerky; so this peppery crusted brisket was right up my alley.  The sides were good; and didn't seem like an after thought. Ribs were tender and fall off the bone. [REVIEW_19] Excellent food! I am a Thai food junkie; and have travelled to Thailand and throughout Southeast Asia several times. There is ok Thai food in Nashville and then there is Great Thai food. This place was GREAT! The decor is a little dated but who cares...I was there for the food; which is fabulous!!! [REVIEW_20] The blue version of Razoo; this is a bunch of sweaty tourists who will crowd and probably vomit on you.  Everytime i walk by the place; House of Pain is on:  ""Jump! Jump around! Jump! Jump around!"" [REVIEW_21] I just read through all of these reviews and giggled over everyone's unique opinion on what exactly the Goleta K-Mart smells like. My own instincts whisper to me ""cat pee."" And yes! a little sulphur (read that in someone else's review; thanks!) Having lived with cats all my life; it smells like home. This isn't a good thing.  It's almost impressive how bad the check-out is. You can find the shortest line; where there is one or no people in front of you; and it will STILL take you like 20 minutes to get through the line. The last time I went; my nail polish rang up as $82 for some weird fucking reason (probably because their computer system is from like 1983) and then the girl had to do the whole thing over again. The penultimate time I was here; I managed to get in a very short line only to have the lady in front of me decide to sign up for a Sears credit card (REALLY WHO DOES THIS SHIT) at the check-out. Which took an impressively long amount of time. Will I still come here to buy my hair dye? Sadly; yes; because it's like half the price of the grocery store. And lord help me if my natural hair color starts growing in.  Also; I seriously almost run someone over every time I try to park. Not in anger; but just because it seems like the elderly like to hide behind cars and then jump into my view at the last second. It's almost like a conspiracy. hmmm....  well; here's hoping someone finally finds the courage to blow the motherfucker up one day. [REVIEW_22] Local ice cream stand in business for over 55 years. Homemade ice cream; amazing milkshakes and chili cheese dogs are must try items on the menu. Bring cash; they don't accept plastic. [REVIEW_23] It's hard to put a label on this place as they have a pretty random selection of items from jewelry to beard oil to spices. Perfect place to pick up a locally made unique gift for that person you just don't know what to get. They carry gifts for him as well as for her. Hilarious greeting cards; tons of candles; elegant scarves; cute kitchenware. Also; seasonal and holiday things were available when I visited in December. Free spiced and spiked apple cider was available along with fancy cheeses and crackers. The staff was super nice and helpful. You can tell they are proud of their inventory. They carry several items that I've only seen at local art shows. I picked a simple pair of earrings that were made from stained glass windows to give as a gift. These were only $8.00; but most of the jewelry is much much more expensive as they are one of a kind. A wreath making class was happening out back! Overall a great little shop to get something different for those people in your life who are a little different themselves! [REVIEW_24] We had the pleasure of meeting Security Officer Art Moon at the Peppermill during Hot August Nights and were more than impressed.  We briefly spoke about the car show and weather and thought him to be professional; friendly and approachable.  But more impressive was the fact that we then watched him: pick up trash; talk to many people with a large smile on his face; help get a food order to a missing customer; all while clearly scanning everything around him and without even a hint of badge-heaviness.  If this is typical of they type of security the Peppermill hires; they are to be commended.  Thanks for your service; Mr. Moon; your work ethic and cheerful disposition are something to be aspired to. [REVIEW_25] ABSOLUTE CRAP!!!! I swiched after one night to the Hotel Intercontinental a REAL hotel!... The rooms are straight from the '70's no renovation. The happy hour was a JOKE and the food was groosssss. UGH [REVIEW_26] DISCLAIMER: this review is limited exclusively to my single experience last night eating prawn mee noodle soup at Penang.  Review: this dish was admittedly very fishy; which I was generally okay with. It almost tasted like the restaurant added fermented shrimp paste or something similar. That's also not an issue; in itself. However; it is now 8pm; and I have still not yet left my hotel room since getting back from Penang last night. I'm currently having the absolute worst food poisoning experience of my life.  According to my primary care physician; aka WebMD; it is likely that I have some form of aggressive salmonella food poisoning.  The other dishes looked good; and I'm sure the prawn mee is typically not vomit/diarrhea-inducing; but i hope this issue is addressed promptly. [REVIEW_27] So I have this problem in life.  For whatever reason; I like to grow my hair out as big and as untidy as possible.  My thick locks are wavy and what many would classify as ""unkempt"" when allowed to grow freely.  Not to say that my hair is dirty because I do wash it every day; but I just like the way my hair looks and feels when it is a booming mop.  There are other factors in life that when coupled with my lion's mane develop issues that need to be dealt with.  For one- I work at a financial institution; and as much as I would love to say that the world has developed into an open-minded; physical-appearances-don't-matter type of place (where everyone holds hands; endlessly sings lovable Cat Stevens songs; and skips along in unison); the reality is you all are a bunch of judgmental 'yotches who for some reason DO care about how my hair looks and think that it somehow makes me incapable of doing my job...  Well; maybe not *you*...  But definitely you there!  This ""feature"" of society (the part about judging a book by its cover) is multiplied 10-fold by the simple fact that I come from the Midwest.  OK- Chicago is cool and contemporary and all; but it still is the Midwest folks!  Or maybe I am the one that is delusional?  Maybe I just look rank with my wildin' out; big ass hair?  After all; it is my beautiful and fashionable wife who delicately reminds me a few times a year that my hair is; after all; something that needs care and styling; or at least a good hacking to.  Probably more care than the fine ladies at Hair Cuttery are capable (or more likely WILLING) of giving.  Which brings me to Dapper.  A friend of mine was raving about the job that these ladies do.  I pride myself in being quite open-minded; but was surprised to hear that it was a ""full-blown"" barber shop run by some tattooed punk rock ladies; ala roller derby style.  Where they offer complimentary beer and pool games while you wait for a chair to open up.  This alone wasn't enough to shock me; but the fact that it came from this particular friend.  What I mean to say is that if there was anyone in the world that I would guess did not give a crap about where he got his hair cut; it would be him.  He has had the same hair cut for over 15 years- military style.  So why go here; a hip place; clearly catered to those that are looking to pay a lot for a good haircut in a unique setting?  He then tells me because a cut is only going to cost $15.  To start the trip off; my hair was beyond the point where my wife was going to tolerate it much further.  I was at the ""wing"" stage; where the hair around my ear begins to uncontrollably flip up and look as if I did it on purpose with a hot curling iron or something (childhood evidence: http://static1.px.yelp.com/photo/YaQT9rb_q7LgQRD5Lhg8AQ/l ).    Winter in Chicago was coming!  I needed natural ear muffs!  As you can imagine- this ""excuse"" only goes so far.  So in I go; with wife in tow (I'm a poet and didn't even know it!).  We arrived only a short while before closing and I timidly asked if it was cool for me to still get a cut.  ""Of course!"" was the response; ""have a seat over there; help yourself to whatever is in the fridge and someone will be right with you!""  Hoping that they would turn me away for coming in too late; or without an appointment or whatever; I walked my shaggy self over to a couch and waited; stroking my long locks one last time before losing them (and about 5 pounds- my hair gets huge).  I was shortly called over by Jo; a fellow Illinoisan (is that what we are supposed to call ourselves?) by upbringing; who called me over and asked what I wanted.  ""I need a haircut; but don't really want one.""  After figuring out why I didn't want one (and agreeing with me; probably more out of kindness and empathy) she let me know I would be in good hands and that she would make things right.  Hair washed; and she goes into cutting.  Old-school style.  The way I remember getting it as a kid.  Nothing but scissors and straight razor.  No clippers (which I usually ask for a #3) with my cut.  And yet she got my noggin looking sharp; but still with some length and good shape.  Wings gone; or more like trimmed back; or tucked in or something.  I don't know how to describe the cut- but it looked really good!  Especially after the initial shock of losing my beloved; over-sized helmet; and realizing that I COULD in fact get my hair cut short and still have it look pretty good- and not have to spend a ton of money to do so!  And as for Jo- AWESOME.  She kept the conversation going and was into some really cool stuff!  I walked out with some weight off of my shoulders (figuratively and literally); and money left in my pocket.  Not to mention a very happy wife; who happened to start her night of drinking off the right way with a complimentary beer from that fridge.  Thanks Jo!  Wish you all were up here in Chicago...  I am sure for the same amount of dope service; I will be dropping $50. [REVIEW_28] I've been here a few times with no issues... this time was horrible! I guess because they were working on my teen they assumed they could cut corners and do a horrible;  sloppy job.  Word to the wise drive up a few blocks to LA nails at Bustleton/Bowler for real service. [REVIEW_29] Amazing Hotel!   The staff from valet to hotel registration; room service and housekeeping; bell desk very nice people.  Everyone goes out of their way to make sure all your needs are met.   The Florence Suite in the Tuscany Tower is amazing.  Wonderful view of the pool area.   The Spa Tuscana is absolutely wonderful.  The Terrace Lounge is a great place to just hang out with friends and have a cocktail and listen to live music.  Biscotti's restaurant is very good; Tommy the server there is so nice. Bimini Steak house is incredible; pricey but a wonderful treat if you can afford it.  All in all; the best hotel I have ever stayed at.  Thank you everyone for an amazing birthday week. Will never forget it!! [REVIEW_30] Out lunch today was pulled pork; smokehouse bowl; and delicious sides of sweet potato casserole and red beans and rice.   Red beans and rice was spicy but good. Sweet potato casserole yummy and meat was smoky juicy and plentiful. Definitely a must.",16
56,"[REVIEW_1] Fast Track is a very nice and clean urgent care center.  My wait time was the time it took me to fill out my paperwork.  My insurance was verified quickly.  The medical assistant was very friendly and took me back immediately.  The Dr. was very professional and very polite. She was able to quickly diagnosis me and sent my prescriptions electronically which was a huge help. I highly recommend this urgent care center. [REVIEW_2] Ate at First Watch one morning while in downtown Indy for a conference. Initially went here simply because it was the closest place to the skywalk system but was surprised with the quality of food in a largely tourist focused downtown area. I ordered the new cold brew coffee and carrot cake pancakes. The cold brew was one of the best I have ever had and the carrot cake pancakes were also excellent.   Service was excellent as well. I made it clear when I entered that I needed to make this a quick visit and the staff were more than willing to accommodate me by moving the ordering process forward at a quick pace. [REVIEW_3] Such a breath of fresh air and a relief from the numbingly bad diners that we have here in Largo Clearwater. This place is excellent beautiful clean and the food is so well presented and so very good. Fresh ingredients friendly waitstaff outdoor dining and mimosas you can't beat it. [REVIEW_4] Wonderful food and EXCELLENT service!  More often it is a miss when a state-side restaurant has a prix fixe menu.   Sbraga had unique choices for every course.  it was actually difficult to narrow it down since i really wanted one of each. My husband and I lucked out and sat at the chef's counter and watched them bring out plates upon plates of beautiful entrees. It's not a large restaurant - it would be great place for a date-night or medium size party. [REVIEW_5] I love this place! The nail tech is so courteous and does exactly what you ask. They are a little understaffed on Monday and Tuesday with only one technician doing powdered nails and the other with manicures or pedicures; so be sure to make an appointment! [REVIEW_6] Always worth the wait. Filling this review out after I've gone a few times (5-6 times). Immaculate baked goods; inspiring latte combinations; creative soulful brunch food. I recommend grabbing a latte and a baked good to munch on while you wait.   I've had few dishes I haven't loved.  I normally find it hard to narrow down the options; I normally ask the wait staff bc there always seems to be a few dishes that rise above the others. The sorghum bacon is always pretty impressive and a crowd pleaser and I've definitely ordered a few different versions of the Dutch baby. Happy brunching! [REVIEW_7] I requested service because my gas oven heating was unreliable: sometimes; when turned on; it would heat as expected; other times it would not heat and I would smell natural gas odor. I was delighted; from the beginning of the process to the end: the person who answered my phone call on Monday and scheduled my appointment was friendly and helpful; appointment was scheduled for Wednesday; which was earlier than appointments offered to me by other appliance repair services that I had called; communication from company - by phone; email; and text - was well-timed and clear; repair technician was on-time and personable; he diagnosed the problem and fixed it efficiently (he had; based on the description that I had given when requesting the appointment; anticipated the cause and brought with him the required replacement component; an igniter); the company waived the service call charge - I paid for the repair (parts and labor) only. [REVIEW_8] The absolute best service and results I've had & I have several vehicles.  HIGHLY recommend! [REVIEW_9] Just ordered delivery from this nice pan-Asian restaurant. The food came quickly and the staff was extreme nice. Both the basil duck dish as well the kimchee dish were delicious. Diverse; different menu featuring less-common but very delicious Burmese; Malaysian; and Thai cuisines.   A great addition to the neighborhood! [REVIEW_10] this is a great place to hold mixers; and business meetings; like Your Business Network (YBN); it is local and so far what I have tried there is good; capuchinos; croissants; chai tea; and others are good; the staff is friendly and clean.   I like it very much to meet with clients and supporting local business is the way to improve Reno's economy.  House wine is good and inexpensive; great venue to host reunions.  good job! [REVIEW_11] Fantastic service food was great such a nice Irish Pub. We felt like we were visiting Ireland all over again. [REVIEW_12] Great; local breakfast joint. Great diner feel; with great breakfast food including classics and classics with a twist! I got the steak and eggs and it did not disappoint. Plus; the shrimp and corn soup (their specialty) was really yummy; even for breakfast. Worth checking out if in the Old Jefferson hood. [REVIEW_13] Ok. I am not the type to complain; but I have been here twice and both times I have had terrible service at the bar. The first bartender served me but acted as if I was bothering him.  This second time; with a completely different bartender mind you; it was worse. I am not dressed like a street person or anything; and I am not pan-handling. But you would think that I was the way he acted. First; I sit at the bar and I am waiting for service. So; the bartender walks by me; pours a glass a water; turns in front of me; puts the water down; gives me some stupid half-grin then walks off. Not one audible word of greeting or a grunt passed between his lips. Then; he gets a menu; drops that down and walks off again! Not a sound. Is it me; but when a customer enters an eating establishment; shouldn't they be greeted in some manner?  Not looked at like ""why are you here. I have better things to do""?  I am not looking for a royal salute or anything. Just ""Hey man; what can I get ya?""  or something to that affect.   Anyway; I start to look at the drink and food menus. Then; a group of anywhere from 10-15 people come in behind me and say; to what looked like a manager; ""We don't want to eat; is it ok if we just have a few drinks at the bar?"". The manager says ""Sure."" The guy then says; ""Can we get few beers down here""? (paraphrasing). The bartender says ""Sure!"" and proceed to service this group; one-by-one; as they order drinks. Ok; fine technically; I was looking at the menu when this started. But still; he walked back and forth; right in front of me; for about 10-12 minutes. Not once did he say; ""Hey; just shout and I will get you something""; or ""Hey man; just give me a few minutes and I will be right with you"". Nothing!  It was obvious it was a big group; but I mean; he gave no acknowledgement to the fact that I was sitting there waiting!   Long story short - after this 10-12 minutes of waiting; I just walked out and went somewhere else. Now this place has about 4\5 stars with around 500 reviews. So; I guess people like it. But their bartenders are as unfriendly as I have ever encountered.  Maybe if you get a table it's different. [REVIEW_14] My family LOVES Frost.  This is the only place we go when we want a cool treat!  Love every flavor that we've gotten. My favorites are dark chocolate and salted carmel! [REVIEW_15] This is one of our favorite spots in Nashville.  It has recently been remodeled and looks great!  The patio can get loud; but other than that no complaints. [REVIEW_16] I've used Merrigans several times for work on both a 2012 RV and a vintage 1984 Dolphin. They aren't the best at always answering the phones or calling back but they are the best at fixing what's wrong at a fair price. Your patience will be rewarded with a quality repair at a fair price. It's an honest mom and pop shop that has an eclectic collection of parts for older RV's along with the know-how and experience to fix anything. Definitely the place in Tucson where you won't get ripped off for work on your RV. If you want it done right and still have money left in your travel fund; go to Merrigans. They also have a FREE 24 hr. dump station WITH water. [REVIEW_17] I was looking for a florist close to where my relative lived. Since she lived close to Tampa I decided to give Ibritz a try.  According to my sister-in-law her birthday bouquet was absolutely gorgeous. And Ibritz came through. Her flowers arrived on her birthday! [REVIEW_18] This is My favorite place and the food here is very delicious. The foods made me unforgettable; that why I keep coming back to this restaurant. Thank you for so much. Great job; keep going!!!!..... [REVIEW_19] Horrible customer service! Went into sprint explaining we didn't want a contract. Irvin assured us that they had a program that would fit what we are looking for. After having some issues with service; not receiving/sending text successfully and having the phones looked at with no success; as well as the fact you can't access data while on the phone hinders my productivity with work we opted to cancel service. We were told that with a lease all you would have to do is turn back in the phones at any time in good shape and you could cancel service. When we went to store they wanted $650 per line which totaled over $100 more than what the phone cost in order to break my ""contract"". They then said well your not on a contract you are just committed to the phone for 24 months and there is a ""option to buy fee"" you pay of you want to ""break your agreement"". I explained that isn't what was explained to us. On top of that our 3rd phone is on a totally different payment option of installments. So that is a totally separate fee for cancellation even though it's on the same family plan. These people are shady; and if you go to a corporate store they will basically call this store the red headed step child of sprint; and of course will take no accountability even though they told us our account was totally incorrect and illogical the way it was set up. So don't trust what they say they will lie just to get you to sign the contract and after 14 days you are stuck. [REVIEW_20] Great bang for your buck; sushi was fresh and tasty; service was fast and kind. Definitely recommend [REVIEW_21] One of our favorite spots! Never a disappointment. Friendly staff. There is a manager... blonde woman not sure her name but always checks to see how customers are doing. She's very bubbly and outgoing:) Portabello Chicken is the best! [REVIEW_22] Called to make an appt and didn't make a reservation cause the person that answered the phone was zero help and acted like they didn't want to help me. [REVIEW_23] I've been using no label for a few months now via Market Wagon. As someone with Celiac disease; I can honestly say I've tried my fair share of gluten free things. No label is by FAR the best gluten free bakery--for bread; cookies; brownies...ANYTHING! Unfortunately I am on the far south side of the city and rarely make it to the north side; so I haven't been able to visit their store front until now. Ive had to use market wagon to get their breads and baked goods. I was so excited to finally be able to visit them. They were actually fairly busy when we went on a Saturday late afternoon. We got in and out quick and they were very helpful. I didn't see any bread out; but if you don't see any--be sure you ask! They had a ton in the back; they just keep it in the fridge! We purchased a LOT since we aren't able to make it up to Carmel much. We purchased a loaf of white bread; a cereal bar; peanut butter brownie; and nutter butter cookie sandwich. Everything was so great! My husband isn't gluten free; but he even loved everything he tried. I love no label and will always use them for my GF baked goods! [REVIEW_24] It was my 30th birthday; and Ralph's food was all that was on my mind.  I was thinking about veal since I knew that Italians really do make it best.  My husband and I stopped in to make a reservation for later that night and the host was very friendly and said ""We don't have anything open until 8:30pm"" but that was no problem for us and we just strolled around the surrounding area and stopped in a few shops while we were waiting.  At 8:15 we came back and our table was ready.  We sat down and were promptly served a nice cool glass of ice water.  My husband ordered an Italian Kiss which is some sort of espresso mixed drink.  He said it was out of this world.  A few minutes later we were served some delicious Italian bread and butter.  The bread was wonderful.  We then placed our order after looking over the menu.   We got the escargot as our appetizer.  This was absolutely wonderful!   My husband knew he wanted the Seafood Pescatore.  I decided to have the Veal Marsala and a side of meatballs.  We enjoyed our bread until our meals were brought out.  Now my Veal Marsala was hands down the best dinner out I have EVER had.  The veal was tender; the mushrooms were delicious; and the sauce;  well I think I had dreams about it that night.  My husband's dinner was also wonderful.  He used to prepare this himself and was surprised at how fresh and tender the mussels were .  He said he would get that again.  Now the meatballs are something you HAVE to get if you go to Ralph's!!!  These were nice and firm and the gravy was wonderful!  After all this good food we had to finish off the night with a cannoli.  My husband and I both ordered one and got one to go for my Dad.  Well those were crisp and the filling was the best i've ever had!    We will be returning to try more of their food.  Thank you Ralph's for making my 30th birthday incredible! [REVIEW_25] Loved it me and a group of my coworker went for lunch and came back ready to sleep. Definitely going back! [REVIEW_26] I just went here for the first time today; and I LOVE it. I got a regular manicure for $12 (not including the $10 I tipped her); but I would have happily paid twice that. The manicurist worked quickly and professionally and was very attentive to detail. The little hand massage was great and she made sure that I was happy with how my nails were looking as she went. The whole process took about 45 minutes and my nails are flawless. All three ladies that were working were very sweet and accommodating. The salon itself is very clean with new-looking furniture and equipment; and the decor and lighting is quite calming. I'm definitely going back next week for a pedicure! [REVIEW_27] Daria is a godsend! Twice now when my boyfriend and I have had to leave town; she's watched our two kitties and done a fantastic job. One of our cats is not super social; and she LOVES Daria. So much so that when she came to get the key; our cat came running to her - she doesn't do that for anyone! That's how you know your animals are being well loved in your absence. I don't have to stress; knowing that my babies are being taken care of. And she comes to your house! No worrying about upsetting your animals by having to board them somewhere. Also; it's incredibly simple to set up - now that we're acquainted; all I had to do was text to set up a house sitting arrangement for 8 days. I don't know what I'd do without Daria and Soulard Pet Sitters. If you're looking over your pet sitter options; pick this one. Trust me. [REVIEW_28] Delicious food and friendly folks; no better combination ! John and I ordered 2 salads and the BiBimbap skillet to share. All food was fresh with lots of flavor. Crispy rice at bottom of skillet was divine. Definitely worth getting off interstate on road trip today a fabulous and healthy lunch. [REVIEW_29] I'm bummed I didn't review about this bakery right away. I can't remember the exact cake I got but it was AMAZING. It was some chocolate strawberry concoction with cheesecake in the middle. We left it out on the table for about an hour and yet; when we finally got to the cake; the cheesecake part was still chilled enough to not be mushy. It was absolutely scrumptious. I'll definitely be back to get more in the future! [REVIEW_30] My favorite hotel!!!! along with their sister Hotel the Avalon next door. I live about a hour away but come as often as I can because there's so much to do here. The pool; food and drinks are amazing; along with their extremely friendly staff. Perfect for a special occasion; birthday or just a relaxing get away. They are also pet friendly which is a huge plus. They have a shuttle to take you downtown and pick you up and they always have something fun going on at night.",27
57,"[REVIEW_1] My partner stopped here on her way after work to pick up a carryout order. The cashier refused to accept her groupon because her tablet was not connected to the internet. So; she called me at home to make the 20 minute drive to her location to use my device (which has a data plan) to complete the purchase. Upon arriving; I asked the cashier ""If you were in my shoes; what would it take to make this order worth it; considering that the pizza will be 40-50 minutes old by the time we get home?"" The cashier's response was to assure me that delivery customer's pizzas were at least this old by the time they received them. I took this to mean that no; this was indeed not worth the headache. We refused the order; cancelled our groupon purchase and took our business elsewhere. [REVIEW_2] Just in Philadelphia for a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon -- our first visit.  Wanted outdoor seating and chose RR because the tables seated 3.  Big mistake.  We were seated at about 1pm.  Drinks came pretty quickly and the server was very nice.  We ordered a Cheese Steak; Hot Roast Pork and a Rueben all with fries.  After an hour we started asking about our lunches; at one point the servers said that our order was about 1/2 prepared.  Wait. What?  An hour+ for three sandwiches?  They said they were slammed.  We could see three open tables outside and two other tables seated after us had already received food.  Lots of ""I'm sorries"" from the wait staff.  We insisted on a complimentary round of drinks (which they did agree to).  When the food finally came; the Roast Pork sandwich and fries were completely cold (guess that was the half that was done on time).  The pork was fine; but the roll just average and the gravy was awful.  Fries; meh.  Cheese Steak filling looked like ground beef and was a miniscule portion in a large grinder roll.  The Rueben looked OK.  We should have checked reviews before sitting down; but it was getting late and we just wanted to catch a beer and a sandwich. [REVIEW_3] My fault for falling for the $6.99/lb filet (or maybe another cut; it was a month ago and I can't remember that specifically) and buying 2 (one for me; one for fiance).  Shame on me for not cooking it on the day I bought it; apparently.  Because when I DID go to cook it the next day (yes; that's right) it had turned brown and smelled awful.  Note that the other items in my fridge were fine (including other raw meat); so I suspect this was on its last legs when I purchased it.  Did I worry about being able to return it?  No...I go in there all the time (laziness and convenience) and in fact had been there 4 times that weekend because I was baking something and kept forgetting key ingredients.   So I went in; without my receipt; to ask if I could exchange it for a fresher piece of meat (I really had my heart set on steak).  Tito; the manager; gave me a super hard time about not having the receipt...I explained that I'm not used to having to keep the receipt in case the food I bought was SPOILED; but he didn't care.  He then proceeded to tell me that maybe it was my fridge; that I really needed to receipt; and to generally balk at my attempt to politely receive a refund or new steak.  Finally; he gave in and I got 2 new steaks; but that wasn't the end.  He stopped me to inspect them on my way out and started saying again how he thought I had either left them in my fridge; or my fridge was broken.  I commented that if I had the same issue at DiBruno Brothers; I wouldn't be put through this grief; to which he responded; ""Well; we aren't DiBruno Brothers"".  No shit.  I emailed them and commented and of course heard no response.  I really wish that the little grocery at 20th and Spruce was better stocked; because I this place blows and I don't enjoy going there.  GAH! [REVIEW_4] The donair meat was very cheap tasting....like it came out of a can or something gross.   The place looks run down.  We won't be back.  People who think this is the best donair have lived a very sheltered life in the land of donairs!  This is probably one of my worst ones! [REVIEW_5] I loved this place.  Walking by; I almost didn't go in; because Im a vegetarian and it looked like there was only meat on the menu. I'm glad that I looked closer. They have an excellent veggie burger; a terrific selection of local microbrews and they even make their own ice cream. I would definitely go back here again the next time I visit St. Louis. [REVIEW_6] Just as many others have stated; I too had a work related gathering here. This was my first time attending and the event had a set menu. Maybe next visit I'll see their actual menu. Being vegetarian when I saw my group had already chosen either fish or steak I knew I was gonna have to be THAT person and ask for an alternative. The host; of course; were more than happy to accommodate me. They mentioned their Sweet Potato Agnolotti so I accepted. It was amazing. I also enjoyed their house Cabernet a lot. The room that was reserved for us was on the second floor. It was nice to be able to mix and mingle on the balcony before our event began. The host were phenomenal as well. I can't wait to return. [REVIEW_7] Best beef noodles in town; I love their beef noodle soup; fried tofu; chicken with basil; I think almost all their food on their menu are really authentic Taiwanese Cuisine and another great deal is their price are very reasonable and affordable.  Place and environment are always clean; I'm so happy for them that they expanded their place they have more tables now than before. [REVIEW_8] Amazing food. If money were no object; would eat here every night. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The seafood stew is unique and delicious! [REVIEW_9] Tonight I went to Superior Grill expecting a delicious tex mex meal with great vibes. First it began with the rude waitress; then the manager came over and made in an appropriate ""joke"" regarding my ethnicity. The cherry on top to this awful evening was when i was served lifeless skinned rubber meat on a platter with lettuce and PEANUT SAUCE; what mexican restaurant puts peanut sauce on a salad. I would recommend not going here EVER unless you want slithery chicken weenus sliding down your throat. [REVIEW_10] Called in to pick up my order but when I arrived they acted as though they never spoke to me. I was told I'd have to wait an extra 10 minutes on top of the 15 minutes of previous waiting. The food was undercooked and the service staff was incredibly rude. I'll never return to this place. [REVIEW_11] Food frozen with taste of freezer burn. Over priced for what you get. Nothing interesting everything is average food that can be purchased anyplace else for less money.  Love the interior everything else under average. [REVIEW_12] Stayed here the day of our wedding. The first room smelled like cigarettes. The second room smelled like chlorine. Mind you I don't have a good sense of smell either. [REVIEW_13] Wasn't impressed. My friend got a terrible tattoo there.Maybe that's why its so far away from town.vape and tattoo? I hear vaping is not allowed in tattoo shops. Hack artists trying to pretend tattoo. [REVIEW_14] 3 calls to say when they'd come never happened. Our ""Guaranteed morning appointment"" became ""we'll try to get there in the morning"". Nobody can reach the installers; no management is available on the weekends; ""printing problems have delayed the ability to call customers back"" (actual quote); being told to wait 10 hours on a Saturday isn't convenient; something they touted in their sales process. Salesman **Name Redacted** thank you for ""not being able to do anything"" but being happy to sell the carpet.  (message me if you'd like the salesman's name)  Morning appointment; its 2:21PM currently; no carpet. [REVIEW_15] Really love their food; IMO the best chinese in chinatown.  Stars of the menu are the hot and sour soup (unlike any that you've had) and the General Tso chicken (again; unlike any that you've had more tempura style than the greasy chunks of fried chicken you get elsewhere).    If ordering the General Tso chicken; ask for the sauce on the side; you'll thank me later. [REVIEW_16] So something with this truck must have changed; because I just went here for lunch and it was on point. I got the BBQ Meatball sandwich. The guy is definitely a joker and says what's on his mind; but nothing was insulting. Meatballs were hot and had soft texture. Sandwich roll is fantastic. Hoping people give this place a go because I'd go back for sure. [REVIEW_17] The is the biggest SCAM!!!! Do not order from this company! I paid $134.00 for merchandise I NEVER received. There is NO one that answers the phone and you cannot leave a message. [REVIEW_18] Stayed here three nights on business.  The property is located very close to the airport but you really don't hear it.  The rooms are standard TownePlace Suite rooms with a refrigerator; stove; etc..  The area in which the hotel is located is quiet with a combination of other hotels and office buildings.  It's about a 20 minute drive to the downtown or university area.  About 5-10 minutes from Pima Air Museum.  There are not too many restaurants close by but there are some fast food options and a sandwich place called Baggins that was really good and within walking distance.  The staff of the hotel was really friendly and helpful.  The breakfast is standard continental with a couple of hot options. They also have a reception on weekday evenings.  My only complaint is that the food and drink go quickly so get there early.  You could use this as a dinner if you wanted.  I got there about 45 minutes after it started and although there was food left there were very few soft drinks left (no diet).  They could improve by keeping the area stocked throughout the period.  Anyway; the rooms are nice; beds are comfortable and area is safe. [REVIEW_19] I last reviewed this place three years ago when the host at Ru San's refused to seat my family (with small child) on a not very busy early evening.  I actually avoided the place for some time and had long wasabi laced affairs with places like Fujiyama in West Nashville.    I recently returned for a late nite bite with a boy and it was significantly mediocre to warrant an update.  Like my crumbling relationship; RuSans chokes itself on sad attempts to dress up what was always low quality.  The washed out party techno and poor lighting is like being in the expositional scene of a romantic comedy set in New York. But not in the good way. The bloated menu is utterly ridiculous and stopped impressing people in 2004. The sushi; like our attempt to still enjoy sharing a meal together; was just pathetic. 90% rice; soggy seaweed; and overloaded with a sweet sauce.  I'm breaking up with you (again) RuSans. I wish you the best but I'm afraid that the Gulch is a big sea and there are plenty of other fish. [REVIEW_20] The atmosphere was very trendy and hip; food was very well prepared; dishes were on the small side; staff was extremely knowledgeable. This is a new hotspot in S. Tampa. The food was decently priced; very reasonable for the quality.   I had the Prime Sirloin. It was prepared beautifully. Meat was very tender and delicious. Also had the meatballs as a side; probably the best meatballs I had ever eaten; only downfall was you only get 3. The bread was fresh baked and delicious as well. [REVIEW_21] Good and fast service....meat is always very juice ....BBQ sauce is great...prices are reasonable...if you this truck around stop and try you won't be disappointed [REVIEW_22] Ordered food at noon. Waited 55 minutes for two salads. Friend ordered House Salad; when it arrived it was spring mix; red onions; cucumbers. No cheese; bacon; tomatoes; pecans. When questioned; response was ""the chef changed it."" Without asking the customer?? And to what....the only items we have prepped? Asked for the manager but was told she was in the kitchen.  Guess that sums it up. Obviously will never go back.  One day later UPDATE: A marketing team member reached out to apologize and offered complementary meal as his personal guests should we want to try again. Hope this is indicative of a team trying to right the ship. Stay tuned. [REVIEW_23] Hands-down my favorite restaurant in New Orleans. Fantastic happy hour with $.50 oysters and half-price drinks from 4-6. Amazing gumbo; tuna; and even the burger is phenom. Wow. [REVIEW_24] I wish I could give zero stars to this poor excuse for a restaurant... On the way back from Philly to our beach house recently; my wife and I stopped in for a sandwich.  We were led to a nice booth and greeted by a young girl waitress.  My wife ordered a grilled cheese and asked for some DICED tomatoes in it.  The young waitress repeated the order back and said of course- no problem.  I ordered the veggie bean burger and she asked how would I like it cooked- which was odd; but I added ""medium please"".  I ordered iced tea for my wife and me and added onion rings to my order.  A full 28 minutes later our sandwiches appeared.  My wife's order came with SLICED tomatoes- no biggie- and she just ate it anyway;  I attempted to bite my burger and  roll and nearly broke a tooth on the over-microwaved wheat roll. My wife laughed as the entire burger fell out onto the plate splattering ketchup and mustard on my polo shirt. 5 minutes later the waitress reappeared and I explained that perhaps something had gone awry in the kitchen and she quickly brought me a new roll.  This one was mostly frozen... so I told her never mind- I'll just eat the patty and tomato/lettuce.  The patty was cardboard but I ate it anyway... my wife was busy dabbing my shirt to remove the mustard/ketchup stains when the waitress came back to apologize that the cook was overwhelmed by a party in the next room. (Odd; since there were only 8 or 9 cars in the lot outside.)  She was very timid about offering the explanation and I just accepted it as not totally her fault but rather (I assumed) an intimidating short order cook in the back somewhere.  Upon leaving; I advised the floor manager at the register very quietly about the roll and she made a face and took off three dollars from the bill since ""you ate the burger part""... with no apology or attempt at customer service. The waitress got her full tip.   I was so angry that I vowed to open a yelp account and DID!  Avoid this place at all costs. [REVIEW_25] Came in on a Friday and the food and service was terrific. I had the cod fish special with carrots. The cobbler desert was amazing.   The interior is nice and the chairs are also super comfortable. This is my new favorite place! [REVIEW_26] Awful. We switched years ago to AT&T because of Charter's terrible service; surprise charges; crappy equipment and AWFUL; AWFUL; AWFUL customer service. A salesman showed up at our door the other day saying that things were better and customer service and the company had an overhaul. He promised that the Internet would be faster and better than the one we were using; saying that each device would be connected to 100mb; not every device sharing that 100mb; our cable would be the exact same and we'd have a land line on top of it all for the same price that we were paying with AT&T. Absolute crap! We had the most basic of basic channels and the Internet was MUCH slower than AT&T. We were less than 24 hours in with Charter and attempted to get things corrected. No one would work with us and offered to charge us more to have the same channels we had before. The salesman left his cell number for us to contact him should there be any problem whatsoever and he would correct it immediately. When we attempted to contact the salesman he didn't answer the first time; and anytime after that it went straight to voicemail. Back to AT&T it is. [REVIEW_27] Big store; decent selection; plenty of parking and rather convenient location. The building is well lit; Items are always stocked; and if you have trouble finding anything - employees aren't far to ask. Everyone seems in a positive mood; happy to greet you and happy to help. I am a big fan of the fresh squeezed juice; their sandwiches; and all the snacks you can buy! I don't do my regular weekly shopping here but I still stop in frequently and pick up a thing here and there when I need or have a want for it. I have no complaints about this location! It's wonderful! [REVIEW_28] This place is a disaster in slow motion.  I would avoid this place like the plague.  Most mornings the drive-thru service is so backed up it blocks traffic on Bloomingdale.  The traffic pattern within the property where the location sits is horrible.  Also the service; while my expectations are not high; is extremely slow and often incorrect.  This location is also not owned or operated by Dunkin corporate either; so if you have a problem that management does not resolve at this location; no one at corporate can do anything for you; you are just SOL.  I won't even go here to buy my beans anymore they have messed up that much; DD does have great coffee; but this place can mess that up to and has.  Bad management; no pride of work; and just not worth the time and money. [REVIEW_29] I have eaten here several times during the four years I have lived in Philly; and have had happy hours or cocktail events here as well; as an employee of a company in the building; and I have had wonderful experiences. This is thanks completely to the *servers; bartenders; and kitchen staff*. On Valentine's Day; however; we had a very different experience. I am confident that the servers and kitchen staff were amazing as always; but we never found out. We made our reservation about a month and a half early; to ensure a window seat. OpenTable asked for a credit card when booking--no problem; we provided it. Upon arrival; we were told that; since we did not place a deposit; there was not a table for us. Yes; they could see our reservation in the system; they said; they can see the date on which we placed the reservation; a month and a half prior. However; they claim to have called us (one time) to get a deposit from us; and since they were unsuccessful; they didn't hold us a table (again; they can see our reservation; they knew we were coming).  **No one had ever called to obtain a deposit from us.**  Further; had they needed a deposit; that should have been worked out between OpenTable and R2L--not our problem. OpenTable asked for a credit card and we provided one. Plus; how incredibly rude is it to require a deposit for a table reservation anyway? As a semi-regular at this place I find that greatly offensive. We weren't speaking with hourly-waged youngsters either; we started with a manager and were escalated to ""one of the owners"". Neither woman made an attempt to be friendly; let alone apologetic or accommodating in any way.  This lady who was ""one of the owners"" should definitely keep herself exclusively in the back of the house; away from any sort of paying customer.  I have never; as a customer; been treated so poorly or talked to so terribly. And; no; I can assure you; we were not out of line or yelling or making a scene or rude for our part; we just aren't the type. She was plain awful.  Never so much as a shred of an inkling of a hint of an apology or any effort whatsoever.  So; despite all of the rave verbal reviews I have given everyone I know about this place in the past; I will now make sure that everyone we know; meet; work with; or do business with--several of whom work in that building--does not ever drink or dine at R2L.  And; clearly; we will never step foot into the place again either. After leaving; we had an amazing meal with mind-blowing service at DEVON SEAFOOD. Go there instead! [REVIEW_30] Super tasty and enormous portions. Some unique flavors too. Not much else to say but an amazing ice cream store that others should try to emulate.",13
58,"[REVIEW_1] The WORST customer service!!! Never going back to any dots diner after this experience. If I could give zero stars that would be too much. [REVIEW_2] Really disappointed. I've been to the Marathon at 18/Spruce and had excellent service; drinks and food. Thought that would transfer to this location - not at all.  To sum it up; our server was extremely energetic; but not in a good way. More like a frantic energy. I was there to enjoy a few drinks and dinner with a friend who was visiting (AKA looking to spend money AKA you will get a larger tip if you let us stay longer) and we were rushed out. Server brought boxes for food we were still eating; without asking if we wanted them. A few minutes later he physically put the food in the boxes at the tableside while mumbling something like ""I don't like food sitting on the table."" .....we didn't even want to take it home. Next; when we said we were having another friend join for another round or two of drinks he told us we couldn't stay at the booth we were at and we needed to go to the bar. What? I point blank asked him if he was kicking us out of the booth and he said ""yes!"" energetically. There was no one waiting for tables and there were numerous open tables/booths around the restaurant. I felt extremely uncomfortable and wanted to leave immediately. Our friend joined after all this happened; and when the server came over to ask if they wanted a drink; he seemed surprised when we told him we were just going to leave. YOU LITERALLY just told us we couldn't sit at this table any longer!! We then left.  I worked in restaurants for a long time and I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to restaurant service. I was not pleased at all during this visit.  On another note; the food was not that great. [REVIEW_3] After getting my car damaged in a minor hit and run; I was told that Calvin's does great work at an affordable price. I used to live very close to the shop and was happy I could give my old neighborhood's shop some business. I called ahead and set a time; Calvin was very nice and professional. When I got there; he helped me right away. He started doing the estimate and started asking questions. While talking; I told him I already had a claim in for the damage. He immediately changed his tone; refusing to finish the estimate. Insisting my insurance company would not accept his estimate. This was very confusing since I already had my insurance company's estimate and the cash was in my account. I tried to explain it to him but he wouldn't listen to what I was saying. This was just a bad experience. [REVIEW_4] I've NEVER been to a Starbucks & have had to go inside & wait at least 4 minutes for a knife because they forgot to put one in my bagel bag; I've also never been to a Starbucks where they don't hand a single napkin. [REVIEW_5] We shop at acme pretty frequently. Today; we accidentally left a bag with a good amount of food in it at the self check out (pasta salad; cheese; etc). We noticed the moment we got home and immediately returned to the store. I also tried calling customer service twice to let them know and it just rang; and rang; and rang with no answer.   Well; when we got back - they were already reshelving our items! My husband had to go around the store and track everything down.   Are you freaking kidding me? You're telling me that they don't even wait for people to return before putting PURCHASED items back to sell AGAIN? There's seriously not a location where they put these items to give the buyers a chance to return?!   It was honestly a span of 20 minutes. That's ridiculous. [REVIEW_6] This has been one of my favorite chains for a while. I will not visit this one again. Slowest service I can remember anywhere. Food was cold when I got it. I will not be returning. [REVIEW_7] Found this place online as I am traveling across country with my dog. I was assured it was dog friendly and that they would do ""and and everything to accomodate my dog."" I dont expect much. I walked in the front entrance and had 2 servers walk within inches of me by the door and look at me as if i was in the way. I walked to the bar and a really friendly brunette bartender was super friendly. Thats the only high point. The server made it clear that we were a burden; 6 different staff members watched me wait for what i thought was a single person bathroom which turned out to be a 6 stall room. I even asked and they told me to wait. Ive worked in F&B for 16 years. I would fire the entire staff minus the one bartender (black hair; rasta tattoo on her shoulder; rasta necklace on; she was cool.) and get this place in shape. what a shame......not to mention the rare tuna panini was beyond well done; nothing like a canned tuna panini and shitty; rude service. [REVIEW_8] The apartments are ok but staff is worst when you left apartment for any reason. They charged me $500 for carpet replace even if carpet was in good condition. I will NOT recommend this apartment to my friends. [REVIEW_9] So I called and placed an order over the phone with pizza huts apparent call center. the little girl who sounded all of seventeen was very unprofessional no phone experience she messed up my order and put me on hold whole she had a side bar conversation about her friend finally showing up for work.  I say this because when I got there it was a all male crew! My order was wrong the lady had relayed a totally different order. The poor guy at pizza hut making pizza was so frustrated no his fault I totally understood at this point. He apologized and told me he would re make it right now correctly such a respectable man. Something between who takes the call somewhere else and who relays to the establishment has a disconnect. Annoying to have to drive all the way back! [REVIEW_10] It's like they have the blind leading the blind here. We ordered a deluxe pizza and when we opened the box; ALL of the cheese and toppings had slid off the pizza and into the corner of the box. It was as if he carried the pizza vertically. We actually laughed out loud when we saw it. Plus our roast beef sammy was way overcooked and dry... and missing the ""everything"" we asked for (lettuce; onion; pickle; tomato; mayo).  So we called back and explained the situation and they promised to send the remake out RIGHT AWAY. lol.... another hour later we got a nice looking roast beef sammy but a pizza that was even MORE jacked! There was not a single topping even hinged on the the crust of the pizza.  We called back again laughing. I said; ""I am not even mad; I am impressed. Let me send you a text image of this pizza- it is crazy."" He apologized profusely and promised to send another; but at this point it had been 2 hours and we had drank our sodas; and eaten our wings and had dinner plans so we refused another pizza.   At this point; the gentleman offered to bring us back our ten dolllars for the pizza and we accepted. He said he'd be by shortly but it was another hour before we saw him.  Total s-show. Avoid this location altogether. I have had far superior service at the U City or Maplewood locations. YIKES [REVIEW_11] Went to Amigos on our 40th anniversary citing the great reviews. Near to no atmosphere. Food was bleeeeah and the price was kinda high for what you get. Can't figure why people like their salsa so much as I think the stuff from ""NEW YORK CITY!!"" is as good and the chips are just the giant bag variety.  Gawd... all I want is some decent Mexican fare here in Boise!! Used to love Gloria's though not nearly as clean as one would like.  $47.00 with drinks and tip though I think one would do much better at one of the taco trucks as far as flavor goes. [REVIEW_12] Service today was soooooo slow. 1.5 hours today to get simple lunch. Food was also awful which was really the worst. Oyster Po boy was disgusting and couldn't eat half of it. My colleague couldn't finish his chicken blt either because it was so bad. One of worst meals I've had in a long time. Zero stars are more appropriate. Do no go here. [REVIEW_13] Went to lunch at Tavern today 8/29/17 with three co-workers who had never been before on my recommendation. It was a huge mistake on my part. Tavern had been ok on previous visits but today a real disappointment. Slow and indifferent service. Hidden costs-charges for extra salsa on already over priced nachos. Ordered extra chicken on the nachos- it was not on the nachos when they arrived-we were still charged for them because Tavern brought us a plate of luke warm chicken to pour on after we'd already finished. We asked about the hidden cost of the chicken and salsa our server rolled her eyes and let us know she does not make the rules. This place is way overrated; over priced and the douche bag factor is off the charts. Fu*k Tavern. [REVIEW_14] We always check Yelp before trying a new place.  Based on the reviews I saw here we were quite surprised with the meal we had.  Young waitress was very polite and accommodated our time crunch as we were trying to catch a show-the food however was pretty disappointing.  The sauce was very watery and the vegetables in the two dishes we ordered were frozen vegetables.  Watery spicy sauce on frozen vegetables- eh. [REVIEW_15] Awful! Typical Philly ""hot spot"" that appeals to hipsters and snobs that would rather have a ""scene"" than quality dining. We ordered several pizzas. They were thin with burnt crust and room temperature. Worst of all they were $15-16 a pop! Insane. I could stay in the suburbs and go to a mom & pop joint where real unpretentious folks go and get a pizza ten-times as good for half the cost!  Plastic chairs and little to no atmosphere. The service wasn't bad and that was the high point! I hate that places like this can actually be successful. A total half-assed effort catered to mindless hipsters and wannabes that think it's cool to do the Philly thing for a few years. Real Philly people know where to get Pizza and Vetri ain't it! [REVIEW_16] The service and bathroom was horrible; The soap Dispenser didn't work (and the toilets were out of order) Zaxby's need to do better with who they are hiring and the cleanliness of the store. The lady at the drive thru and the cooks did not have on a hair net. The sweet tea was sour; the ice machine took forever (it seems like) to dispense ice. The chicken strips and fries were dry. The person taking my order was not welcoming at all. All the employees on the front line seem to be playing around rather then working. A lot of lout talking coming from the back. Not a inviting environment at all; I will not come back to this location and I ""suggest"" strongly that ""You"" think about it twice before coming to this location. [REVIEW_17] I called on both days I took my car in to get tinted. The first time I was told to bring it in at 4pm but when I arrived I was told by the owner that he needed a minimum of 3 hours since they needed to remove the old tint and re-tint. I called them again two days later and asked if I could make a appointment. I explained everything that I discussed with the owner to the person on the other end and was told to bring in the car and they would be able to complete it within 4 hours along with a quote.  Once I arrived to the shop I was told the my car would need to be there the entire day and the amount I was quoted pretty much doubled. When I explained the issue to the owner he pretty much blamed me since I didn't make a appointment even when I told him that was the point of the phone call the morning of. I'm not sure if the employees don't communicate properly but they definitely need better communication and customer service skills. [REVIEW_18] Ok had Sunday lunch with my mother and grandmother here and it was just terrible. Our server didn't even tell us his name and took forever for him to take our drink order. We asked for sweet and low with one of our unsweet teas and didn't receive it. Had to ask for it again to then receive the sweet and low. We ordered the bloomin onion and the chesse fries. The bloomin onion was not the onion the restaurant usually uses because it was on the spicy side. The chesse fires when on the ok side since they did not put much chesse or bacon on the appetizer. So in all reality we ordered a plate of fires with a little chesse and bacon. My grandmother ordered the 6oz steak and it was also on the spicy side. I however ordered the same thing but I ordered mine medium rare but when I got my steak it was rare instead of medium rare and also was really spicy.  We then had to ask for a bottle of steak sauce because if you ask for steak sauce for a party of three you will only get one tiny cup full of steak sauce for the whole table. Had to order a to go order for my father couldn't make it to lunch and our waiter said he would put it in after we had finished our meal. When we finished our food and the waiter gave us our check we still haven't received our to go order. Had to sit and extra five to ten minutes to get that said order. Lets just say we gave a bad tip. Be caution to this place not worth a hundred dollar bill for a spicy mouth and bad experience! [REVIEW_19] I wish I could go back and time and not eat here. We waited 50 minutes for cold chips and salsa; they were stale and they didn't even have picode Gallo. They charge for them! The burrito was cold; and when I asked they said they plate was suppose to be cold. Really? Cold rice and beans too?  The margarita was the only good thing and the 80's music. [REVIEW_20] My sister; my great niece were at the Village and thought we'd give Cinnaholic's a try. I sure am glad we bought the mini cinnamon rolls but wish we hadn't bought any. The bread in the cinnamon rolls was dry (either cooked too long or stale); there was hardly any cinnamon filling and the toppings were horrible. Mine was supposed to be a standard cream cheese topping but it didn't taste like there was any cream cheese in it.  Maybe they gave me the wrong topping because it tastes like coconut. My sister got maple flavored which she did not like.  The 6 year old ate her cotton candy frosting but we did not like it.  To say the least; we scraped off all the toppings and still didn't eat all of the rolls. Perhaps this was a fluke but I seriously doubt we will come back to find out. Sorry.  I don't like writing bad reviews. [REVIEW_21] Horrible service!  There for an hour and a half and never got food. Six tables seated after us got fed and left. Our server said he didn't know what happened. When I asked to speak to the manager I was told he was cooking in the kitchen. We finally walked out. [REVIEW_22] Bus over an hour late before I gave up. Call centers not open to get information until after 6 am even though they have busses running at 4:35 am. Would not give refund and use terms and conditions item 14 as a blanket clause to not give refund [REVIEW_23] This used to be my go-to spot for mani and pedis; mostly because it was very close to my home. I moved to port Richmond about 6 years ago and about a year ago this place was taken Over by ""new management"" and completely changed and at all for the better.   When they first switched over the new owner would offer you champagne or wine and made promises of what else was to come. For example They offered your own tools to you if you were a frequent client ; and punch cards for rewards. However ; I watched the quality of this place go right down the drain. The service became slow and less accommodating. There's no way I could get out of there in under an hour mostly due to the inexpirienced techs who I felt were winging it. I started getting the worst work and have since moved on. Stay out of there locals ; there's way better shops out there! [REVIEW_24] outdoor pool not heated.  smelled cigarette smoke inside hotel; allows pets a negative for us; the eliptical exercise equipment was very strange; looked like it was with a bicycle.  couldn't figure it out.  will try a different hampton in Tucson next time.  been staying at this one for years; and it's gone downhill. [REVIEW_25] I had a Groupon for a Shellac manicure; Pedicure and Paraffin hand treatment. I didn't have too much of a problem getting an appointment over the phone though Brenda was very short with me.  Once I got there for my appointment with Brenda (which had been scheduled about 2 weeks in advanced) she was overbooked and asked me to come back later. I was unable to so she told me to come the next day. The next day I came back and was able to redeem my Groupon. It was a nice little shop but I did not see any sterilization of the nail tools. she carried them around in a coffee mug and there was nail dust everywhere;  She made personal calls during my pedicure and was very condescending when she spoke to me about my nails.  She also uses Bath and Body works lotion witch isn't a big deal but then she sprayed my legs with the body spray witch I thought was very strange and did not smell the greatest.  My shellac bubbled and didn't look the greatest and my nails were uneven. I also never got my Paraffin hand treatment because one of her ""usual"" customers came in and she was too busy talking to her to finish mine and I was very rushed at the very end.  She spent more time talking to others in the shop and on the phone than with me and was very condescending when she did speak to me. I will not be going there again and I will not be recommending this establishment to any of my peers. [REVIEW_26] terrible food and the manager was shockingly rude when I tried to return my food. I had the frogs legs and they were rubbery and tasted awful. I was disgusted by her behavior and she should be ashamed of herself. I have never been treated more horribly by someone. [REVIEW_27] Oh hertz shuttle; never to be found.  There goes avis again.  Alamo and national.  Sadly I stay loyal because you actually provide service outside of missouri. [REVIEW_28] The waitstaff were attentive and very nice! That is the only positive comment that I have for this establishment: I waited fir over an hour while moderate celebrities were ushered in. After all of the waiting the food was not good. Grits were hard and not seasoned; shrimp & fish over cooked; it was a disappointment. [REVIEW_29] From the looks of it; Helzberg really don't care much about the social media comments and their customer's satisfaction. Today my wife and I just came out of Macy's cancel one of the ring I bought her for Valentine's Day due to wrong size. I already knew their services have gone to the gutter in recent years; its worse than going to a car dealership; where you get judged by their superficial eyes. If they don't think you are going to buy; they don't want to waste a second on you. So I told the first lady who greet us straight up; I was looking for a diamond ring around $800; I showed her the picture of the ring we cancelled at Macy's; all I asked is something comparable in price for a gold diamond ring. She showed me one right away but the diamond was a lot smaller than what we were looking for.  But she was able to find another one; not perfect; but at least my wife liked. I asked her what is the best price she can give us; after some negotiation; she said there is a $150 discount; and because we were still unsure (the diamond was still a lot smaller than the one in Macy's for similar price); she said she would throw in resizing service for free. It was already around noon time; both of us were hungry and I didn't want to rush a decision like this; so I told her we will think over lunch and be back if we decides.   So later that evening; I got the chance to go out alone; so I went back to the store to make the purchase. Right away I made the mistake telling the ladies that are working there I was there earlier; talked to a tall older lady; and I'm ready to make the purchase. At the time there were three of them; one was busy with the customer; one was on the phone; then there is a lady completely free. But you can tell right away she does not want to help me since I was already here before; even she get some commission it will not be the whole commission. So she told me go talk to the lady on the phone... Then the lady on the phone doesn't seem to have any interest helping me either; kind of yelling across from the store to the other ""free"" lady something I didn't even pay attention. So I'm standing in the middle of them feeling unwanted by those two. Finally the first free lady ask me whats my name blah blah... after wasted few more minutes she finally asked me which ring. So I pointed to the ring and told her what price was promised me earlier. Again she asked my name (for what reason I don't know); then she asked me if I had the other lady's card (I wasn't very happy with the first lady's service to begin with; she often answered my question in a snobbish way as if we couldn't afford the more expensive ring like ""oh that's $3000...."" in a condescending tone. So even when I told her we will think over lunch she didn't bother to give me her card.    By now; the evening lady was trying to hint to the other lady I had no reference maybe she should just sell to me like a regular sale. The other lady obviously doesn't want her to get the complete commission (also it is breaking the industry rule). While all of them keep having the tone I was just making up the price which I was promised from the morning lady! So I said maybe you should call her up; most sales people who care about their commission wouldn't mind the phone call.  At first the evening lady doesn't seem want to (too much work to make a call you know); finally the other lady also suggest she should call. So she went to the back room for roughly 5 to 10 minutes (don't know why she couldn't just call right front of me; the phone is right there!)  She comes back and told me there are not even a $150 discount (even though there is advertisement for $50 off on $299 purchase; and we always get their catelog in the mail; usually is $50 for every x amount of purchase; the ring originally is $900; which made sense when the morning lady quoted $150 discount). On top of that; there is a free $300 speaker promotion going on for anything over $600; and the morning lady said I can chose $150 discount or the $300 speaker.   Anyway; my point of writing this review isn't even about not getting the originally quoted price; I sincerely hope who ever runs Helzberg Diamonds's marketing; online marketing; social media marketing or even if just the store manager who actually care about his or her store image; can take a look at their staff. The culture they are building has changed so much since we bought our wedding band over 10 years ago. I read few other people's review; they shared the similar feeling. Their staff are just bunch of vulchers.  I worked a commission job throughout my college years; I don't know what happened in recent years. these people on commission doesn't understand how to treat their customers; and just expect the customers pay their paycheck. This mindset became very sickening to the society! And they only pride on Mr Warren Buffeft's name but not his vision! [REVIEW_30] I recently bought $50 worth of hair products I was specifically looking for.  While I looked three salespeople were in a conversation a few aisles away.  When I was walking toward the cashier; one asked if I needed any help.  Yes about ten minutes ago!  The first thing the cashier asked me was; ""What's your phone number?""  Really?  No ""hello""; have you found everything you were looking for?""  I responded it was unlisted. She looked panicked and told me it didn't go anywhere.  Then why ask?  She then asked me if I had a daughter?  I could give her phone number.  OMG; totally inappropriate question.  Besides if I'm not giving you my phone number why would I give you my daughter's she assumed I had?  I told her I don't give out personal information.    I most likely will continue shopping there; but please stop this policy of asking customers for their phone numbers!!",0
59,"[REVIEW_1] I would do 0 stars if I could! This company took full payment for a bed and never delivered it. I sent 3 emails and many phone calls and not once did I receive a reply or call back nor did I ever receive an update on my purchase. The few times when someone answered when I called I was told it was on back order and then the day it was suppose to be delivered and wasn't; I called and was told it was discontinued. My money should have been refunded that day and in my account three days later( I was assured it was being refunded that day). It never got to my account and two phone calls later found out they never refunded it but was once again assured that they would refund it that day. I am now afraid I am going to have to take legal action to get my money back. I complained to managers and write emails but it does not seem to matter. Worst company and service ever!!! [REVIEW_2] Barry's is awesome!  Instructors are really nice and energetic; Antonio's the best!  I really like the Wednesday Chest & Back class.  Very clean; showers; and great products.  Do not need a lock for the lockers; super easy.  Playlist is great too. [REVIEW_3] A friend of mine recommended this restaurant when i told him i would be in new Orleans. I went with a group of friends with high expectations. Since we were 7 we waited for more than an hour to get seated; which we took in good stride we just sat somewhere outside and chatted. When we were finally seated; it took the them about 15 minutes to come and take our orders and then...the ordeal started; the waiter told one of my friends to hurry up and order(he had just delivered the menus) or he will go and serve another table. There were about 4 of us on the table who had not ordered yet and we asked if he can take our orders first instead while my friend made up his mind but no...he said we had to follow the order we were seated. We let that slide; but then he delivered the drinks in a leaking glass and the food took another hour to come. People who arrived after we were seated had finished eating before we even had our food. Needless to say...the whole experience was so terrible there was nothing special about the food. [REVIEW_4] Sadly I am revoking my 5 star review of Gallagher's. I went here last night and asked for their world famous nachos. Guess what; new menu. SERIOUSLY you're going to get rid of the awesome nachos?  No more frosted beer mugs plastic cups. And they also changed the prices on pitchers. PBR now $12 instead of $9. This will not stand.  I would also like to mention the place smelled like a ""radio rock festival"" or cat urine. It looks like Gallagher's is changing for their new lame clientele and they just lost a great customer. [REVIEW_5] We would have loved to try this restaurant but unfortunately we were told they had stopped serving food when we got there (we got there shortly before 10pm). The Eldorado website clearly stated that they served lunch and dinner until close. I was very unimpressed. We did not even have a chance to try their beer as we had been driving for 5 hours and needed food first. [REVIEW_6] I was really excited to try this location since I grew up eating at the downtown location.  I was horrible disappointed.  The atmosphere is nice. It's a quaint little area but  the quality of food that I received was far from what it used to be.  I order Alfred penne pasta with chicken and the chicken was tough and the noodles where so far over cooked it wouldn't even stay on my fork.  It slid right off in pieces. The Alfred was broken and oily.   The Caesar salad I received with it was just an average caesar nothing to talk about.  The garlic knots were hard. The wings I ordered were over cooked and unseasoned and dry.  My husband ordered a calzone that was soggy and greasy.   I'm truly sad and disappointed with this experience especially since the prices seem higher than the downtown location.  I'll just hold on to my memories but I won't be back. [REVIEW_7] Darn awesome. Love the ambiance; love the food; love the music. My father even drank whiskey here and loved it; which is just crazy making. Also very friendly and fun bartenders/staff. Highly recommended.  Only downside - it gets packed; and there's really no place to wait. [REVIEW_8] Muy mal. Servicio y me robaron ordene un pastel para 30 personas y me dieron uno para 10 personas y muy mal sabor y mal decorado tenga cuidado con sus ordenes [REVIEW_9] The bouncers are awful; but I would be too if I were 4-feet tall and had an infinite amount of pent-up aggression and shielded childhood memories.   This place stands for everything Reno shouldn't be. Choose LEX only if the sole alternative is being waterboarded during thanksgiving dinner. [REVIEW_10] We paid $230 per night for our stay during the Memorial Weekend and man how I wish I stayed at Motel 6 at next door instead. The location is prime - walkable to tons of cute little restaurant and even Whole Foods. However; the room was way too shabby - we can hear very loud TV noise from our neighbor rooms clearly; no mini fridge; the arrangement of furnitures was disfunctioning; only two table lamps in the entire room; including one doesn't even work; and the dark light makes the room more creepy.. The breakfast was similar quality to their room - very limited choice and low quality GMO products.  You probably can understand my disappointment knowing the price I paid now! [REVIEW_11] It just wasn't fun; or informative; or interesting; and the water portion-which is the thing that makes it different from other tours-is like 7min. and super boring. The guide wasn't great either; but for us at least they gave out the quakers at the end of the tour; being on the boat for 90 seconds with those things made the tour seem hours longer. There must be a better way to spend your money. I've been on duck tours in other cities and this one is the worst. [REVIEW_12] Great food at a great value! My favorite items on the menu are the Pho; Pork Bun; Bahn Mi; and the pot stickers are delicious!The Bahn Mi comes on true French bread (I recommend the pork belly). As for Pho; I usually get the beef with extra bean sprouts. Pork Bun is my favorite menu item; it comes with vermicelli noodles; cucumber; carrots; and more. The best server there her name is Tim. Ask for her if you want to get the best service! [REVIEW_13] Bad service; always out of things and rude when you ask them to refill it; pastries aren't great. Even when there are as many employees as there are customers; they simply ignore you and take personal calls!! Ridiculous!! [REVIEW_14] Did a Garden District Walking Tour with Val. He was very knowledgeable & patient. Because he lived in the neighborhood; we got into places we probably wouldn't have with another guide. Highly recommend. [REVIEW_15] As 45 put it best...  this place is a ****hole.   To the people in charge of the entire brand Steak and Shake:  take note of how Freddy's operates. Ditch the worthless waiters who understandably are as motivated to return to the table as I am the proctologist..   it's flipping 3.99 meals and half the customers are kids. Of course you won't make crap for tips.   Put up a coke freestyle machine and have people place and order up front. I'll get my own refills and napkins. Faster mind you and with pleasure.   PS.  It's not normal to had a 4 year old a fully loaded plate of food. [REVIEW_16] This is the best Vietnamese restaurant in town! I've seen them (Saigon) transition from a grocery store to restaurant. Their food is always amazing and you can never go wrong. The service can be sometimes feisty but it's all worth it. If you're new to Asian food you can never go wrong with the Viet (chicken; pork; etc.) grilled sandwich or the pho. [REVIEW_17] Well against my better judgement I went back to Freedom Smoke... I was in a bind and needed a tank so I called them first to find out if they had what I was after.   Brandon answered the phone and I explained that I wanted a Pro Tank because I had broken the threads off the base. He said he had some in stock; I then asked what the wait was like. He said they were pretty slow so I pressed on and asked if he thought I could get my tank and some juice in about fifteen minutes; he said more like ten. I was less than a mile away and when I pulled in it was more like 20 minutes just to get my order placed and another ten for my juice to come out. OMG!!! The only good thing to come out of this was they had the tank. The wait was ridiculous and to top it off the Starblast e juice was AWFUL!!!!  Will I finally learn??? [REVIEW_18] Terrible delivery service & food order was incorrect once received an hour over what I was told.  All the food was under or over cooked.  Never again!  Sad [REVIEW_19] After trying to talk Thai with Chef & waitress so I tried it here but come out super...disappointed :( Okay their menu has variety noodle styles to choose but not even one item that we love.  ie. we ordered (SUPER spicy) somtom came out just a plain salad on top with dipping sauce from the bottle; curry tasted suck even my white folks said so :(  Don't get me wrong; this restaurant may great for some local clients but I won't recommend you trying if you seeking for authentic Thai taste. [REVIEW_20] As a child; Friday's were my favorite day of the week.  Why?  The end of then work week my mother would stop at the then named Swiss Pastry Shop and pickup delectable treats for the whole family.   This ritual greatly contributed to a happy childhood.  I have loved the hazelnut sacher cake for too many years to count and am so happy that it taste just as good to me now as it did then.  I have introduced many people to the now Swiss Haus with nary a one ever being disappointed.  I recently had one of their gluten free almond joy tarts and it was delicious.  I so look forward to summer when they make key lime tarts...wonderful!  Thank you to the owners and bakers who through this shop's transitions have kept faith with old world recipes and traditions. [REVIEW_21] Ordered the Korean tacos made from naa bread and meat was very cheap. More than half the meat was fat. Also very little meat overall. Unfortunately did not like my experience. [REVIEW_22] I love 312 deep dish pizza. So much so; that the restaurant was on the short list of places I wanted to go during my last week in Nashville. I called last night to see how long the wait was; and was told that there was no wait. So my friends and I drove all the way across town for dinner at 8 pm. As soon as we asked for a table; we were told that they were out of deep dish. What?! How does a restaurant run out of their signature menu item?! And how did the person who answered the phone fail to tell me that when I called to ask about the wait? I would have appreciated the warning and would probably have delayed my 312 dinner for one more day.   We love the deep dish pizza so much that we decided to stay and try the thin crust. It wasn't until after we ordered; though; that our waitress told us it would be an hour wait! We know that's the deal for the deep dish; but it was doubly disappointing to get to the restaurant; find out they don't have deep dish; and then have to wait an hour for the thin crust (which was okay; but would never have made it on my short list to hit before leaving town).  All in all; it was a disappointing night for what has been one of my favorite Nashville spots. Big bummer.  TL; DR:  call before you go and ask whether the restaurant is still serving deep dish because apparently 312 sometimes runs out of the crust. [REVIEW_23] The blue version of Razoo; this is a bunch of sweaty tourists who will crowd and probably vomit on you.  Everytime i walk by the place; House of Pain is on:  ""Jump! Jump around! Jump! Jump around!"" [REVIEW_24] I am visiting from Chicago and stopped for dinner.  Food is VERY salty which any Thai cook will tell you is a big no no.  It is more Chinese style on stir fry's and they burned the fried rice.  Service very slow also. [REVIEW_25] I don't even know why I'm giving this one star . I didn't even actually get to eat anything. Upon arrival we were seated promptly. As we waited for somebody to come over and offer us drinks or anything for that matter 10 minutes had passed as we got up and left without being asked one question.  Great service good job guys. [REVIEW_26] I now remember why we don't order from this Pizza Hut anymore - a year ago; it took two and a half hours for the deliveryman to arrive; and we live three blocks away.  Today; we called to request an ETA an hour after delivery and were told the deliveryman would leave in five minutes.  Half an hour later; we called again and were put on hold twice.  When I said I'd been waiting an hour and a half; the person on the other end of the phone gave a sarcastic remark; so I told him to cancel the order.  The deliveryman showed up half an hour after that; and I turned him away.  I will definitely never order from this Pizza Hut again. [REVIEW_27] Just visited Station 52 today for lunch and was disappointed.  Food was mediocre at best. The nachos were a joke; the salsa is not fresh; all food seems to be frozen and reheated. They display specials on a blackboard as you enter but fail to mention they are only valid at the bar. Found this out once we received the bill. My wife ordered the Greek chicken pita which comes with fries and she asked to have old bay fries instead of standard fries. We get the bill and they charged us for a basket of old bay fries and when questioned why the charge for a basket; they said the Greek Pita came with chips but we didn't even get the chips.  The waitress then says ""oh I thought you wanted to sub fries for the chips"" then why did we get charged the full amount for the basket of fries; there should have been some discount if it was a sub. The waitress completely forgot my drink refill and brought it out with the check about 10-15 minutes after she took my glass. Overall very bad experience; won't be back. [REVIEW_28] Service sucks here around noon been waiting over an hour for a simple breakfast for 2. The food smells great if I could only damn well eat it. Like for real I've seen like 4 groups walk in order; eat and leave and we haven't got anything yet. [REVIEW_29] Rude staff. Food was subpar and greasy. I got a breakfast sandwich and it was greasy and soggy. Coffee was terrible and the espresso machine was out of service. [REVIEW_30] Terrible service. My friends and I waited at least a half hour for a drink. We were at the FRONT of the bar and were ignored time after time after time!!! We kept waving for the bar tender; however he seemed to be high on his horse and served everyone else but us. We were about to walk over to another bar when he finally asked what we wanted. I told him how long we had been waiting and that we kept waving him down. He disregarded our comment. We just walked away because I did not want to be served by this rude man. There is no place to sit unless you have a VIP table; which is terrible. I've been there twice since they have opened and have not had a good time there. Hire new staff that actually know what guest service is.",6
60,"[REVIEW_1] I'll put BCD up there with St Louis' best sandwiches.  Have been a fan since they opened; but don't get down nearly as much as I'd like.  Vince; the owner; is definitely putting his heart and soul into this place and it shows.  What I like best about BCD is that it is truly a neighborhood gem.  If you don't know it is there; you might miss it.  I think most people find it when they are looking for Hodak's Chicken (it is just down the street if coming from Gravois).  Anyway; I'm just echoing what everyone else has already said.  Awesome Sammies; awesome value; awesome music.  Can't wait for the annual summer block party!  Ask about the Blues City Dog...love that relish! [REVIEW_2] I cannot say enough how much I loved this place!! It has a great old school diner vibe. The workers there were so so nice. I had never had gumbo and they make it to order but they made us 2 little tasters; and I usually don't even like shrimp but I ate every last bite!!! We also had the grits; fried chicken and the split pea soup was the best freaking split pea soup I have ever had in my life and I am not kidding. And the prices are insanely affordable; between the 2 of us we ordered a lot of food and beers for only $25. Great deal! [REVIEW_3] Ive eaten there twice and both times it was terrible. Steak was salty; fish dry; my salad was frozen ; service awful. . Im really not sure how this place gets any good reviews. [REVIEW_4] Great spot for a birthday dinner! Try to get a table near the window. Sunset in August is typically around 8pm and the view is amazing. We ordered the lobster Mac and cheese; the duo beef entrée; and salmon. Delicious! For dessert we got the cheesecake which was very unique and not like anything else I have ever seen before. The chef also sent out delicious chocolates and praline treats! I lived it here and I can't wait to come back. Great service too; Antoine knew the menu very well and was highly professional. [REVIEW_5] FINALLY!! st. louis has a place at which i look forward to eating when i am visiting!!  i have been here twice and there is just no competition. the food is delicious; fresh; (dare i say?) even a little challenging! which we love. people reviewing here who didn't love the food are not adventurous. so; if you're not that type; try some place on the hill where you can drown your blown-out tastebuds in marinara or a nice mediocre alfredo sauce. the cocktails are perfect. everything we ate was perfect. and we left feeling sated but not overfed; as is often the case at places in the midwest. the last time we ate at here was the day after xmas; and we're STILL reminiscing. :) i love that they only accommodate groups of four or less. this really adds to the general charm of the place and speaks to the quality of the food. clearly; they're taking their time and making every dish perfect back in the kitchen; which you just cannot do when a table of eight tromps through. the dishes on the menu are made for sharing; and are the perfect size for 3 or 4 people; so it makes sense in this way too. it also means that the noise level is low.  it's such a refreshing break from all the other utterly characterless food in st. louis. [REVIEW_6] I got the iPhone X on Friday! So far so good. I was eligible for an upgrade and wanted to get some accessories.  I went in on Friday and purchased a phone case and the glass protector that covers in case I dropped the phone. I went the entire weekend with a phone case that I started to not like and I also applied the case on wrong the first time I did it. I went into this location and Matt was extremely helpful the moment I walked in! He greeted me; I explained what i needed and he did everything to make the experience smooth.   He spent a lot of time and patience applying my new screen protector and also assisted me with picking out a new case. I was surprised that it wasn't extremely busy when I first walked in but I also came in early in the morning! So definitely go when they first open if you can   :) [REVIEW_7] This place is outstanding. Best restaurant in Tampa! We ordered the Caribbean plate with Jamaican jerk; curry and stew chicken.  The chicken was the most tender and soft! The flavor was wonderful and unique. Delicious !! Service by Andre is top notch and he's attentive and genuinely cares about his customers! I highly recommend to all!!! [REVIEW_8] Everything was Amazing!! Ordered the Chelada and my husband ordered the Jalapeno Margarita which were both so flavorful. We shared the Appetizer platter that looked even better than online. This was an amazing assortment of Chicharrons; olives; cheese; Smoked Salmon; Pickled cauliflower; pickles; tortillas with agave....more more and more. So delicious!! We also ordered the Carne Asada which was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Our sides were the Brussel Sprouts and Street Corn. Everything was absolutely delicious and our Server was very friendly and helpful :) 10 out of 10 for me [REVIEW_9] Just moved to Nashville and was dreading finding a new vet that I loved and had reasonable prices.. With that said; we LOVE Dr. K! She is so personable and was really great with my dog; he was so comfortable the whole time. She also is very honest about pricing and tries the least expensive treatment first and discusses all the options with you! Would 100% recommend Parker's Paws! [REVIEW_10] I worked with the Sultans of Schlep last week on a small move within center city. I had a great experience for a number of reasons:  -Tom is extremely attentive; responsive; and easy to work with -They have fair prices -The movers were on time and worked efficiently -They provided wardrobe boxes at no extra cost -They have a cool and funny name (don't you think?)  I would definitely work with them again! [REVIEW_11] If you're from NY or north jersey then these bagels cannot compare to those bagels. Night and day. These bagels are huge tough dough balls. They are no better than what you'd get at a grocery store. If you're from around the area; then you'll find them ok; but they are nothing like a real NY bagel. [REVIEW_12] Had the worst experience at Dunkin Doughnuts [Apollo Beach]. One car besides myself in line. One customer inside. Had to wait a long time before they would take my order. [Same with the only other car in front of me.] ""You will have to wait."" came from the speaker. Several minutes later I said hello. Again;  ""You will have to wait; we are busy."" But; we were the only customers.. Wow.. Then came on the speaker; ""What do you want?"" Very rudely.. Wow.. When I reached the window; no customers inside. The staff acted like they were put out; having to serve a customer.  I'm hoping the person that was going to start-up a Bagel Shop will do so soon.. [REVIEW_13] Been here about 4 times so far and haven't had a bad meal yet. Awesome cocktails and friendly service. Being so new; they could use a bit more ambiance such as art on the walls but I suspect good things to come because the food is fantastic. We're excited to have this food option on the east side! [REVIEW_14] India Palace has saved my life several times; both due to its easily accessible location in the International Marketplace just off 65; and the fact that it opens for dinner starting at 5pm.  They also have FIFTEEN vegetarian entrees; plus a super delicious vegetable biryani.  Once seated you will be treated with water; menus; a basket of papadum; and an assortment of chutneys (mint; onion; and tamarind) which you will happily devour while deciding what to order.  What you should get: *GARLIC NAAN (if you don't try this without a very good reason; I will probably unfriend you) *Paneer chilli (delicious cheese cubes in a rich; spicy; tomato-based sauce - my favorite) *Nav ratan korma (veggies cooked with herbs; cashews; raisins - also fantastic) *Aloo mattar (peas and potatoes with a spicy sauce - my potato-loving husband's go-to dish)  The staff are very helpful and I've taken their advice on several occasions when I've been overwhelmed by the options - it's good advice.  Munch on! [REVIEW_15] There was no waiting line but still no one wanted to sit us even though many asked how many for dinner. Once sited no one came to our table. The restrooms were dirty and no toilet paper. Looked like it had not been cleaned in days. I would not recommend to anyone this location. [REVIEW_16] Love their food & Mimosas.  Appreciate the second location in Tucson.  Just be prepared for a bit of a wait during peak times. [REVIEW_17] My partner and I had a really great experience with Keswick Cycle. Super knowledgeable staff; really kind and helpful and very fair prices. We dragged 2 bikes out of my garage that had been in there for at least 5 years; and were able to get everything we needed to have them in great working order--two tunesups (one each) helmets; bike lights; and great locks; which they even helped us fit to our bikes and installed the holsters for the lights and locks free of charge. They fixed my broken chain; adjusted my kickstand; and aligned everything; fixed the tires; etc. They appraised the bikes so we'd know how much we can sell them for when we're done with them or when we move as long as they stay in good condition.  I highly recommend Keswick Cycle. [REVIEW_18] When this place first popped up on my phone as hot and new; I was so excited to try this place! It's always so exciting to try new cafes and ice cream places that pop in Reno since there really isn't many trendy places like these. It was interesting to see the cute wired sign and pink wall. The man at the register said him and his fiancé started this business so I wish them both luck! He was very welcoming very informative. The soft serve is so creamy-- the way it should be. The flavors are so yummy; it was nice to see familiar flavors like Ube and green tea. For some suggestions maybe a Thai tea or strawberry flavor? It was nice that we were offered pocky sticks to add to our krem creation. Maybe next time if adding wafer sticks or some type of cookies would be nice. I got the ube baby baby and it was delicious! I'll definitely be back for more! [REVIEW_19] Overpriced mediocrity.  Please don't waste your money here.  My family has eaten here twice and both times ""corporate"" has refunded the price of our meals because it has been so appalling.  This corporation/restaurant has no clue.  Please don't be ripped off. [REVIEW_20] Very great. The owner came and spoke with us. That is always a good sign. The waiter was great and the food outstanding. [REVIEW_21] I would say I am a pretty critical eater. Sweet potato pancakes are the best breakfast food I have ever tasted. Friendly staff with great stories. I feel like I had a cultural experience as well as great food that tells the story of the town history. Thank you Pancake Pantry! [REVIEW_22] This is just my first visit to M3 and we didn't eat only drinks at the bar.  But our bartender was fantastic with us. She made sure to pay attention to us and never let us sit without a full glass even though it was a busy Fri night and was quite busy. I have just moved to the area and happen to be barley a block away. I will be happy to review the food soon; I just got to get my butt in a chair there lol! [REVIEW_23] If you are looking for an awesome chiropractor and/or massage; this is THE pace to go.  Dr Welch is the best chiropractor I have ever been to! Seriously.  They make it so easy to make an appointment; and are always pleasant when I go in there.  Dusty is a great massage therapist as well :) Thanks for everything. I am a customer for life! [REVIEW_24] My hungover S/O and I thought breakfast at noon would help cure our brown bottle disease; and we were right! I had their french toast for breakfast (delicious); and bae ended up having one of the kids meals (scrambled eggs; bacon; and a single pancake). I always love going there; and would totally recommend them as being one of the good kind of greasy spoon breakfast places that exist in Broad Ripples heart. [REVIEW_25] I rarely leave reviews but this is my new fave place. Its not your typical greasy pizza place. They actually have some healthy options...and get this- the healthy options actually taste good. *gasp* I dined in when they were just 3 days old and the decor is eye-catching but not distracting. More importantly; the food is PHENOMENAL. I order takeout about once (sometimes twice...oops) a week. I have not had a bad meal yet. I'm working on trying different things on the menu but I have a few staples already- their hand cut Jersey fries; the mild wings; and the crust and fire bowl. I had their truffle burger last week and it was AMAZING. I've become a regular customer very quickly...I love this place. [REVIEW_26] Fantastic service; great food; and themed trivia every Thursday night; just make sure you reserve a table ahead of time they fill up fast [REVIEW_27] Prettay prettay pretty good.  Nice outdoor area and the craft beer is great.  Staff is nice. [REVIEW_28] I went here on a date night with my husband and or food was terrific;  the atmosphere was very nice.  Definitely will be going back [REVIEW_29] Find another pharmacy!  I have had bad experience after bad experience at this pharmacy.  First; they are incredibly slow.  There's often a long line of cars at the drive through window.  Even when there are no customers at the pharmacy counter inside; they seem to take a break between cars; making everyone wait for no reason whatsoever.  Recently; I went to pick up a prescription I have been taking for years.  After I paid; but before she handed me my medicine; the woman told me I had to wait and talk to the pharmacist.  I explained that I had the flu and that I had been taking that medication at that dosage for years and I really didn't want to wait for the pharmacist.  I just wanted to get home before I threw up again.  She told me it would be illegal for her to give me the medicine without talking to the pharmacist.  That is a bold faced lie.  It may violate Walgreens's policy; but it is not illegal.  Ask an attorney or any non-Walgreens pharmacy.  Finally; I was prescribed two medicines that cannot be taken together.  This Walgreens filled both prescriptions; repeatedly.  When I found out about the potentially deadly interaction between the two medicines; I pointed it out to the pharmacist very politely.  First; he had no idea those medicines were contraindicated.  Second; he acted like it was no big deal at all.  He never said sorry or we'll look into it or anything.  He just said something like; ""So you want me to take X medication off automatic refill?""  I was shocked.  I left a message for Walgreens to complain about that issue; but I never got a return call.  Time to find another pharmacy. [REVIEW_30] the employees were all nice and respectful to their customers. I rented out a two-people kayak for $30; and we were allowed to ride it for 3 hours; which is a pretty decent deal. I paddled the kayak around the port. it's a great place to kayak because there are areas where the waves are calm; and if you want; you can go out into the ocean and ride along the shores. I also saw seals just relaxing on a deck; which was a cool experience (wished i brought my phone to take pictures). Overall; it was a fun activity to do; especially during a warm sunny day :D",24
61,"[REVIEW_1] Great family restaurant feel. Po boys had the perfect bread. We had 3 different kinds and all were tasty. Mac 'n Cheese was good and a little spicy. Really fabulous service. [REVIEW_2] Worth every penny!  Had a bio lift facial with Magda and deep tissue massage with Colleen. In my opinion I could have gone with a regular facial and been amazed. The bio lift didn't do much for me. I am a convert and already have my next appt scheduled! [REVIEW_3] Erika is the sweetest waitress ever. Food is on par with a chain restuarant; but the staff makes it perfect. Thank you! [REVIEW_4] I can't speak for the food; but the drinks are great. What makes this little gem even more of a standout; are the employees. My boyfriend and I flew into for a quick weekend from Florida and this place was around the corner from our hotel. We were greeted  right away by John - one of the best bartenders I've ever had and had to pleasure of meeting. He made this place a standout. Kind; courteous and friendly. If we gained something more than a hangover from here; it was a friend I. Him. thanks for everything John!!!! You're the best!!! [REVIEW_5] This is sort of our secret place for lunch. It has great food; decent prices and the staff is friendly. It's a bit quiet when you walk in; but don't let that throw you off; the food is amazing. :) [REVIEW_6] Got an allen wrench stuck in my tire (how? I do not know). I like to support local businesses so I came to Main Street Tires. Some of the best and fastest service I have received. I was in and out with a fixed tire and spare removed within 15 minutes. It was also extremely affordable compared to what I was expecting. Would highly recommend. [REVIEW_7] Juliet was my lifesaver. I recently moved out of my last house in the suburbs and into a place in the city. I was completely lost in the move and had to start from scratch. Juliet helped me find everything. From doctors offices and referrals to organizing my apartment for the first time. She even helped find a vet for my cat and set up an appointment in less then five minutes from me asking.    Juliet is fast and prompt and even does her work with a warm smile. She knows the city like the back of her hand and can help you with any city needs. I highly recommend using her service. I know I'll be using her again! [REVIEW_8] This is one of my favorite local spots to visit.  Whenever I want to get out for a bit; grab a bite to eat or get some wings and a beer on football Sunday.  Oh; by the way; wings are half price on football Sundays which makes it even better.  There are drink and food specials daily.  The food is always good and you get it quickly.  Everything I have ever had has been really good; especially their grilled reuben.  When the weather is nice; you can go out on the patio which is nice because I'm an occasional smoker.  There's a bar out there and they even have a huge tv they roll out.  When it starts to get chilly; they fire up the portable propane heaters.  They are very accommodating and the staff and manager are all very nice.  Yea; I'm going back. [REVIEW_9] I've been getting Brazilian waxes from Vanessa for two years now; I followed her to Selah. No wax in that area is completely painless; but Vanessa is patient and professional while making you feel comfortable throughout the process. I have never had a bad result in waxes with her; and I've gotten brows; Brazilian; legs; and underarms done. The price is reasonable and so worth the quality of the service.   Selah is a beautiful shop and the ladies I encounter there are always friendly and welcoming. If you're going to spend the money on a wax service; there is no better place than Selah. [REVIEW_10] I absolutely love Legacy Salon and Spa. I have been going there since it was Sunday's at the Spa. Artie is an artist and has talked me into a fabulous very red asymmetrical cut that I adore! I get compliments from complete strangers all the time.    In addition I just had my first facial with Ingrid the new aesthetician and it was a relaxing joy. I have very sensitive skin and so am very cautious when it comes to trusting others not to turn me into a blotchy mess. Ingrid used her sensitive line and talked me through everything she was doing. I don't think I've been that relaxed in a long time and my skin is positively glowing!!! I highly recommend both Artie and Ingrid as fabulous at what they do and wonderful fun people!!! [REVIEW_11] Romantic; revolutionary; eclectic; chic. I can go on. The sad part is I only came in here for dessert and drinks! You want a cocktail do ya?! Well; you've stumbled on the right place. They have more or less a book full of choices to pick from. On this night; I wanted something of the red wine variety. They have wines from all over the world.   The sommelier leaves no stones unturned in terms of finding abstract wine to bring to the table. I finished my night with a glass of port accompanied by the the pie in a jar. A splendid combo that I had to pat myself on the back for. While I'm at it; I'll pat Olio on the back too. Bravo! [REVIEW_12] Just good old fashioned diner food. This is as real as it gets. Great prices matching great diner food. Sorry to the cali girl (review below); this is New Orleans. There are plenty of pretentious places you can go. This is not one of them. . Wonderful staff who make you feel like you have been coming for decades. Been 4 or 5 times and always loved it. Reminds me of a time when my Dad and I would go to his favorite ""spoon"" for breakfast after we cleaned my uncles bar. THAT'S THE SECRET; it reminds you of a time when things were simple and good service and food were the norm. Thank you to the owners and staff for serving more then just good food. [REVIEW_13] Great location. Great beer selection. You have many choices of beer on tap plus they have plenty of to go choices. No food here; but they usually have food trucks nearby. Enjoy a stroll on the green belt and stop by. [REVIEW_14] I ordered the shaved zucchini salad- it had a blue cheese yogurt; candied beets; pistachios (I think?) and some greens. Kind of small for $12; but it was good!  Also had the beausoleil oyster with chopped cucumber and some kind of mignette- delightful and you can buy them individually so you don't have to get a full order like many places!  The rose sour cocktail was right up my alley- slightly sweet and made with bubbles- how could I not like it?  We also ordered the sorghum bacon- thick cut like pork belly- sweet sauce! Yummy!   I really LOVE LOVE LOVE the decor and atmosphere here; eclectic industrial and slightly vintage- so super cute!    The menu changes quite frequently so be sure to check back often! [REVIEW_15] I walked in at 9:30 on a Tuesday and the owner told me they were closed. They need to change the hours online and lock the doors when they're closed. [REVIEW_16] I stopped here at my stop to Santa Barbara; coming down to LA from San Francisco. The food was amazing; and delicious. I would recommend anyone who like authentic Mexican food to stop and eat here. Good place. [REVIEW_17] Great spot! Buddy and I just visited. Awesome Dogs; great snap on the skin; great toppings. Fried had a very good seasoning; fresh lemonade. I highly recommend you go see Pauley; he is the man. Thank you for this gem! [REVIEW_18] The Eggs benny were slamming and the state st salad was supper.  Will be going back again [REVIEW_19] Fresh food; quality service; and inspiring decor. We walked in and were immediately greeted by the staff and made to feel at home. The paintings on the wall are colorful and fun. The food is prepared with love. The ginger tea is a must! [REVIEW_20] For the price; quality of the food; and the great staff and the chef/owner Kris Serviss you will be hard pressed to find another place like this. For those of you that don't know; earlier this year Serviss was named in Zagat's 30 under 30 for Philadelphia which is a really cool honor. He is definitely showcasing his talents at Blue Duck. We went on a Thursday night thinking around 6:30 pm thinking that we would beat the rush; we were wrong. We didn't make a reservation so we ended up waiting for a table for about 15 minutes. The whole time we were there people were waiting so it might be best to make a reservation in the future. After eating here I am can see why it's so busy; the food is outstanding and pretty much everything that can be made in house is from the burgers; the pasta; to the turkey meatballs. We went a little crazy on the food size and took some leftovers home but we started off with the grilled caesar salad which was awesome; especially the cornbread croutons. We also did the General Tso's wings which were huge and a full order is 12 for $11 and it comes with wasabi blue cheese which is awesome. For dinner we did the special pasta of the day which came with turkey meatballs; the pasta was awesome and you can definitely tell it's fresh and housemade and the same with the meatballs; they were crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. We also got the Pork Roll burger which is the one that won Serviss the Philly Burger competition and man it's awesome; some serious pork flavor there and the special sauce is great as well. Also got some Blue Duck Fries which are just gluttonous and amazing; fries tossed in duck fat; topped with confit duck; and then topped again with cheese sauce. We did somehow manage to save enough room for dessert which was cheesecake that came in a little jar. It was awesome as well; not overly heavy and rich; it was the perfect way to end the meal. So I have to say this place is a winner and I wish it was closer and I would recommend to anyone; but in the future we will be making reservations; at the counter; so we can hang with Serviss while he's cooking. [REVIEW_21] I hate the dentist... well; I should say I hated the dentist. I was nervous and anxious about going in to get a tooth fixed that had broke. I seriously waited until the last possible moment to go in and boy I'm glad I went here! Dr. Shawa is amazing; he was patient; kind and compassionate.  I've never met a dentist that was so awesome.  He helped me understand what to do differently to prevent cavities. He not only told me he showed me. He didn't harp on things I did wrong but things I can do in the future. The entire experience was exceptionally pleasant and his staff was great!   Not only am I not scared to go back; I can't wait to go back and fix the rest of my cavities once and for all! [REVIEW_22] When you need a glass of wine over lunch to relieve your hectic mid-week morning; this is great place to be.  Simple but well created dishes; and good recommendation for wine from the staff.   The chicken sandwich over chilled wine certainly helped me today. [REVIEW_23] I first used Sandys three years ago for my wedding dress. I had the arms let out because they were a bit snug.  Great job! I have also had a zipper fixed and and pants shortened. All turned out wonderful. No problems here! [REVIEW_24] I was just there last night. Awesome Italian restaurant. You are welcomed by the owner when you walk in who is very friendly and wants to ensure you are enjoying the meal and service. I can tell that the customer is extremely important to her and it shows as there is a decent wait; but it is worth it. This is my go to place for Italian food. Prices are reasonable and the plates plentiful. I typically get penne vodka with chicken. Their penne vodka sauce is second to none. What separates them from others is the apps are great; filling and just as much detail goes in the creation as their main dishes. Combine all this with BYOB and you can't go wrong. I never have room for dessert; maybe one day. If you want a consistent; reliable Italian restaurant this is it. [REVIEW_25] Great personal service . Clean environment and great working machines.  Plenty of room for folding clothes. Sandy was a great help when I forgot my hangers.  Thx.  Shout out to Deb also. [REVIEW_26] First time in Louisana and I was very happy. You can tell its good when the place is full of locals. I was already full after eatting the sampler! The fish was fresh and service was great. We didn't drive here but the parking situation was limited but I guess thats fine since there was still a wait. If you cant find parking....just know you will have to wait. Good experience. [REVIEW_27] The Filipiniana Philippine Café just had their soft opening yesterday and I couldn't have been more excited. It's great to see Filipino businesses opening around town like the PAO Truck; it makes the wait for PhilFest easier to bare and its fun having new exotic things to try.   The cafe sells bubble tea (boba); Halo-Halo (Filipino shaved ice drinks); Filipino coffee; Filipino baked goods; smoothies; and more. Things on the menu are fairly prices and the cafe itself has a modern feel to it.   I enjoyed a Halo-Halo Supreme yesterday ($5) and it was excellent. All the ingredients tasted fresh and my Filipino friends were definitely enjoying it as well (and coaching me on tips for mixing everything together for the best flavor). The Halo-Halo has flan in it which is awesome and shows the roots of Filipino cuisine in Spain.   We also tried the Ensaymada Ube Bread (~$3) which was excellent. It is a baked dessert that is stuffed with Ube (purple yam) which is perfectly sweetened. The bread itself was soft and enjoyable and could also pair well with some coffee.   The location is next to the original Saigon Deli on Waters and Dale Mabry behind the La Quinta hotel. It's hidden from the road so you should look for the Saigon Deli sign.   I'm excited for all these new businesses in Tampa and look forward to spending lots of time hanging out and enjoy Filipino sweets at the Filipiniana Philippine Café. [REVIEW_28] The food was great here. This is your typical Korean restaurant with authentic Korean food. Don't expect to be treated like you're in a high class restaurant. If you do; you are not in a typical Asian restaurant. Even so; these ladies/servers were trying their best to get us our food as fast as possible. We had the Korean BBQ for two with Bulgogi and Kalbi Ribs. It was well marinated and decent portions for two people. The side dishes were delicious! I will definitely recommend this place. It is very hard to find a great Korean restaurant in Nashville since it is so limited. [REVIEW_29] Um; how have I not written a review about this place yet??  I have dreams about their food!  Sweet; savory; delicious dreams...  The place is basically a gutted; old house; turned classic; tasteful restaurant.  It still has the feel of a house; like the comfort of walking into an old friend's house.  And the staff there is wonderful.  You are immediately greeted by a group of excited; smiling faces.  They all set the stage right away to let you know you've come to the right place.  After a decent (well-worth it) wait; we were seated near the awesome jazz band who played great music the ENTIRE time.  Seriously!  As if the atmosphere weren't enjoyable enough; I took one look at my menu and immediately wished I had another stomach.  I wanted it all.  Why can't I have it all??  Okay; so I chose a savory dish; and boyfriend got a sweet; sugary breakfast; and we both smiled with happiness over every bite.  Every doggone bite.  Yeah; I said doggone.  Did i mention the delicious array of juices and mimosas?  And word on the street is that they make a mean Bloody Mary.  Could this review be any more ADD??  No!  I didn't think so.  I'm just so excited about this place; I can't control it!  All I know; is that next time I'm going; I'm getting the Fish + Grits; and there's nothing you can do to stop me! [REVIEW_30] I stumbled on this for breakfast. I had a Backyard Bowl - yummy. The large is pretty big. The granola in it was fabulous crunchy but not overly sweet. It's great to find a restaurant that serves up organic foods. Tomorrow I'm going to try the Island bowl.  Pricing is about $6-7 but worth it --- better than eating pancakes.",29
62,[REVIEW_1] The cutest and definitely the friendliest coffee shop in Boise! The coffee is great but the staff is even better. Love this place! [REVIEW_2] Best food in town I eat here 3-4 times a wk . I never had a bad meal here [REVIEW_3] 1st time at Bagger daves in this area. I've always loved their burgers. They have a new one called crispy cheese bacon burger. Oh holy cow; that is one awesome explosion in your mouth. I think this is my all time favorite burger. I read many negative reviews about how long it takes to get your food. And I guess they listened and have improved . Our food came in a very respectable time. Also very good service and was seen to within minutes.  I give this place a two thumbs up. Oh and ask for extra napkins cause they are one juicy and messy hamburger.. [REVIEW_4] We can't wait to come back!  Okay so we decided to come to New Orleans for my 30th birthday and stay with The Ace. We asked for a few things to be in the room before we arrived and Oz at the front desk went so far above and beyond to make that happen for us. Literally what a star.   Allison and Cici helped us out during our stay as well and both are rock stars. Sadly; these are the only names I have but I can say that everyone was so nice to us and made our stay so wonderful.   The rooms are spacious and perfect for the vibe of the hotel. Great products in the bathroom; comfy beds and blackout curtains perfect for sleeping in. They're totally hooked up for music with a record player as well as an intuitive Bluetooth set up. Awesome minibar with all the fixings and a full fridge; which was great to have for all the leftover fried food you accumulate in Nola.   We didn't get a chance to eat at the restaurant; but it looks adorable. The lounge has super yummy cocktails and there is usually complimentary popcorn to snack on. Attached is a Stumptown Coffee which was so convenient for us as we head out to explore!   There's a rooftop pool and bar/restaurant called Alto that is so fun! Heads up; it is open to the public so it can get crowded. That said; we didn't have a hard time finding some chaises to set up on. The Eternal Summer was my favorite drink up here.   We actually made it to the gym. Once. It was great - clean towels; cold water; full set of weights and a couple treadmills. All good but we didn't spend much time here.   I think that covers it! Really looking forward to returning. [REVIEW_5] If you're looking for a glitzy restaurant chain with a bunch of simulated ethnic dishes; keep looking. This is the real deal. Only thing close I've found is in Miami. Had a Cuban sandwich. Picky wife had a turkey with cream cheese and strawberry preserves. Sounds weird but excellent. The best I've had North of Dade county. Gonna be a regular stop when in Indy. Gotta like it when the cook comes out and asks how you liked it.   The unknown diner digs it! [REVIEW_6] This is my first choice whenever we decide to go out to dinner! They have a huge selection of foods that will fit any type of person who will be dining there. Their staff is super nice and will accommodate to whatever your needs may be! The restaurant itself is beautiful and very relaxing. In my opinion; Fellinis of media has the best Italian cuisine around. [REVIEW_7] So glad I finally listened to my boyfriend.... this place hands down has the most delicious and amazing shrimp po boy I've had in the entire state of Florida.  Definitely recommend!!!! You will not be disappointed [REVIEW_8] It's been quite some time since I first reviewed New Day Meadery; and I can honestly say the experience here is the same if not better than even a few years ago. Brett and Tia are possibly the coolest entrepreneurial couple I know; and the pride in their craft certainly shows in the product.  We recently hit up their anniversary bottle release of gin barrel-aged Shelby Blue Ribbon; for which my wife and I were first in line. Naturally we purchased the maximum amount of bottles of this special elixir; as I believe it was approximately 3 years ago when this was last available.  New Day is truly one of the cornerstones of Fountain Square; and if you haven't stopped there yet; you haven't fully experienced Fountain Square. [REVIEW_9] this was so worth it.  first; what an awesome innovation - the mini-scoop sampler!  i can never decide what to get; and this time i got to choose FOUR flavors!  i got the chocolate; lavendar honey; coffee butter pecan; and the pumpkin cheesecake.  the butter pecan was in a league of its own; but closely followed by the honey.  not only were these flavorful; but all four were perfectly dense creaminess.  it's a good thing i don't leave near the place. [REVIEW_10] Kanella carries a well-deserved reputation as a prime brunch spot in Philly. Luck smiled on my party of three; as we snagged a last-minute reservation at noon (you should plan further in advance than we did). I echo other reviewers' sentiments concerning the decor at Kanella; as I walked in; the antique exposed brick and blue/white color scheme tempoarily transported me back to the Cycladic Islands. Chef Pitsillides kept the illusion going with his typically Mediterranean hospitality. He checked on our table thrice to make sure we felt welcomed; and indeed the constant attention and care we received has earned Kanella a return visit on that merit alone.  That isn't to downplay his Cypriot fare; the food is absolutely delicious. One can only indulge in so many variations of french toast or eggs benedict before growing bored; and Kanella's vibrant; rustic plates certainly enliven the palette and restore one's faith in brunch. We commenced our meal with the obligatory dip trio; which served up pumpkin-feta; spicy tomato; and white bean dips in lieu of the stereotypical hummus and baba. Each scored high marks from the table; with the pumpkin cruising into first with an interesting briny-earthy-sweet interplay.   Other dishes ordered included the baked duck egg; potatoes with tzatziki; and a special lamb tongue stew. Though small in portion; the duck egg showed deft execution with a crispy but ever-so-slightly-creamy fried egg crowning well-seasoned; toothsome greens in yogurt sauce. The potatoes had a similarly crisp texture with fluffy innards; and paired beautifully with accompanying minty; rich tzatziki. The tongue stew offered a heaping plate of creamy giant beans and tender; pleasantly funky lamb tongue pieces in a vibrantly flavored sauce. With a squeeze of lemon juice; a dollop of accompanying Greek yogurt; and a last-minute side order of extra grilled pita; the dish served as a hearty; memorable combination of flavors and textures.  For a change of pace in the Philly dining scene; or simply for Chef Pitsillides welcoming demeanor and crazy-good plates; head to Kanella and get whisked away to the Aegean for an hour or so. [REVIEW_11] Cool little place that has amazing cookie dough! It tastes just like real cookie dough; but is made without eggs or dairy (chocolate chips technically are handled with dairy). They'll let you try whatever you want so have at it until you find what you like. 1 scoop is more than enough. You can get it in a cone or a cup just like ice cream! It stays if you need to take it home for later or the next day! Love it! Staff is super welcoming and will tell you all about the flavors and process if you have questions! [REVIEW_12] Restaurant has an excellent service; good tasting food; for someone on a rush; or someone looking to have a vegan experience.. I Totally recommended. [REVIEW_13] Though top notch service is demanded at a JW; I was thoroughly impressed with the property; service; and staff.   I only had two complaints. One was the noise level as there was an outdoor concert until 11pm. The other was the below average bartender at velocity during lunch. Nothing terrible; but lacked enthusiasm and desire to give good service. Obviously the concert wasn't the hotel's fault. The bartender issue wasn't worth dropping the rating a star.   Overall; the GM of the hotel seems as though he/she has it together. Thanks to all the staff for a nice stay. [REVIEW_14] Super! In every way. Just attended the Blueberry Festival. Had a special steak sandwich and blueberry tart. Home made chips. Excellent and service rarely seen. Thanks! [REVIEW_15] Awesome detailing job. My car was DIRTY. Hadn't washed it in months. Got the executive detailing option now look at me. [REVIEW_16] I had my condo tented a few weeks ago. We came home 2 days later to find dog poop was shoved in the cracks of the floor rocks in the back yard. The whole back yard smelled horrible!!  We collect our dog poop for a week and put it in a bucket until trash day; we also add a little dirt to the bucket to keep the smell down. We forgot to through it out before the tenting and left the full bucket in the yard.   I called Jhonny's and asked for someone to come out and explain why they did this and clean it up. Two days later someone came over to look at it. They didn't bother cleaning it up and they lied; saying they got dirt from the ground and not the bucket. I told Jhonny's employee it was to much of a coincidence that the bucket of poop was entirely empty and the area where they had to add dirt smelled of poop. The employee continued to lie about where he got the dirt from; but agreed to have someone come by the following Monday and/or someone from there office would call me to set up an appt.  As of today no one called; no one showed up. [REVIEW_17] I have used the Monster Minders daily dog walking service for almost 6 months now and have been 100% satisfied!  Carrie and Lindsay instantly connected with my dog Brooklyn during the meet-and-greet.  They keep a detailed file w/ his information on hand & have a handy online booking/payment site.   Brooklyn LOVES Lindsay his first minder and is equally infatuated with his current minder Stephanie.  I was recently home sick when Stephanie came to take Brooklyn for his walk.  To no surprise; Brooklyn was delighted to see Stephanie come into the apartment!  His tail wagged the entire time she was suiting him up to go out.  After the walk he was relaxed; calm and ready for a nap.  There are many dogs in my building; with many walking services; but the concierges in my building constantly comment on how caring and sweet Stephanie and Lindsay have been with Brooklyn.    The Monster MInders are a dog-loving; trustworthy; professional and highly recommended group of people. [REVIEW_18] Absolutely delicious foods!! Hard to find a vegan restaurant in the area and this was definitely an amazing find. People who worked there were so friendly and knew what they were talking about when it came to answering questions relating to the foods offered.   The presentations of the food too were beautiful and a good Sized portion as well. We went for brunch; am looking forward to going back sometime for lunch/dinner! [REVIEW_19] Wow!  Very friendly staff!  The clam chowder was wonderful and so were the crab cakes [REVIEW_20] Just love the grits; can't find these anywhere else in Reno-Sparks.  Spinach Mozzarella; pepper jack!  Yumm  Good tri-tip- not chewy and BBQ chicken in either a sandwich or wrap.  Super nice folks too. True family operation. [REVIEW_21] Love love love! This place!!!  We were in town visiting for my birthday weekend and winded up here after a wasted experience at Warm Daddys. There are so many good things to say I will break it down.  LOCATION: this place shares a parking lot with Longhorn Steakhouse so there are plenty of spaces. Its also near a best buy; etc so should you have to wait you can shop around. Although we didnt wait at all  LAYOUT: Being from baltimore; we wanted to watch the 1pm game a/g Pittsburgh. The Eagles game was at 4pm. There were PLENTY tvs all around to watch ANY football game you wanted. There are plenty of seats all of which you can view the TVs if you wanted with a bar area in the middle of the floor as well.  ATMOSPHERE: family friendly and clean! I especially liked the fact that during commericals for the main game; they played music and as soon as the game came back on the music stopped. This is atypical of some places; as they play music the whole time and you only can read the close captioning while watching the game.  DRINKS: Drink menus are very important to me. I like variety and boy did this place had it. They had various drink concoctions they put together that seemed very interesting! I had two of their different drinks and was not disappointed by either of them.  DESSERTS: Delish!!! My friend got the mile-high cake and wow!!! This stands at least 6 inches high with about 6 layers. For only $8; this fed the whole table!  APPETIZERS: DO NOT leave there without trying the crab bread; and that says alot for someone coming from Baltimore. There's also this special dipping sauce that comes with it? Exquisite!! I couldnt get enough. The spinach/artichoke appetizer was definitely a treat as well.  ENTREES: the fajitas are to die for; i had the cajun shrimp pasta which was good. The salmon was bland; but the bbq chicken sandwiches were great! A friend had grilled chicken greek salad and the chicken was plentiful.  Also for you health food nuts; all the nutritional facts are posted for EVERYTHING; even the drinks.  Next time I go back to Philly; i will be coming back. [REVIEW_22] We ate here for supper based on the reviews. I got the stuffed flounder which was delicious.  My husband got the feast which was crab legs; shrimp; and mussels. It was also flavorful and yummy. As a bonus kids eat free on Tuesdays. We also had wonderful service. [REVIEW_23] Exactly as bougie and casual at the same time as you need it to be. Come with your Gucci bag or in your yoga pants and slam a delicious cocktail or three. [REVIEW_24] I must admit; I wasn't expecting much. This place totally blew us away. This has to be one of the best Indian restaurants in the Tampa Bay. The ambience is wonderful including white table linens. The best part was the food; OMG. The chicken 65 was to die for; and the hot sour soup was rich and flavorful. The waitress (Angel) was friendly;  attentive and very pleasant. They opened just a week ago. I'm sure this will soon be the place foodies seek out for real Indian food. [REVIEW_25] It's a little expensive. However; I had to give it 5 stars because it's the most painless wax I have ever had...their wax is amazing. [REVIEW_26] Great food. Great atmosphere. The decor is really nice. Modern and cozy. I had lasagna and it was one of the best lasagna I've ever had. Hubby had risotto loved it as well. Service was good. [REVIEW_27] Recently moved away from St. Louis and I miss this place. The atmosphere is very interesting and unique; first of all. The decor is pretty unusual and it's fun to sit on the balcony. The food is great and all locally sourced and homemade; even their ice cream. And really; if you go; you have to try the ice cream. My favorite thing to order is the Rumchata milkshake; which is made from Rumchata and their homemade cinnamon ice cream. [REVIEW_28] Happened upon this place (visiting family from out of town) and were happy to get a quick and yummy bite before heading to meet up with family. It's a small little place with a lot of classic Italian dishes; some sandwiches and St. Louis-style pizza options. My husband and I split a sandwich and got Italian wedding soup to go with it!   The lady at the counter was super nice and friendly. Would definitely recommend stopping in!   Parking is in the lot and sandwiches are about $10. There are $10 lunch specials too. [REVIEW_29] Aw; man. I was hoping I'd previously posted a glowing review of RuSan's so I could prove that once upon a time; I liked it here. But; I didn't so just trust me on this one.  It is with a heavy heart that I relay today's experience over the lunch sushi buffet. Cold; gelatinous; and ~$11/each. It's been a year or three but I remember this being so much better. Don't get me wrong... I love cheap; fast food-ish; ethnic cuisine and I have lovely memories of the Ginger Simmered Beef; Fried Garlic and Bay Shrimp Salad Maki (like I said; once upon a time); but today? Lackluster is an overstatement.  With each bite; I kept hoping the next would be better. But; alas. It wasn't.   Why; RuSan's? With all your new neighboring restauranteurs in The Gulch; is this the taste of complacency? I shake my head in disappointment because I know your potential and cherish what we once had.   On the upside; my water was refreshing and the service was fine. [REVIEW_30] We've gone to several different vets at Kirkwood Animal Hospital over the years and you honestly can't go wrong.  We currently see Dr. Hormuth and couldn't give a more glowing recommendation; she loves our dog and he loves her.  To put it in to perspective: My dog; Cooper; legitimately gets excited if I say we're going to the vet.,28
63,"[REVIEW_1] If you're looking for a great brunch place in New Orleans; definitely come here!  My boyfriend and I had brunch here on Sunday; and we loved it! We both started with the Brandy Milk Punch; which was divine.  If you are of age; order this drink!  It is an alcoholic milkshake; and I could literally go here just to drink that because it is so good.    They bring out fresh bread and butter; and then my boyfriend and I ordered the trio of appetizers.  The trio is quite small; but it includes a duck springroll; fried chicken livers and a fried oyster.  The duck springroll came with a wonderful tangy sauce; which I greatly enjoyed.  My boyfriend enjoyed the fried chicken livers and the fried oyster; but those are not two of my favorite things.  For my entree; I ordered the shrimp and grits.  Oh my goodness... so good! The shrimp are bacon-wrapped; and the grits are true Southern grits.  I will definitely order this dish again when I get the chance to return.  My boyfriend ordered the fish of the day; which was blackened Mahi Mahi; and he loved it.    Definitely go to Mr. B's! [REVIEW_2] Best hotel/casino in Reno. The rooms are really nice; whether in the Peppermill tower or the Tuscany tower. The Tuscany side is REALLY nice; Big; nicely decorated rooms and  huge bathrooms with TVs and showers big enough for two. All of the Peppermill restaurants are above average with Biscotti's being my favorite. Even their room service delivers great food in a very timely manner even when they're busy. The rooms and the casino are very clean. The best part is their employees. They're ALWAYS very accommodating; helpful; and seem to really care about the guests. Everyone from the valets to the bell desk to the reservations desk and people working in the casino seem very willing to help with whatever is needed. I've stayed in other Reno hotels and none can even come close to the overall quality of the Peppermill.  I never win on the slots but I always have a lot of fun! [REVIEW_3] One of the best donuts I've ever had. The dough is perfect & the icing is not so sweet it cuts your teeth. [REVIEW_4] We had to go to Costco to buy a new TV. We wanted to avoid driving 465 (coming from Bloomington) so we decided to go to this location instead of Castleton. We were sort of dreading going on a Saturday afternoon; thinking it would be a madhouse from the parking lot to the check out line. Boy; were we wrong. The Greenwood Costco is the most mellow; low key; Costco I have ever visited.   Seriously; we were blown away. Plenty of parking. Not crowded. Nice people working there. Lines not too long at check out. Clean!   I have been to Costco locations from California to Indiana and this is my new go-to location. Have been visiting the Costco in Castleton but this location is so much nicer. (only wish that there was a Trader Joe's nearby)  Another cool thing; this location has so much more Indian food than any other Costco I have been to. I assume it's due to a larger population of Indian people in the area.   We asked the cashier why it was so mellow there and she said ""I think it's because we are so new"" but honestly; I would think that would be a reason for them to be crazy busy there. Regardless of the reason; it was the best Costco experience I have ever had. [REVIEW_5] What else is there to say about 3 Muses?  Creative; reasonably priced food by one of my local favorites; Chef Dan Esses; fun; laid back atmosphere; clean (not something often said about bars on Frenchmen); great music but not intrusive; really good cocktails and an eclectic ; well priced wine list.  Definitely worth checking out! [REVIEW_6] I love this place!  The side dishes come out fast; and they are very fresh.  The service is good too.  For the amount of food you get; you can't beat the price.  $10 for the most yummy tofu stew. [REVIEW_7] The donuts are amazing but you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't order something with the praline bacon. The egg; bacon biscuit is as delicious as it is instagram worthy. The coffee holds its own too. District Donuts was the highlight of our visit so far. [REVIEW_8] Thank you Yelp for another good find. A great choice when in town. Just behind Busch Gardens; being from out of town I may have been skeptical being off the beaten path and not the best neighborhood. Don't let that hold you back. Went with my kids and glad we did. The service is very friendly and professional. Must be the owners; they take pride in their business and it shows. Food was delicious; perfectly prepared and presented. [REVIEW_9] We stayed a night for a ""special occasion"" over the weekend. We were able to walk from our canal-side apt; mostly because we didn't want to pay the $28 garage fee. There are plenty of valets out front; someone to open the doors for you and any check in agents not busy at their station wait in front of the counter to greet you and bring you to their station.  Check in was easy and quick and the agent was very kind. After answering all my questions about check out times; restaurant hours; and fitness center and pool locations; she took me directly to the elevators. She proudly stated that there were 2 sets of elevators; with the high rise lifts being the ""fastest in the midwest"".  Between the concierge and elevators is the Lobby Lounge with a couple tall fire n ice type fireplaces and lots of comfy looking couches; tables; and bar tables. The lounge menu looks interesting and they even have a Soju cocktail! (that's a Korean rice liquor drink.) Specialty cocktails are $9. We had requested a high level room and we got the 28th (out of 33) floor with a big picture window view over the end of the canal and the White River. We had a standard double bed with oh so comfy bed linens; a work desk with a cordless phone; flat screen Samsung TV and coffee maker. The shower had a large glass door and a rain type shower head as well as 2 smaller adjustable heads below it. Fun but you can't turn all the heads on at the same time.  We were very nicely greeted with a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries after we returned from dinner; which we finished off in our bathrobes.  There is an iPod docking stereo which we couldn't get to work; but we could hear directly from the iPhone pretty well anyway.  The hotel and rooms are clean with a Vegas like feel. We looked around the fitness center; which is quite large and has lots of machine and small semiprivate areas for yoga/pilates/bosu. The indoor pool looked pretty small. Our room came with free breakfast at Osteria Pronto which has a sizable buffet for only $16. It would be a very nice stay in Indy for out of towners and I'd return to the bar and restaurant as a local.  I actually like the look of the building and think it makes downtown look more modern. Great location close to museums; connected to the convention center; and close to the mall and canal. [REVIEW_10] Couldn't have asked to work with a better painting company!  We decided to put our rental property up for sale; after speaking to the realtor we decided to hire someone to paint the house.   We had Pamella & Sameh arrive to our property to do the estimate; they were both so friendly and were great about educating us on why certain things were important and explained their process and why they choose to do things the way they do. We learnt so much (which help when we had another company quote the same job).   After getting a few quotes; we decided to work with Blue Nile; they did a great job; were clean and respectful of the space and our timeline (they were finished earlier then expected). They filled in all the holes and dings from 8 years of renters... this wasn't a small task and they did a great job; leaving us able to do more.   Once they were done; we did a walk through with them and then they asked us to review the work and let them know if anything thing needed touchup; they'd be happy to come back to fix them. We found one small spot that we thought could us a touch up; they were there promptly and were genuinely happy to do the work to our expectations.   The house sold within 5 days of being on the market. [REVIEW_11] This shop is a slice of Disney beauty and magic hiding on the edge of Broad Ripple; and a MUST stop of sweets; treats; and dreaminess. Your Instagram needs this place. Hands down the ~best~ red velvet cake of my life.  Appearance: The Cake Bake Shop is a beautifully decorated; small white house with a captivating design. The flowers around the sign make it an #instaworthy post for sure; and when the weather is nice; the outdoor seating must be gorgeous.  Inside the Cake Shop will take your breath away; light airy colors and flowers and twinkling lights. This isn't the kind of cake shop you do take-out at; you'll want to sit and enjoy.   Food: I wanted to try the Raspberry Champagne cake; unfortunately one wouldn't be ready for a little while; so I ordered a slice of the Red Velvet  Cake. The floral icing work was so perfect I didn't want to touch it; but I had to because come on it's cake. What I assume must have been cream cheese filling in the middle was decadent and I never wanted the cake to end. ***I felt one slice was plenty for two people; it's HUGE  I was torn between the Rose Cappuccino and the Lavender Latte. I went with the Lavender Latte; hot; and it was stunning; it was a creamy; smooth; not-at-all bitter latte and the hint of lavender was enough to taste but not over powering; it was probably the most perfect coffee I've ever had in my life.   Price: the coffee is pricy; $6; so not a regular coffee stop for me; but for #treatyoself it's the way to go. The slice of cake was $12 but like I mentioned; it was enough for two people and for how amazing it was; I think it's so worth it.  Customer Service: I mentioned Disney initially because the friendliness; care; and attention of the staff felt just like Disney. They were kind; they helped me decide what to try; and the barista even offered to make me the rose cappuccino if I didn't like the lavender latte after trying it - how sweet!   I will most definitely think to come here if anyone visits and wants something sweet. This place has my heart and is a hidden gem to anyone who has a sweet tooth!  Check out my #FirstTimeFriday highlight of my visit to The Cake Bake Shop on my Instagram @jordanqjordanq for pictures of everything mentioned above! [REVIEW_12] I am in love with this place! ! A charmingly friendly and helpful staff. Incredibly diverse excellent spread for breakfast. Chocolate covered strawberries as a treat in the room. Great location across from Redding Terminal.  Great happy hour in the hotel bar!! [REVIEW_13] I dig Chinatown in Philly. It has always been a uniquely cool place for myself since my college days. Chinatown is an overload for the senses; from the smells; the tastes; the scenery and the hustle and bustle.  Chinatown Philly is a must stop when visiting Philadelphia. The location is very close to Old City and the historic areas.  The choices of different Pan Asian cuisines in a concentrated area are outstanding and varied. Chinatown is also evolving; there are new younger and hipper places juxtaposed with the old and classic Chinatown establishments.  My personal favorites are Dim Sum Garden; Nan Zhou Hand Drawn Noodle House; Rangoon and Terwakawa Ramen. There is also a new food court on Race Street called Chinatown Square. I have not tried this yet; but it looks very nice with a decent array of food options. For desserts there are several bubble tea and rolled ice cream shops plus A La Mouse; a Japanese-French style café. There are even several hair salons that have late hours and reasonable prices.  Anything is possible is Chinatown; at least food wise. [REVIEW_14] I don't go there often; but when I do I get the Fox Treat.  Best to go at odd times to avoid the lines. [REVIEW_15] I legit just walked into Blaze being 9pm and as soon as I got to the line I was told that they are closed. I'm not sure if this is correct as the hours online and on the front door states that they are open until 10pm daily. I also checked the website before coming into Blaze. This pizzeria is new to the area so I was actually pretty stoked to check them out and unfortunately my first experience is not what I expected. It would have been courteous for them to give me an explanation for their time change on a Tuesday night. [REVIEW_16] My family recently purchased a 2015 Mazda CX-5 from this dealership.  They had a large selection; and after looking over quite a few we made our choice.  The price was within our predetermined range; and the sales staff were not pushy at all.  We looked at other small SUVs; or Crossovers as they are called; around Reno and felt there was very little difference in the various makes.  We decided on the Mazda because of the Dolan's family's history of giving back to the community.  We couldn't be more pleased with the vehicle. [REVIEW_17] My husband needed to have his rear windows repaired due to a bad tint job at a different location. Tyson was extremely professional and did a great job. We would definitely take our vehicles back if we needed too. Thanks Tyson! [REVIEW_18] Nataly N continued to amaze me for my birthday weekend with another surprise dinner.  This time; we dined alone ;)  Aldine had been on my to-try nearly since it opened.  They offer three courses; plus dessert; and drinks via their a la carte menu.  As I've always preferred a variety of food versus a huge portion of one dish when dining out; their type of menu plays to my preferences.    We each began with a cocktail and first.  I cannot recall the name of my cocktail; but you'll know it as the one with tequila; watermelon; and a chilli pepper spice.  The spice was not overpowering; but did help ensure I didn't down the drink in one go!  As for our firsts; we shared the beets and corn + truffle custard.  The beet salad came with a cashew butter that helped balance the ingredients.  The custard appeared simple and straight forward; but after tasting I realized it had 'a lot going on' with bits of mushroom and tomato.  Instead of each ordering a second; we split the heirloom tomato.  Like the previous salad; it was well assembled and presented.  I could share more notes; but it went down so quickly!  We ended the savory dishes by sharing the culotte steak and pork coppa.  I was surprised just how well the blueberry paired with the pork and black garlic chips that came with the steak ensure each bite was excellent.  No worries about temperature as they were both cooked perfectly.  We ended the night with dessert; including a well place candle arranged by Nataly N.  Their olive oil cake was rather simple but nonetheless delicious.  The panna cotta was smooth and very easy to enjoy.  To round out my review; I can touch on service and atmosphere.  It was easy to say service was amazing.  Prompt coverage without interrupting our alone time.  Greeting smiles with great recommendations. On atmosphere; yes the dining area was very basic.  However; it was also very bright and filled with natural light as we dined just before sundown.  I feel it helped us be ourselves and feel comfortable while enjoying our fine dining we didn't need to lift a finger to prepare... [REVIEW_19] Great service every time come here. Food was delicious and drinks always good. Dave was our server and has been our bartender.  Love coming here! [REVIEW_20] All the crepes I've tried are fantastic. The coffee is very good; though I wish they had larger sizes available. Looks tiny from the outside there is comfortable seating in the basement. [REVIEW_21] Actually gabbed a cheesesteak from next door and a drink from Marmont and sat at there outside tables.  Service was excellent and the drinks were great. [REVIEW_22] The crappy Indiana roads blew one of my tires on my CTS on I465N. I was able to drive to them and they changd my tire at 11 pm at night in no time!! Thanks Guys!! [REVIEW_23] Gave this place another chance and definitely seems as though management has been working to improve it and it really shows. It's really great when management takes people opinions and critics and works to improve them. Well done!!! [REVIEW_24] Ordered the Classic Margarita pizza and it was fantastic!  This place has the best crust and cheese!  The employee who took our order was very kind and the service was pretty quick.  Will definitely be stopping by again the next time I am back in Santa Barbara. [REVIEW_25] I had my Co worker pick up a to go order. The food was all fabulous.  I thought it was pricey until I saw the quality and amount of food that you get! The coleslaw is unique and delicious! If you haven't tried this place; go! I can't wait to try the cajun meatloaf; available after 5 p.m. Great job Jungle Prada Tavern Team! I will be back! [REVIEW_26] My god is this place ever wonderful! Such a huge selection delicious teas! The sales people are also very friendly; and it seems they really enjoy their job. They will literally let you smell absolutely every tea. My favourites are Chocolate Rocket; Swampwater; Tropicalia; and Goji Pop. You can buy tins of loose tea; and these will generally last you a long while. They also carry wonderful tea accessories; teacups; teapots; mesh balls; natural sweeteners; infusers; the works. Definitely try DavidsTea; you won't regret it! [REVIEW_27] Very helpful staff and a ton of awesome shoes!! So much stuff that is hard to find. Dope spot! [REVIEW_28] So much care is given to healthy; delicious food (ex. Japanese squash rather than white potatoes in curry). Thay have nice touches like a welcome snack and straw wrappers twisted in a rose. The sauces are amazing; menu has so many options; they accomodate special dietary needs easily since everything is made from scratch; even the desserts have that extra touch using both white and black sticky rice. This is our go-to for Thai from now on! [REVIEW_29] The interior design is impeccable; the staff is friendly and the food is spot on.   If you want to try something special; more than just your average wings; try the sauce and toss special. You won't be disappointed.   I'll be living nearby and will probably come back to try the other areas of the menu. Well done! [REVIEW_30] We tried Lamb kabobs and chicken vindaloo tonight and were very happy with both. We love hole in the wall places! This one fits the bill; too. It's primarily take out inside a convenience store. The proprietor told us about the lunch special which offers a variety of food so you can find your favorite. We are going back for fresh chili chicken tomorrow! I suggest if you like it spicy; ask for it. The food was delicious and flavorful; but not spicy enough for our palates.",29
64,"[REVIEW_1] Food is good; but don't try to ever call in for takeout.  Every time they put you on hold and don't come back. [REVIEW_2] Horrible horrible!!! Got a flat tire.. took them 3 hours to send somebody!! I know the flat tire happens but 3 hours??!! When I was only 20 min from the rental car center... I will never use them again.. I travel every week and thought I would give them a try.. [REVIEW_3] Had the chicken and French toast and it was over the top! While it would do some good to have more shade on the patio it was still an enjoyable experience. They are pet friendly too! We will be back! [REVIEW_4] The Paris Hair Salon is a warm; friendly inviting personal experience with people who really know hair. I have thick unruly hair and many don't take the time to carefully go through it. Paris Hair takes the time and makes it right; I am so pleased; and the price is right too. Cut; color and hilites all perfect; every time! -Maureen Kerfoot [REVIEW_5] Terrible; just terrible!  They need to tear this place down immediately.  I remember going here in the 80's for decent pizza & to a movie; but time has passed this place buy.  I went into Kmart to look for backpacks just a week ago and even that was a bad experience.  All there stuff looked old and outdated.   Why don't they turn this place into a Target; its practically empty anyway.  Either the stores have gone out of business for lack of shoppers or wisely moved elsewhere.  Sorry to see this location die a slow death; but its no more than an eye sore now. [REVIEW_6] I would give it zero stars if I could; but yelp obviously doesn't like that. First; if you want to call this dealership the operator acts like the secretary of the CEO; and doesn't want to connect you to talk to anyone. Then she gives you a lecture about how things are handled. She finally connected me; after telling her she can keep the car if this call doesn't get anywhere very soon. Working with Lance was a pleasure. When it came to pick up the car we were informed that due to internal commission problems we would have to receive the car from Tony now as he was the first point of contact even though he wasn't at work or had any part in the deal at any time. Turned out he didn't even know what car we bought. When voicing my displeasure about having to work with someone else; John Hartman; the assistant general manager; just gave a rude answer asking what car we were picking up. Dealing with Crown GMC was a pleasure in the past; but with Hyundai not so much; yet the price made me not walk away at this point. I can only suggest to take your business elsewhere if you expect to be treated with respect. After signing all the paperwork the promised navigation turned out to be non existent. [REVIEW_7] I went there once years ago I believe I cut my order down when the employee went from picking up trash to picking up my bagels No glove; not even paper.. I don;t recall all the details; but my immediate thought was it's another establishment that has no concept of hygiene and exploits the lack of oversight..To top it off; the bagels were far from fresh Needless to say; I haven't been back But I realize many people don't care about cleanliness. If that's you; you'll enjoy this place. [REVIEW_8] If you order the same type of meals they will make a meal for one and split the amount of meat with the 2nd platter. Yes they always short you out of your meat. Why the heck did we only have one strip of grilled chicken for each wrap. This is not the first time this happened either. Don't even bother to tip them because you will still be hungry and will have to eat again to satisfy your stomach.       When we all order separate meals or separate types of meals; we get the correct amount of meat and fries. Idiots [REVIEW_9] the store is adorable! I was extremely impressed with the fantastic customer service I received from the very nice woman working there today. she immediately offered samples of the chicken salad and cinnamon rolls which were out of this world! I was only passing by but before I knew it I bought pies (yes in plural form) chicken salad; and their fresh white bread. 5 stars! [REVIEW_10] I love coming here! Food is great and the service is what I'd expect coming to an lower-end Indian restaurant. The portions are so large I always have enough for 2-3 meals after! [REVIEW_11] Three Dog Night had a popular song that hit number 1 on the charts in the 70's. It was appropriately called ""One"". In the lyrics; it stated; ""One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do"". That may be true in love; but when it comes to dining sometimes you just want to dine alone.  If you do; avoid HWK.   Not once; but twice I have been turned  away when wanting to dine here as a single person. The first time when I called to make a reservation; the young lady who answered informed me they preferred not to sit single diners at tables and that I'd have to eat at the bar.  At first I was content with that arrangement; but then she continued to tell me that  those eating at the bar can not select from the entire menu. At that point; I decided not to make the reservation.  I wanted the true HWK experience. After all the reviews have been amazing.   The second time; I stopped in for early lunch while shopping the main drag in Maplewood.  Once again; I was told I'd have to sit at the bar and order from a ""limited menu"". When I asked if I could be seated at one of the hightops in the window; she told me she needed to save those for parties of two. The kicker came when I asked if they were already reserved and she said; ""no"".  I ate else where that day.   What I do not understand; is why can I go to Chicago dine at such top restaurants such as; Girl and the Goat; RL; The Pump Room; Table Fifty-Two; The Purple Pig; Frontera Grill and The Publican and be welcomed with open arms. Many of the chefs at these restaurants have been on Top Chef and published cookbooks.  How is it that their establishments are welcoming to the lone diner; yet a small Maplewood restaurant is not?  I understand they have a small space; but if you are going to sit single diners at the bar; let them order from the entire menu. Before posting; I shared this review with other friends who are single diners and being women; they said for them they would not feel comfortable eating at the bar and would not eat here if a table was not an option.   Disclaimer: I did dine here as a couple opening week and was not impressed. I contributed that to opening week jitters and wanted to give them another chance. It is a shame that I have not had that opportunity. [REVIEW_12] Previously; I had rated this restaurant with four stars. However; after today's horrible experience; I can barely even give it a one star. The waitress was fine. The rest; just the worst experience I have ever had at a brunch; the absolute worst! There were seven of us who waited and waited and waited for our food while others who came in after us ordered; ate and left. After an hour and 15 minutes; one of the people in our party had to leave and cancelled her order. The waitress told us they hadn't started on any of our orders at that point. Unbelievable!!!! I told the waitress I was extremely dissatisfied with the situation snd told her to share that with the manager. Truly THE WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE.  I have no intention of ever going back there. [REVIEW_13] Ya; unfortunately our favorite local theater has officially crashed and burned! Last time we go.... just isn't worth $47 for three adult tickets; then my wife and I have to run the theater too.  I will start with arrival; an irritated bartender; upset customers asking for help; getting eye rolls from employee; then once the movie started; had to tell same irritated bartender to have someone turn off the bright lights in the movie theater; the movie has been running for 5 minutes already; had to change out soda twice; both were flat; with very little syrup.  screen was dark; no surround sound on. All in all; was a great place at one time; now; just drive by; you will be glad you did.  It was obvious no management or any sense of concern for the customer. What a joke! [REVIEW_14] Service wasn't good; wait time wasn't bad but it seemed like our food had been just sitting up in the window because it was so cold. My steak seemed really raw for medium rare. Got no butter with my now tiny rolls. Was really sad paying 40$ for mediocre food. Friends sides came in a styrofoam bowl. Not planning on returning. Sad thing is that it used to be so good. :( [REVIEW_15] A St. Pete institution. New and slightly used books. Good selection of Florida titles. Gardening. Arts. Architecture. History. Read peeps. You're not smart enough and have a lot to learn. Cool browsing experience and great indie shops and eateries around it on lovely and artsy Central Avenue. [REVIEW_16] So I'm walking around looking for a place to eat and stop in here because it's not a chain type place; looks local. So I sit by the fish tank in the middle of a bunch of dirty tables; order some food from a menu the I had to get myself and has to many items on it for everything be good so I play it safe and order a beer and some fried food. I'm sitting at the table for 10mins Questioning why I'm not drinking my beer the bar was not busy and the bartender was not busy so I just walked out. [REVIEW_17] Omg! Do not go here for food! I can not stress this enough. I began by ordering a coffee which they did not have brewed. They made a new batch and then informed me that they did not have milk or cream. She later admitted to me that they had milk but it expired a month ago  They proceeded to stir whip cream into my coffee. It was awful and became curd-like within minutes. The pizza was just plain terrible. Cheese wasn't even melted and the dough was still moist. The service was also the worst I've had in Indiana. I literally got a look of disgust when I walked in and the girl was pissed off the entire time I was there. I wouldn't feed my dog from here. Beer only if you come here. [REVIEW_18] From the very beginning the hostess was also working as the cashier so we weren't even welcomed when we came in. We had to ask the hostess for a table and we're made to wait for no good reason. The server was pretty much non existent and was very unfriendly she didn't even introduce herself or stop by the table (let alone ask us how our food was). I order the biscuits and gravy and a side of eggs. My food was cold when it came out and wasn't even that good. And on top of it all the food is way overpriced ($30 for French toast; biscuits and gravy; and 2 sides? NO THANKS). Don't even bother wasting your time or money here. Overall terrible; definitely never coming back. [REVIEW_19] Terrible experience! My wife ordered a mild sausage sandwich because she needs to stay away from spicy food.  They substituted with jalapeño flavored anyway with out even asking; after she stated she did not want anything spicy. How irresponsible. Will never visit again. Visit at your own risk!!!!!' [REVIEW_20] Extremely slow service (20 mins in an EMPTY drive thru) and first time around they missed a full half of my order! I come back and they're less than apologetic and proceed to give me 90% of my order! What does it take for a girl to get what she pays for around here?!! Not coming to this location again; just horrible. [REVIEW_21] Perfectly seasoned meatloaf. Too bad it was served cold w cold coffee. [REVIEW_22] Yelp doesn't allow to leave 0 star review; so that is why you see one star. Me and my wife are moving from NY to South California; and we contacted 5 different moving companies. I sent my initial email to United Van Lines on 05/02/2018; and soon I got email back with Virtual Survey confirmation for 05/10. The lady that did virtual survey was very meticulous and professional and we ""screened"" through the whole apartment in 15 minutes. No one contacted me after that; so I sent a second email almost a month after; on 06/05 asking if everything is ok; and if I can get the quote. I don't need to mention that other 4 companies sent their quotes in less than 48 hours. Since no one replied til today; I called the direct phone and I left the message on the answering machine. No one called me back. I hope everything is ok; and that no one is hurt; because I don't see any other reasonable explanation why they are avoiding me. Very; very unprofessional. [REVIEW_23] If you want to get a good price on an oil change this is a good place to go.  If you want to be price gauged on any other work this is also a good place to go.    So please do not go here unless you are are looking for an inexpensive oil change.  I guess others may already know this since we stopped at Big O tire first and they had a long line of cars  so we went right right down the road to this location and went right in with no wait.     They do at least have free wi fi.    Update since I just drove said car for the first time since work done.   My teen age son is primary driver.    So I just noticed the mileage on the reminder sticker is wrong.    Many places put the mileage on the sticker that you get a new change(or a date).  Some may put on the mileage when this oil change was done.   This location out in a number that was neither.   The mileage is about 500 miles off what it should have been if it was the mileage when job done.   In other words it appears that they are trying to get their customers to think oil changes are needed quicker than they actually are. [REVIEW_24] The crab balls was good but the food is over priced and they don't give you enough food.. I won't go back there ever... [REVIEW_25] This place is super unprofessional. The manager who says his name is ""Johnson"" is extremely unprofessional. He doesn't understand that when working in a place of business where people are accompanied by their children you cannot curse out loud. He also doesn't understand that of a customer comes in close to closing time you don't tell them to hurry up. I don't care how good the food is. I wouldn't know because I lost my appetite and left. This guy is trash. And the management should realize that he's a reflection of them and their business. Definitely stay away. If you're starving; eat air. This place is terrible [REVIEW_26] Soo disappointed. Ordered delivery and specified that it was from a hotel. They brought no utensils and told them I did not specify them. They changed my order without asking me. The kicker was that the Biryani I ordered had hard things in it; some of which were whole cardamon pods but also (and yuck) a partially eaten stone fruit. Please don't get delivery. If anything eat there; but I will not [REVIEW_27] The hotel was really nice but the service we had downstairs in the bar was ridiculous.  The tables were so dirty. I asked the bartender (Kaitlin) if they could wipe it down and she handed me a wet paper towel.  Which okay; that's fine; not a big deal. We ordered our food and she just kinda dropped everything off on one end of the table and then left.  The only waitress/bartender who ever came by to ask if we were okay was Lindsay.  It seemed like they thought they were too good to offer good service. Oh; yea; and Zoey was rude enough that I complained to the manager of the hotel.  I would never come back here and I would def tell my friends not to either.  Oh; and don't try to use your Straz tickets for the free appetizer like they advertise if you want your ticket back.  My husband had to get into an argument with Kaitlin so I could get my ticket back even though we were told we'd get them back. You'd probably get better service at your local dive bar but at least you won't be paying $12 for a cocktail. [REVIEW_28] I ate at the Denny at the corner of oracle and river rd in Tucson; I ordered some grits and side order of sausage; and 3 eggs; that was the Nastiest meal I have ever had; that's a shame because the people that worked there was kind and helpful; but the food was terrible; the grits was dry and hard and not done; the sausage tasted like meatless sausage and boiled; the eggs tasted like they had been cooked hours ago. The 1 Star is for the kind people that waited on me. [REVIEW_29] First time at Wolfgang. Crowded; dirty floors; poor service; it has it all. Only redeeming factor was the excellent crisp Chardonnay. [REVIEW_30] When I received my to-go order; I asked for a couple cups of water and tomato sauce.  The cashier said he needed to first take care of customers waiting to order; and he would call our number later.  Even after we finished our food 40 minutes later; we never heard him calling again.  I think we deserve better when we ordered $35 worth of food.",5
65,"[REVIEW_1] I have sears home warranty; and they offer a free annual heating and cooling preventative maintenance check. I called sears; they gave me a confirmation number to call EMCO with. EMCO promptly made an appointment for me on a Saturday. While they did offer the 3 hours window; he showed up right on time at 9 am.   The serviceman was non judgemental; as I had no clue about maintenance of my oil heater. He immediate gave me a long lesson; and showed me everything I needed to know and all the time frames of when things needed to be checked. I had a yellow leak; that turned out to be the chimney not having sealant among other items. He told me the price; which was fair considering I had only had the furnace looked at once since I moved in 5 yrs ago. I made appt a few weeks later for another Saturday to have the work completed. Window as 9 to 11. They called at 945 letting me know they had to reschedule due to illness.  I was unhappy but ok with that. I scheduled for the following Tuesday from 3 to 5.  The setter called me at 345 Tuesday to reschedule again...Not happy.  I voiced my dismay as I took off again from work to meet this window. She said she'd check and call back. Well; I thought the worst; but they surprised me. They showed up at 5 without the call back; and he had a few guys with him. Each were finishing their different jobs from all cross the city; chose to work late to help me with my house. They came; they saw; they completed the work and my heat was on and I felt secure and safe. And even before the last guy left; who was the initial gentleman from the maintenance check; he went over EVERYTHING with me on the maintenance They also were very clean; there was no dirt or oil anywhere; and they still vacuumed the heater room prior to leaving.  This is a reputable company; I am am soooo happy with the service! [REVIEW_2] Just got my delivery of honey BBQ wings; a sampler; and whole cheese steak. Quick service delicious choice for a lazy day.   Wings were really meaty and saucy. Bonus  Sampler came with a little bit of everything. Bonus is the variety of sauces to dip with. Thank you!  Cheese steak - was jot my meal but from the look of it the bread was freshly made as described by other yelpers.   This place is a neighborhood gem. Glad I found it!!!! [REVIEW_3] Best meal enjoyed when traveling to Tennessee. Smart eclectic flavors make the sandwiches a real hit. I loved the smoked turkey and a side of the roasted carrots. Finished off with the apple ricotta cake perfect indulgence without the guilt.   Cool interiors; too. [REVIEW_4] Lisa is the best at what she does. See her on TV: https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=748903991831120&set=vb.283845548336969&type=2&theater [REVIEW_5] This is actually the first negative review I've ever written because I've never had an experience bad enough to warrant one. Shit happens sometimes. I'll also preface this by saying I've dined here many times with no issue. Unfortunately; I won't be dining from here any longer. My order tonight was literally inedible. The crab rangoon tasted like the cream cheese had turned; the soup didn't taste like anything at all and there were several undercooked pieces of chicken in my fried rice. Even after realizing this; I had no intention of writing a negative review because like I stated above; shit happens. However; I changed my mind after I called to request a refund (because being served undercooked chicken warrants a refund in my opinion) and I was told I couldn't get one because ""they didn't know how to do a refund on the credit card machine."" I was then offered a $20 gift certificate to compensate me for my $32 order; which is laughable. [REVIEW_6] Holy  so amazing I can't put it into words; live music ; fresh beignets; pastries; great !!!! Why would you ever have breakfast elsewhere?  Wanted to stay here all day even in the  couldn't believe with as much hype as there was that this place actually lived up to it [REVIEW_7] Couldn't eat because no one would seat me or take order. Here for a conference. People have short lunches. Why understaff? Why no hostess? Why no clear togo process. You are in a conference hotel. Managment or corporate need to address leadership here. Saw food sitting in window just dying. [REVIEW_8] The food here is really incredible. I had the fried chicken in a bag and it was delicious! The menu offers a nice twist on southern comfort food. I love the decor and the service is excellent. Our waiter Adam was friendly and attentive and thoroughly explained the menu to us. We had a bunch of desserts but my favorite was the chocolate pecan pie with BACON ICECREAM! Yes! I highly recommend this place. Can't wait to go back! [REVIEW_9] I'm a vegetarian who loves fried foods. This is the perfect spot for me! [REVIEW_10] You have not lived until you have tried their Bananas Foster French Toast.  My wife and I agreed that it was probably one of the single best food items we have both ever tasted!    No trip to NOLA is complete without stoping by and trying this stuff!  I have told friends and family about this place and we will be sure to return on our next visit. Mmmm...so damn good. [REVIEW_11] As good as it gets for a food truck! Food Court chinese (which I'm sure you know exactly what I mean by that) is one of those lunches I just shamelessly crave. I have to say this beats all cheap Chinese in center city flavor wise. Not to mention it's actually cheaper then all other options for ""food court Chinese"". Shrimp and broccoli; egg roll; lo mein and a soda all for $6? I'm in. Once a week. Lines are usually long but they move relatively fast so don't be deterred. They have a spicy option you can add if you're into that. Huge portions and super friendly. Enjoy frugal friends! [REVIEW_12] Quite possibly the perfect business model to fail if it wasn't for a sequestered clientel?  We visit New Orleans often; and it is an activity of ours to bet on how many beers or ingredients they are out of.  Bartenders rude and swearing. It's almost comical; we sit and listen to patrons asking for draft beers and mixed drinks and getting responses ""can't do that"".  They said ""No mules""; to at least 5 people as we sat for about 30 mins today.  2 out of 4 taps not working. What an absolute waste of opportunity. [REVIEW_13] Their bobba is amazing! All of the food I've tried is exquisite and reasonably priced; I would definitely recommend eating here and trying some of their food. [REVIEW_14] I can really only speak for their coffee and the atmosphere; but I know I'll be back for more! I went the other night to meet up with a friend and get some work done; and this was the perfect spot! They had tons of comfy chairs and a nice quiet area upstairs conducive to productivity. My americano was perfect; and I can't wait to go back to explore their menu and try out some gelato! [REVIEW_15] Over the last year I've tried many; many; many things on the menu.  My rating has not changed.  First; parking can be a bear.  Despite the numerous parking spaces; it's still gonna be tough getting in and out; and a spot; but trust me; you'll be fine with a little walk to the door.  Get there a little early from the lunch hour or you'll be waiting in line and you'll be looking for a spot to park your butt.  Now that you're inside; check out the menu board.  There's nothing I've tried that isn't good; and most things are great.  Fish Taco Tuesday...it should be added to the Outlook calendar as a standard reminder.  Brisket tacos; with BBQ sauce (I add the white sauce too); are splendid.  Tortas; burritos; whatever you pick; you're probably gonna be under $10 with a drink and chips; so splurge for the white; creamy goodness called queso.  Once you've paid; go to the drinks and pick ""Baja Fruit Tea"" as your drink.  You're welcome. [REVIEW_16] We were really excited to try the Sunday Brunch . We just moved to Dunedin and have been to many spots on Main Street ( Living Room; Casa Tina ; Black Pearl; Pisces; Bon Appetite; Sea Sea Riders ) and had great food and fun . We got there around noon and it was busy . The hostess was sort of confusing but we told her table for two inside . She gave us a pager and showed us to the bar . The bar seats were full so we sort of stood by the door . We were there around 10 minutes when another couple came in and checked in at the hostess stand and came into the bar to wait . About 20 minutes later I checked in at hostess stand and was surprised they were working off two waiting lists - I thought that was odd . The hostess told me not too much longer . The next couple sat was the couple who came in 10 minutes after us . We were called by the host who proceeded to seat us outside . I told him we had asked for inside he was very nice and apologized saying he thought we were first available but now saw we had asked for inside . As we walked back to the bar we saw the 10 minute arriving after us couple at their inside table and decided to leave . We told the hostess ;who really only cared what number our pager was ; that we were upset and she seemed not to really care at all . After repeating that I was upset about the couple being sat before us she mumbled something about coming back and trying them again ! What ?!! Too many places on Main Street for that kind of service . We go out a lot and we won't be going to Kelly's again . We stoped in on Thursday night to the outside bar and asked the new bartender ( she was sweet but not trained ) if it was happy hour she said she didn't know and had to go find out . We enjoyed our drink watching the new bartender and bar back decide what she was going to eat ... that should have been a clue not to try Brunch . [REVIEW_17] My wife & I took 8 kids to the Sanctuary; the kids ages were 5 to 15. We all love it! Mr. Bob gave us a tour of the sanctuary and told us about all the different types of parrots. He is very passionate about the birds and it shows. He taught the kids things about parrots and at dinner time that night the kids were excited to answer questions I asked about parrots. Me. Bob made sure each kid got a feather from a bird too. It was a wonderful way to spend a couple of hours in the morning and well worth the 1.5 hour drive (1 way) to get there. We are planning another trip next spring to visit again. When your there; make sure you pet Jack the dog too. [REVIEW_18] Outstanding food and decor. This place is a gem. I would drive over here from San Francisco to eat. It is that good. I will definitely be back. [REVIEW_19] I took my expensive Christian Louboutins here to be dyed since I had heard that this place was one of the best in the city. Boy; what an overstatement. I wanted my studded gray CLs dyed black. I SPECIFICALLY told them to please; please; please be careful not to get any dye on the red soles because that is what makes a Louboutin a Louboutin. I also asked if they could dye it without covering the studs. They told me YES. They would tape off everything that wasn't going to be dyed and it would turn out perfect. I came back a week later; like they told me. Only 1 shoe was half done. So they told me another week.  I came in to pick them up today to find the worst dye job I have ever seen in my life. There was black dye all over the studs; all over the inside and the toe box; and (worst of all) all over the red soles. Besides the damage; all of the gray had not even been dyed. There were random un-dyed patches everywhere. I told them that this was not the kind of work I was promised. Then they changed their story and said that it would have been impossible to tape off the studs. They said I should not have even tried to get them dyed. When I questioned why there is dye on the inside and why the red soles are covered in black dye splotches; they said ""I don't know"". They told me they could TRY to remove the dye but that the red might come off; too. I told them this is completely unacceptable. And then they gave me an attitude. They said ""Look; we already told you we could remove the dye. I don't understand why you keep standing here talking.""  If the job could not be done; they should have told me ahead of time. I understand it was a tedious job; what with all the studs; but there is no excuse for getting dye all over the inside and soles. He said the dye would come off as I walked. ....YOU DON'T WALK ON THE ARCHES OF THE HEELS. I asked for my money back and they told me they dyed my shoes like I asked; so what more do I want. I just took my shoes and left. They must be crazy to think I would leave my shoes there for them to ""fix"".  I instead took them to Superior Shoe Repair near 15th and Walnut. I have taken shoes there before; so I should've went there to begin with because I know they are used to dealing with designer shoes. They said they could fix it; so I will be reviewing them when I pick them up this week. [REVIEW_20] Great place for dinner!! Had to wait bc it was the weekend but food was good & gator tail was delish!!! Walking distance from our hotel was great bc there wasnt any parking when we were there it was super busy! [REVIEW_21] This place is FANTASTIC.  I've been here twice so far and have been taken back EARLY both times.  When walking in; I was immediately greeted and offered a drink (beer; wine; iced tea; water; etc.)  I was also welcomed by the friendliest little bulldog; named Seamus.  Kristy is a hair magician!!  She is so personable and really commited to giving her clients exactly what they want; or steering them in the direction of making them look great!  Not only did I leave with my thirst quenched; and my hair looking great -- it didn't cost me an arm and a leg!!   On my last visit; Kristy turned me platinum; and I couldn't be happier with the results.  Her blowout lasted me the rest of the week and I'm still recieving compliments on how great the color is!  I'll be sending all of my friends here. [REVIEW_22] when my boyfriend casually suggested we go out and rent some videos; i had to stop for a second and ask ""wait; video stores still exist? don't you have netflix?"" of course; i forgot that boyfriend is a cranky old man in training and hates technology. so; i begrudgingly agreed to go to the so-called ""video store"" -- and was pleasantly surprised!  Casa Video is awesome :) they have just about any movie you could ask for -- in DVD and VHS format (i know; who still uses VHS? oh well). They also run different promotions; such as 2 for 1 rentals on certain days; and a ""film festival"" where they list off staff picks (while i was there it was black and white movies -- very cool to see the staff members choices!)  We rented ALOT of movies while i was there -- mostly zombie movies; our favorite genre. They had ALL the obscure movies I was looking for -- including Fulchi's ""Zombi""; which i didn't see on my first lap through the shelves and was very upset that i couldn't rent it. but i was thrilled when I found it (finally!)  Staff is really nice and helpful too; they directed us to the sections where we could find weird subtitled films and exploitation films (certain horror films are considered exploitation; i guess); and even gave us free popcorn! yaay!  The only bad/weird thing is that what you see on the shelves is what they have. If it's not there; it means its rented. So; there are basically no backup copies of any movies (with the exception of new releases); so it's every movie hound for themselves.  As a bonus (for me) they had just about every B-horror movie i could dream of -- including many I had never heard of! I might have to ditch netflix for Casa Video when I move out there................maybe. [REVIEW_23] After giving them another shot from talking to the owner . I was placed with an aesthetician who was incredible .. she was personable and seemed like she really wanted to be there .. we made sure to book my appointment out and verified the number they had in my file which was wrong because I changed it so luckily she asked .. I'll be back to see Lynne [REVIEW_24] Delicious as always! My son and I ordered a  Greek Salad and an amazing pizza.  Definitely one of the best pizzas in town! And the salad; especially the dressing; is addictive! The service is great but we go for the food! [REVIEW_25] During my trip they went above and beyond. I was staying at a nearby hotel and was just outside of walking distance for dragging my luggage around. One of their staff gave me a ride to the hotel and saved me from having to get a cab. [REVIEW_26] I was shocked by my stay here.  I came for a wedding weekend and felt that I would have had a better experience at a a Holiday Inn Express down the street.  My hotel room left me feeling absolutely disgusted.  There was hair all over the bathroom; on towels and heaped on the floor.  The headboard had HUGE dust bunnies hanging off the front of it.  The next morning I go to breakfast and the service was clearly that of people motivated to get the back of the house or communal tasks done; but not actually to serve the people.  I was asked and ordered orange juice; only to have to ask a different server 10 minutes later.  This happened multiple times with different members of our group.  Then another table must have requested tabasco sauce; which we had on our table.  The server comes over between two of our members and takes it; there was no ""Are you using this?"" or even ""Excuse Me.""  They need to find a different way to motivate the staff because it did not meet basic service expectations.  Do not waste your money by staying at this hotel; you will only be disappointed and potentially disgusted. [REVIEW_27] Okay maybe the word awesome is overused but that is how I would describe Tobey's Junk Hauling service. He communicates well; shows up on time; and takes care of business for a reasonable price. Awesome. [REVIEW_28] The pear and cheese pasta is the best pasta I've had in Philly; but maybe ever.  It's absolutely amazing.  Skip the Italian Market and just head here! [REVIEW_29] Used to come here while on business to the city. Dive bars are hip. Not this one. This one is just a mess. Bugs; I mean COCKROACHES; crawl along the bar and into people's coats (I overheard). I have seen the roaches and had a few crawl onto my hand. In the men's bathroom there's just a trash bag taped on the wall where a urinal used to be.  I have also overheard that 3 female employees have quit. Which makes it seem like it's not a safe place for ladies.  The bartender I encountered seemed very overwhelmed and perturbed with serving customers that weren't  friends and that weren't doing shots of cheap liquor. Bartender was also playing obnoxious hip hop too loud and denied access to the jukebox that clearly was just paused; not ""broken""; like he poorly tried to explain. I believe ownership or management changed since the last time I visited. Definitely not what it used to be. [REVIEW_30] Omgness the pizza is delicious!! Their gluten free crust is actually really good!! The bartender; Ginny; is awesome and really makes it feel like a neighborhood spot!",23
66,"[REVIEW_1] We arrived for our stay excited for the weekend.  We requested 6 bath towels daily; and that  never happened. TV reception in living room was not working; and were told that was controlled in California and nothing could be done.  A/C was not working properly that too was controlled from elsewhere and unable to cool room to our satisfaction.  We had to call every day  for towels. After calling three times and still not towels; we canceled our dinner; and ordered take in. We  spoke with Manger Hunter. Hunter apologized and assured me we would have issues resolved.  TV tech came up and said we were not a priority but promised he would have it fixed 100% and would come back to check; never happened.  Hunter was personally bringing 12 towels up six for that day and 6 for the next morning I had requested this.  He called back tied up and sent staff who brought 6 towels; when placing towels on table he dropped towel on the carpet ; looked chuckled and walked away. We had a free breakfast for two and the scrambled eggs and omelette had a very unusual taste and texture.  I don't believe these eggs were cracked fresh that morning. Well we felt sick and sure enough; vomiting is not the best way to travel back home. The list goes on and on; but this was this was most unnecessary.    We are sad t see your staff did not live up to your standards.   Respectfully;  Matthew & Alicia [REVIEW_2] The room was rundown and right next to a watercooler. There is literally no soundproofing  so I had the pleasure of listening to teenage girls pound on different doors all night long. I had to call security to deal with the noise issue and it even took them quite a bit of time to get the noise under control. [REVIEW_3] Pretty much the best Italian restaurant in the entire Philly area.  Went there for lunch today.   Excellent bread. I asked for garlic my wife no garlic. They brought out two full bowls  Bruschetta was real good.   Toasted longhots stuffed with prosciutto were killer!  I had a HUGE portion of angel hair with hot sausage. I could only finish half it was so big.   My wife kept stealing mine while she ate gnocchi in vodka sauce that she said was great.   It's a small place on the outside but has a big dining room  You can't go wrong at this place! [REVIEW_4] It was our last night in NOLA and I made dinner reservations for 7:30 pm. I was impressed with the decor and design of the interior which use to be a church many years ago. The building had it's 100th birthday in March and is located  Mid City in the midst of cemeteries; funeral homes and some residential.  Our waiter Gregory N who formerly worked for a well known restaurant in town was humorous; professional and a native of NOLA. We started off with a bottle of Merlot and ordered the smoked deep fried soft shell crab and a cup of seafood gumbo. When the soft shell arrived I was taken back how large it was and tasted divine. The gumbo was also yummy and contained generous amounts of seafood.  For dinner I selected the Flounder; fried green tomato; and stuffed mirliton. OMG this entree was so delish. The fish was superb and the stuffed mirliton which was my first time experiencing and was delish. I can honestly say I experienced authentic Cajun food at Redemption. I sampled the stuffed gulf shrimp with crab stuffing and the taste was also outstanding. We ended our magnificent meal with the Crepes with Louisiana strawberries  What's funny is how I stumbled onto Redemption's by dinning at their casual sister restaurant earlier in the week which is located in Prairieville - Tommy's Fish house. Christian who runs Tommy's recommended Redemption.   We had the pleasure to meet the owner of Redemption Marie and head chef Greg Picolo who were gracious to spend some time with us and make us feel welcomed. I must say that the seafood was the freshest quality and reasonably priced compared to several other high end restaurants we dined at NOLA.  Redemption exceeded my expectations and I would definitely return here next time I'm in NOLA. [REVIEW_5] We travel 20 minutes from our home in East Germantown to get pizza and wing dings from Slices. Both my husband and I are not Philadelphia natives; and we find most Philly pizza appalling; but Slices gets the job done! They also make delicious buffalo chicken cheesesteaks! Yum Yum! [REVIEW_6] This place just opened not to long ago so I decided to try it out. We don't have a lot of bar-b-q joints around here and the ones we dont have dont taste like real authentic bar-b-q.  This place is great. For my first trip I got a brisket sandwich and some pulled pork chili. I have to say this food is awesome. It has a great smokey flavor and taste as good as the best bar-b-q I've had before. I can't wait to taste their other food. The owner also took me out to show me his smoker and it is awesome. He had about 4 briskets and 8 pork butts cooking and they looked delicious. He also has 2 more cabinets on his cooker that were unused so I'm sure he can fit much much more. All in all I highly recommend this place to anyone. The only downside is that they are only open on Saturdays from 11-7. But its just something to look forward to on the weekend. [REVIEW_7] When I lived in Florida; This was my go to place for relaxing. My best friend and I would always get a full set pedi; relax in the massive massage chairs; have a glass of wine that you had the choice of and just melt into the hot water; on our feet. It was a quiet calm atmosphere. great skills they used; clean tools; professional job overall in their work and we kept coming back because of that. I miss this place for a relaxing break to take. Next time I'm in Tampa; I'll be hitting this place up again. [REVIEW_8] Love this place. Friendly staff; quick service; good music; great atmosphere to work OR hang. My personal go-to is the Fedora Frittata and an iced mocha :) [REVIEW_9] I have now been waiting in line for 30 minutes for my order to be processed. Unreal!  Poor management or lack thereof! [REVIEW_10] Ok yeah; the service can be a little high falutin'; and the wait is painful but this is THE BEST BURGER EVER.  That's all you need to know.  The BEST. [REVIEW_11] DON'T BOTHER GETTING THE GROUPON. The sushi was terrible and they DIDN'T HONOR the Groupon because I didn't present it when I was seated. I've used many; many Groupons in other establishments and have never been refused. I called Groupon and got a refund from them and reported that Yakuza did not accept it.  BIG THUMBS DOWN for Yakuza; thumbs up for Groupon. [REVIEW_12] Craving sushi tonight but wanted to get away from the norm. I remembered Kei Sushi and headed over to that part of town.  We walked in to a nice; pleasant atmosphere and were seated quickly. The ambience and decor are great and it's not overly loud.  Our sushi chef; Isiah; made some nice suggestions right off the bat a they were delicious. The nigiri was very fresh and full of flavor.  My favorites of the night were the ceviche appetizer; the pink lady and the albacore.  Will put on the top of my list for sushi. [REVIEW_13] By far THE BEST sushi... small place; but the sushi is absolutely to DIE FOR.. the Sexy Alhen is my favorite; they are known for the Sexyman Roll. ALL of the rolls are good; original; and there is a huge variety to pick from.  Staff is friendly; and service is good. [REVIEW_14] I used go to Grace Nails and made the switch when Epic opened up.  I have had nothing but great experiences! I got my nails done yesterday and my thumb nail chipped so I returned today to get the fixed. They put another coat on all of them and fixed 3 nails completely at no charge.  I've always been impressed by their work but their service is awesome as well!  They have a client for as long as I have nails to paint :) [REVIEW_15] Food is below average. Waiter is unfriendly.. I asked which dishes are less spicy; he said dismissively: all of them are spicy because Indian food is spicy.. OK; they never brought a chutney tray and we never asked. They constantly were out of naan which wasn't very flavorful. Yeah; that's the last time for us. The decor was colorful. That's what the one star is for. [REVIEW_16] Definitely top rated Sushi in my book! The fish is incredibly fresh; they do not overwhelm you with rice; and they have awesome specials on week nights. The sushi chefs are very attentive and give you super fast service! The ambiance is tranquil and the restaurant is very clean...if you haven't been to sushi Rose; this is a MUST try! [REVIEW_17] Hilton properties are some of the oldest;  most dilapidated properties in the hotel business.  Additionally;  the customer service is the very worst overall with a few exceptions.  Made a reservation here for 1 bedroom suite.  Suite wasn't ready.  Had a 12:30 lunch mtg  Needed to shower and change but suite booked wasn't ready.  What I thought was a courtesy extend turned out to be bait a D switch.  They gave e me a 'courtesy room' with the understanding that upon my return;  I would get the suite I booked.  I  returned just to be to told that 'the room I booked had been sold.' Really;????  The suite was $250. The downside graded room was $235. I couldn't cancel the room and all of the rooms at a lower rate were 'sold out'  How is that possible so quickly?  Fake apologies we're given;  but no satisfaction when more could have been done.   Never again. [REVIEW_18] We've been there for Valentine's Day !!  It was actually really good; well priced and really nice service !! They Cook in front of us as well ! Awesome experience [REVIEW_19] ""Feather free"" in my profile.  ""Feather free"" in my reservation.  ""Feather free"" by special request when I called four hours before arrival.  ""Feather free"" confirmed upon check in.  In the room?  Feathers.  Will Hyatt ever understand how important this is?  Will it take another trip to the emergency room?   And $29/night to park also absurd for St. Louis.  ""Sorry about that sir"" gets old. [REVIEW_20] This location is by far the best of all the Café Du Monde I've tried during my visit in NOLA. The beignets are consistently not oily and freshly cooked whenever we came here. (Been in this location 3 times in 6 days back in Dec 2017) what's more; there ice mocha and cafe mocha are also really good it's not too sweet and works well with the beignets. Wish they would open a location in SoCal. [REVIEW_21] Horns gets one star for the waitress with the amber necklace... she was fabulous.  If not for her cheerful friendly demeanor and attention it would have been no stars.  Burned pancakes  that tasted sour.  The kitchen obviously didn't care about the product they sent out. [REVIEW_22] This is the worst service I have had at a restaurant in Philadelphia. First; they charged myself and the rest of my group a $5 cover; but then proceeded to seat us outside. The server forgot about us and we eventually were able to put our drink orders in. When they came;  we had lower than average margaritas and sangrias. I wouldn't come back here again. [REVIEW_23] Best sushi in SB! They don't take reservations so you may have to wait a bit for a table depending on the day of the week. [REVIEW_24] Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant in Delaware County! Aside from never having had a bad meal here; I can also tell you their fried calamari is the best. I order it every time. [REVIEW_25] I organized a farewell lunch party here for my office and it was just great! I had never been there  but wow great value and service!  they easily accomodated my reservation for 19 ppl; and had the table set up nicely.  the server was friendly and informative.  the pricing was out of this world too - i mean talk about bargain at lunch or dinner! for lunch you get a salad w/your meal; even if you dont get an entree!  I had the eggplant parm stuffed w/broccoli and vegggies - eparm was GREAT but the veggies were quite crunchy and eveno thought i asked for no potatoes; they gave them to me anyway.  all my co-workers raved about their meal too - esp the pork special many of them got.  I would go back again - and we did!  For another co worker party for lunch - the best thign was that we had a paty of 9; called 15 minutes before we got there and they had no problem getting us a table!  The waitress though had very short paitence.  My meal was awesome - a special of the day - crab; mushroom and asparagus quiche with a wonderful small light salad of spinach; cantaloupe; and strawberries with a raspberry vinagrette.  Deelish! and the coffee was amazing again as was the meal value! [REVIEW_26] I didn't enjoy my experience at Clayton nails today 7/3/2015. It was all because of the nail tech; i didn't get her name but she was young; Vietnamese with a med length bob haircut. I went in for a gel color polish change. Her work is not as neat as what im use to there. She for some reason placed two scolding hot towels over each of my hands while removing the old color. I told her that the towels were too hot and she than removed them and swung them in the air to cool off than reapplied. She than asked 'is this better princess "".  Than she turned around and ask if that woke me up. I've had a gel polish color change several times before; no one has ever placed hot towels on my hands EVER;  i don't know why she did. After the gel color polish was applied and dry she repeatedly reapplied a top thick coat over and over. I kept having to place my hands under the uv light again; thats never happened before either. I guess i have to pick one person to go to and stick to them religiously. [REVIEW_27] This is our go to spot for happy hour.  Half price margarita pitchers and great food. I love their smoked wings; texas style chili; steak tacos; and turkey BLT.  Actually i've never had a bad meal here.  When in doubt we go to el camino and always end up having a great meal and wondeful time. [REVIEW_28] Delicious and the waitress was awesome!  We stayed there for lunch for almost 3 hours and never felt rushed and we never felt like we were overstaying our welcome.  Great food!  Great service!!! [REVIEW_29] Best lamb skewers we've ever had so far! The place is nice and clean; with lots of cute decorations. Everything we ordered was surprisingly yummy and their portion is huge.  Very good service too!  Highly recommend if you wanna try authentic Chinese kabob and northeastern food! [REVIEW_30] Love this place!! I will return when we come back to Nashville. We maybe waited 10 minutes outside and that was it. We got  in and out in about an hour. Food was AMAZING! They service was great!",20
67,"[REVIEW_1] Horrible; I wish we read the reviews before going in; what a downer this place was!  Let us sit for an hour and then brought out cold food.  My two grand sons were with and they were pinging off the wall by the time the cold food got to our table.   I have literally been to iHops all over and hands down this was the worst experience we have ever had.  Generally I think of iHop as a safe bet while traveling; but this may have ruined that rep for good. [REVIEW_2] Super amazing homemade food. They renew the interior and kitchen and it's looks great! Honestly hands down best Mexican in philly. Tamalex is good BUT this place is another story. Top Mexican by far. Only downside is cash only. Enjoy. [REVIEW_3] We came in just before noon and there was just one other couple in the restaurant. The drive thru traffic was slow.   However; EVERY single table was dirty.  We asked for a cloth to clean off a table with. You'd think that might encourage them to send someone out to do some cleanup; but no. We wiped our table ourselves and returned the cloth to the counter.   After this; the restaurant got busier; and the tables remained filthy. Someone finally came out to wipe down tables about halfway through our meal; after several more customers had to wipe down their own tables.   As for the food; I wasn't impressed with that either. I ordered the mini sirloin burgers and they arrived over cooked and dry; even the buns were burnt in places. Plus; only 1 of the 3 burgers actually had any grilled onions on it; and then only a very small amount. Most of the toppings lay at the bottom of the carton.   The whole experience was very unsatisfying and I would be reluctant to come back here anytime soon. [REVIEW_4] Worst concert experience I've had. Buyers; beware. They're only interested in your money NOT your experience. My husband spent A LOT of money on an Imagine Dragons VIP package and it left much to be desired. The ""gift bag"" was filled with a small; cheap crumpled poster; plastic sunglasses; a pop socket; and a phone charger fit for a circa 2015 android. The ""crowd free shopping"" consisted of about 200 people crammed in a small area with general admission goers; and the ""hassle free entry"" took 45 minute. So; all in all I sit here really pissed about the experience; feeling bad for my husband who wanted to surprise; and the concert hasn't even started yet. Bravo CID. Thank you for seriously putting a damper on my night. [REVIEW_5] There is nothing like the other pics showed!!! I never give out review on Yelp; but I had to comment on this restaurant! I am a sushi lover; the fish was poorly cut and the sushi rice is tasteless. The dynamite we had was extremely salty and loads of mayos. I took one bite left the rest on the table. This is the worst experience l've ever had in a 4.5 star restaurant; please avoid at all cost!!! [REVIEW_6] Without a doubt one of the worst experiences I've ever had my life was presenting myself at the emergency room at Temple Hospital. Five hours before I even saw a triage nurse. Then I was told I had a life-threatening infection I needed emergency surgery.   They parked me in a room where I sat for two hours constantly begging for a glass of water. I kept asking what was going on I needed somebody to explain things to me; they said in a minute in a minute; we're waiting for the doctor.  I finally came to the realization this is not the place I need it to be and got up and left against medical advice.  The next day I went to Bryn Mawr Hospital and had my surgery there along with a two-week hospitalization. I was treated so well I felt almost as if I was a guest at the Ritz Carlton.  Dr Floros saved my life. It turns out I had a MRSA infection and had I waited another 48 hours I would've been dead. Doctors amazing nursing staff I couldn't ask for more! [REVIEW_7] All I can say is Haley makes me look and feel like a Rock Star!!! She is awesome and knows just what I want and delivers. When I say make it blue with green and purple she triangles me up and I come out  looking fabulous. [REVIEW_8] My girlfriend and I decided to try Kalamata's last night at around 7:30. The guy at the counter asked us if we're ready to order even before we had the chance to look at the menu properly; not once but multiple times.   We ordered 2 lamb gyros; a side order of roasted potatoes and the tabouleh. The potatoes came out extremely fast and were lukewarm at best. Either they were premade; and ""microwaved to order"" or were just sitting on a hot plate. Not something I'd expect from any restaurant.   The tabouleh was SOUR - like salad dunked in a bottle of fish sauce sour. We decided to tell the guy upfront our issues with the tabouleh but all we got out of him was ""This is our recipe. This is the way we make it. It's fine if you don't like it; but this is how we make it"". I agree I have no idea what authentic tabouleh tastes like; or how to make it; but I have tasted GOOD tabouleh in the past; and this was far from it. I pity the people who've eaten tabouleh only at this establishment because they're really missing out.   The gyros were pedestrian at best; under-seasoned and most of all under-sauced. The veggies were on one side of the pita; the meat on the other - so you'd never get a mouthful of veggies+meat and only one side of the pocket had the sauce. Suspecting another ""This is how we sauce our gyros. This is our recipe"" moment; we decided to finish our food ASAP.  Finally; the worst offense was that the guy starts closing up shop while we're still eating. Really? I've no idea how this place got 4 stars on yelp; but there are way better restaurants in Nashville for Mediterranean food. [REVIEW_9] I was in the mood for a quick bite at McDonald's. I thought this was the place to go. I went to this McDonald's and got me a nice big Mac; fries and a soda; cost me about nine bucks. No biggie but I told the manager specifically; I wanted hot fries from the fryer.  But she served me cold fries that's been sitting out for at least 10 minutes. I complained but she was mean and rude. All I wanted was hot fries. Is that too much to ask at a McDonald's? She refuse to give me the hot fries and argued with me that the fries were hot. Really? [REVIEW_10] This place is not to be trusted. I came in with my brother and said I would co-sign a lease for him when they came back with numbers inflated 3 times what the Hyundai site advertises. We walked off the lot. They kept calling my brother telling him to come in they would do the deal at that advertised price. UNBEKNOWNST to me they ran the entire lease under my social without my permission and told me as after the paperwork was signed. SCUM BAGS. I called the next day to complain and they blew me off for two weeks straight with excuse until the tags were released   DON""T GO HERE. they are DIRTY. We own a car dealership and I happen to know tags do not drop 36 hours after being tricked into signing a lease contract on my good credit when it was supposed to go in the other persons name.   I am getting an attorney and suing for fraud. [REVIEW_11] I have been here two years in a row for restaurant week and have loved it both times. This place is what I imagine an old boys club being like in the 1960s. Big chairs; Piano playing; and waiters in tuxedos.   The restaurant week menu is a perfect sample of this place for a reasonable price. The prime rib is delicious; some of the best I've ever had. I look forward to restaurant week every year so I can come back.  A surprise was that their chocolate mousse was outstanding. [REVIEW_12] Previously; I had rated this restaurant with four stars. However; after today's horrible experience; I can barely even give it a one star. The waitress was fine. The rest; just the worst experience I have ever had at a brunch; the absolute worst! There were seven of us who waited and waited and waited for our food while others who came in after us ordered; ate and left. After an hour and 15 minutes; one of the people in our party had to leave and cancelled her order. The waitress told us they hadn't started on any of our orders at that point. Unbelievable!!!! I told the waitress I was extremely dissatisfied with the situation snd told her to share that with the manager. Truly THE WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE.  I have no intention of ever going back there. [REVIEW_13] Tried this place out this morning due to the relatively cheap price and good reviews and I was VERY disappointed. I swear my spicy tuna roll was warm and nobody wants room temperature raw fish! The mussels were dried out and tiny and 90% of the rolls on the menu have cream cheese so there's not much variety. I had two rolls and just left rather than continue eating there and will not be returning when there are so many other good sushi options in Reno.  I will saw however that the staff was very friendly; and I don't think it was the staffs fault as much as it as the obviously low quality ingredients. [REVIEW_14] Tried this place the other day the pizza was not very good at all the place before this one was so much better all home made food with it would've stuck around [REVIEW_15] We tried to go here on a Sunday night before a concert.  Got there at 6:30 were on the no wait app.  Said it would be 40 minutes max. We left at 7:40 had not been seated and was told the kitchen was behind.  The last time I was here it took a long time to get our food.  I do not recommend this establishment. [REVIEW_16] Delicious King Cakes (both the chocolate and the traditional)! [REVIEW_17] I just leased a 2017 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited. The salesman was great.  Service; not so!  On a side note; I love how the manufacturer sends out a survey within days of buying a vehicle wanting to know how much you love the vehicle.  Not just jeep but they all do it.  I always respond with...give me 6 months to a year so I can drive it in different conditions.  Then I'll let you know.  I never respond with ""I love it"" in the first few days.  On my drive home from the dealership I noticed an excessive amount of wind noise coming from the passenger side roof area.  I know this vehicle isn't aerodynamic so don't go there. I understand! But the noise on the passenger side was far more noisy than the driver side.  So; I decided I was going to take it back to have it checked.  In the meantime; the blinker that is supposed to blink three times automatically when you move the lever up or down (not locked) worked intermittently.  Most of the time it did blink three times but occasionally it would only blink once.  So; I added this to the list.  They kept it for two days.  Famous quote...""nothing is wrong"".  So I asked; what did you do for two days.  The answer;  We drove it and the wind noise is normal and the blinker never malfunctioned. So I asked; do you believe me that the blinker occasionally malfunctions or do you think I'm making this up?  They said they believe me.  I asked: So if it did malfunction when you were driving it what action would you take?  It was like a dear looking at me in the headlights.  A blank stare.  He finally said he'd have to call technical service.  I asked why he didn't do that in the first place?  He said he had to diagnose it.  I asked; rather sarcastically; did you have some diagnostic equipment connected while driving it so that if it did happen you could troubleshoot it?  He said no; they just need to see it.  Unbelievable!  He said; as long as it doesn't happen for him; there is nothing wrong.  So; reluctantly on my part; we moved on to the wind noise.  Again; he said there was nothing wrong but...they put down a bead of silicone.  I asked why?  If there is nothing wrong; why put down a bead of silicone?  Because we felt it might help.  If there is nothing wrong and its; as you say; normal; why put down a bead of silicone?  Is there a problem or not?  No problem; we just decided to put down a bead of silicone.  A couple of weeks later (4th of July) I ran my jeep through a car wash in West Chester.  Within an hour; and on a 90+ degree day the A/C unit malfunctioned. Air flow went to a minimum.  I changed fan speed and while I could hear the fan increase in speed there was no change in output.  Minimal air flow and the vehicle started getting hot.  After about an hour and a half of this it finally began running properly again.  I called the dealership and told them what happened.  The answer; unless it does it for us we can't do anything about it.  Are you serious?  Are there louvers in the duct work?  Could one of them have gotten stuck?  Is there an area where water from a car wash could have affected or gotten into something to cause this?  Again; where is the diagnostics in all of this?  Simple answer is always; unless it happens for us we can't do anything about it.  Most frustrating group I've ever dealt with.  I HATE THIS JEEP and the fact there is not one competent person to work on it or someone who will take the initiative to diagnose the issues.  Worst purchase I ever made and what makes it so difficult is now that the sale is done; no one cares!  No one!  Oh; but the survey's keep coming.  Such a joke; an absolute joke.  Oh; to top it off; I was told to take it to David's Jeep in Glen Mills.  Perhaps they can find the problem.  Now that's a comforting thought. Just pass the problem on to someone else and in the meantime I'm having to run all over the place.  Never again. [REVIEW_18] Here's an update for my further Comcast experience. Our bill was increased to 250.00 a month. We called and removed some luxery items which brought our bill to 225.00 a month. Called 4 time a to see how we could get our bill lowered; as we have been a loyal customer for 14 years. ""Nothing we can do"" was all I heard. We decided to no longer be raped by this company and set up service with Verizon. Called Comcast to cancel once we got hooked up with Verizon. All of a sudden; they can do better and reduce my bill to 140.00 a month....which I would have been extremely happy with. Unfortunately; it should have been offered the four previous times I called.  I have Verizon now and have been quite happy with the installation; customer service; and overall product.  I wish Comcast would go under because they don't care about quality customer service. They could offer me a years free of service; yet I wouldn't take it on principle. Screw you Comcast! [REVIEW_19] This is such a cute store. My mother and I came by here to buy a couple of gifts for some friends.  I've been in here a few times. I bought a monogrammed letter ornament from here last Christmas; and this time around mama ended up buying 2 bracelets from here. A zebra print bracelet and a spoon bracelet with Amethyst crystals that the owner actually had made herself. Super super cute!   All items are very reasonably priced considering a great majority of the items within the store are actually designed by the owner. She monograms and is into jewelry making. I absolutely loved some of the little dresses and bows she had for some little girl clothes. I do not have kids; but if I did; I for certain would have bought out her store.  At check my mother received a cute little jewelry pouch to hold her newly purchased items; and the owner was extremely nice to even throw in for me which we totally didn't expect.   If you want to see truly 'local' items that are made then I suggest coming in the see the Looking Glass. [REVIEW_20] Food is great. Service is wonderful; yet a little slow. We really enjoy dining here and we love the tacos and bowls. [REVIEW_21] Well against my better judgement I went back to Freedom Smoke... I was in a bind and needed a tank so I called them first to find out if they had what I was after.   Brandon answered the phone and I explained that I wanted a Pro Tank because I had broken the threads off the base. He said he had some in stock; I then asked what the wait was like. He said they were pretty slow so I pressed on and asked if he thought I could get my tank and some juice in about fifteen minutes; he said more like ten. I was less than a mile away and when I pulled in it was more like 20 minutes just to get my order placed and another ten for my juice to come out. OMG!!! The only good thing to come out of this was they had the tank. The wait was ridiculous and to top it off the Starblast e juice was AWFUL!!!!  Will I finally learn??? [REVIEW_22] One of the worst customer service I have ever experienced at any Toyota service center! Twice in the past half year; I have had very poor customer service here. The first time was when I bought my car in specifically asking for an inspection of my right front tire; informing them it had been leaking air a few days ago and I had to pull over to get air pumped in. They found nothing... only 2 days later; that same tire went completely flat. I took my car to a local auto shop; and they found a huge nail stuck in the tire that would've been found if Toyota had done a careful inspection the first time.  Second experience was even worse and more shocking. I took my car in for servicing on a Saturday morning. The service person could not answer many of my questions; and when he stated that he was new; I kindly asked him how long he'd been working there (thinking that if he was so new that he didn't know a lot of info; that I'd ask another representative to help me). Out of nowhere; he yelled out in an extremely rude and angry manner;  ""That's none of your business ! ... I won't have you harrassing me..."" Everyone in the room was startled and turned around to see why he was shouting so loudly.  Perhaps he acted this way because there was no manager on duty; however; this behavior is customer service at its worst. As a person in the service industry myself (I am a physician and my patients' health; safety and satisfaction come first); I am shocked by his blatantly inappropriate and unacceptable behavior. This behavior reflects poorly on his company; and I hope nothing like this happens to any other customers in the future. I went to another shop to have my car serviced; where customers would be treated more politely and with respect. [REVIEW_23] horrible. in Everyway. coffee and food taste horrible. horrible service too. Hat trick of horrible. NO STARS. [REVIEW_24] Our stay here was fantastic. The rooms are very modern and spacious. The staff was very friendly in helping us with any questions. The rooms are very quiet and the beds are extremely comfortable. [REVIEW_25] This store was such a huge disappointment. We are new to Arizona; and I was excited to visit due to the great reviews. I went in search of kitschy SW décor; and I couldn't stay long. The entire store reeked of urine. It was more than my poor nose could handle. [REVIEW_26] I've been 3 times; so I think I can share a fair judgement.  This business is a lot of show; without the go.   Service has been the overall department that has been completely lacking along with some breakfast items are products of horrible cooking.  First time: asked for black coffee and a matcha latte; dad didn't get his coffee until our food already arrived (which also seemed to take forever) and I actually never received my matcha latte after asking and reminding waiters more than eight times; 8!!! It got to be comical; which is why we counted.  By the end of our breakfast they finally offered it to me in it as a to go drink and still had the audacity to charge me for it; so I said no.  Second visit; was dinner with friends; this was a much more pleasant experience; there was four of us; we shared a bottle of wine and I remember I liked my food. No complaints here. Third time; was another breakfast round... I'm not sure what it is about breakfast but I don't think they do a good job for breakfast. To start with; we were given menus for both breakfast and lunch; which was appreciated; but no drink menus and we were specifically interested in mimosas or Bloody Mary's etc. because we didn't know what to order; or what was our options were... my dad ordered a Bloody Mary; and I ordered a Mimosa. I only mention this because it was frustrating to see other people have different variations of mimosas and also bloody mary's; other breakfast cocktails which we didn't even know existed.  My dad ordered a ham and cheese omelette with his side of home fries. I ordered the power bowl muesli.  We got through two drinks before the food came; which actually was a long time. By the time our food came; the order was wrong - my dad had fruit; but no home fries as he requested.  We immediately let our server know; and she said she would go grab them.  Additionally; our plates were extremely bland.  Just an omelette; no garnish or sides at all (other than the fruit in the side bowl.  The plates just looked sad.  Also; I could tell by looking at the omelette it wasn't good; that's how bad it was; and my dad concurred.  The wait staff failed to bring his home fries in any kind of fast or quick manner; so we reminded our bartender; who then reminded to server; once my dad got a refill on his coffee we also then reminded that server as well.  We ate through the entire meal; never got the home fries; and in the end right as our check was being delivered we mentioned the homefries again; and that's when the bartender sent a server running for them; and as we were signing our check is when they came out and were offered as a ""to go"" option.  While a simple side; it was really disappointing to go the entire breakfast with an awkward feeling of  ""I guess they just don't care"" and instead of comping anything; the manager offered me a $15 off coupon the next time we came in.  It's just hard to ever want to come in again... and didn't feel like an adequate apology on a $45 breakfast.  And lastly my dads omelette tasted like McDonalds.  Only upside was that my muesli power bowl was delicious; just hard to believe it took as long as it did to come out or that anything cost as much as it did with as horrible of service and lack of ""care"" put behind anything that was done there. [REVIEW_27] Apartment is falling apart there is no insulation they don't repair anything. You can never get in touch with anyone the amenities are non existent there is no gate the pool is closed. The forced trash service sucks. Insects get in all the broken windows. They do anything to get you to move in and NOTHING to fix anything. You can hear your neighbors pee and everything else! Everyone has the same complaints it's crazy. We are trying to buy a house as soon as we find one we are out of here it's ridiculous. See pictures! Don't move here it's not worth it. [REVIEW_28] Service horrible. 3rd visit here hoping this place makes it since it's local; but I doubt it. When are they going to hire some experienced help that are not uninterested teenagers?  First two trips couldn't get bartender to acknowledge us without flagging down; tonight icing on the cake. Do not waste your time. Waitresses walking by; like.we were invisible. Got up; found waitress asked for service.....never came back. Owner made excuses. Sorry to see you go overpriced Craft House. [REVIEW_29] The drinks and the customer care are the only redeeming factor to this place. Not an authentic Mexican food- order chicken enchiladas without cheese or sourcream and the chicken was crunchy...like old rubber crunchy! Sent it back got beef tacos much better but the beans were super dry. The group said the beef was good. Probs wouldn't come back. [REVIEW_30] This is my favorite place to enjoy gelato in St. Louis.   Consider the...   Coffee house-like atmosphere.  Large outdoor patio with a fountain and surrounding foliage.  Delicious gelato and baked goods.   Yes; everything at Gelateria is pleasing.",8
68,"[REVIEW_1] Best iced latte and beignet we tried. The live music also creates a great atmosphere. We also visited Cafe du Monde but in our opinion Cafe Beignet is much better. The service is also very good and there are hardly ever lines. [REVIEW_2] Had lunch here for my birthday on October 7th and was not disappointed.  It was definitely one of the go to restaurants on this small pier and we really didn't have to wait that long to be seated. There was seating both outside and inside; but we decided to sit indoors since it was a bit windy and hot outside since we were literally in the ocean on the pier.  My boyfriend got us the shrimp cocktail salad and the 4lb (maybe it was 6lbs lolz) crab to share that was the special of the day. But out waiter had informed us that they ran out of the specific crab we wanted; but gave us two different crabs that was equivalent to the weight of the crab that we missed out on.  Once our food arrived; we dug right in. Everything tasted; so delicious and fresh. We finished off everything that we ordered and made sure not to leave any sort of crab meat morsel behind. The shrimp salad was surprisingly good. It was light and the shrimps were juicy. The crabs had their own different flavors and came with really crispy onion rings on the side and melted butter.   I definitely will come back here again cause pricey as it was we definitely got our monies worth! [REVIEW_3] I used to go to this salon about 7-8 years ago and I quit going because of how unprofessional it was run.  I recently decided to give it another try because of how convenient it is for me.  It has changed 100%.  I dont know what happened when they remodeled; but it is all good.  The place looks great and the staff is really on the ball.  Amy and Kate are both a  pleasure to work with and good at their job.  I even take my husband in for pedicures occasionally. I know everyone knows how hard it is to find a clean; professionally run nail salon.   This is one! [REVIEW_4] The cheddar fries are quite delicious and the service was exceptional. Come here if you want a chill time and some good food. [REVIEW_5] My husband and I love going to this sushi place at least 3 times a month. They work fast here and the prices are great. Their deep fried sushi is the best! And the service is friendly. They also always have many happy hour deals where there is free saki happening every week. [REVIEW_6] Excellent service; food; and price! If you want easy-going atmosphere like you had when you were a child  back in the day at grandma's house then this is the place to be! [REVIEW_7] Always a fun time! We came to see Pete Correale; and he was great! The first comedian to start the night off was not great; but the MC; second comic and the headliner were wonderful! Fast waitress when it came to our food and drinks; all in all a great night! [REVIEW_8] Everything about this place makes me SOOO happy. From the staff to the food to the patio - there are a few reasons why I have been here almost as many days I've been in Nashville. Keep it up y'all! [REVIEW_9] Came here with a coworker as she is a regular here and it definitely did not disappoint! I moved from NJ to PA and haven't been able to find a place I loved until today! They got me right in and paid a lot of attention to detail which I so appreciate. Facility is clean and welcoming and everyone here was absolutely amazing. They also have a TON of colors; and do sns powder! I will definitely be a regular from here on out! [REVIEW_10] Had a very memorable birthday in SB and was so happy to have Wine Edventures be my gift! Sean picked us up Saturday morning and was super friendly (funny; too). It was just my husband and I along with a group of 10 - who happened to be all guys; having a bachelor party! Haha; so that was pretty funny. We stopped at 3 wineries and 1 brewery. Sean explained where we were as we were driving around and also gave us lessons at the tastings. He provided us with bottled water and souvenir wine glasses. We had lunch at the 2nd vineyard of the day; which was very good - choice of sandwich and a pasta salad side with chips and a cookie (the cookies are awesome). It was a fun day and I'd highly recommend this adventure to anyone looking for a fun day in the SB area. [REVIEW_11] Rock Bottom has changed it's name to better fit their aspirations and goals. Heroes Dive Center; owned and operated by 21 year Army veteran Shawn Carroll and his business partner John Catalano with emphasis on making diving accessible to all an the share in the adventure. Please come in and visit and see why you would want to learn how to or expand your diving adventures with the team at Heroes Dive Center. [REVIEW_12] Love love love! This place!!!  We were in town visiting for my birthday weekend and winded up here after a wasted experience at Warm Daddys. There are so many good things to say I will break it down.  LOCATION: this place shares a parking lot with Longhorn Steakhouse so there are plenty of spaces. Its also near a best buy; etc so should you have to wait you can shop around. Although we didnt wait at all  LAYOUT: Being from baltimore; we wanted to watch the 1pm game a/g Pittsburgh. The Eagles game was at 4pm. There were PLENTY tvs all around to watch ANY football game you wanted. There are plenty of seats all of which you can view the TVs if you wanted with a bar area in the middle of the floor as well.  ATMOSPHERE: family friendly and clean! I especially liked the fact that during commericals for the main game; they played music and as soon as the game came back on the music stopped. This is atypical of some places; as they play music the whole time and you only can read the close captioning while watching the game.  DRINKS: Drink menus are very important to me. I like variety and boy did this place had it. They had various drink concoctions they put together that seemed very interesting! I had two of their different drinks and was not disappointed by either of them.  DESSERTS: Delish!!! My friend got the mile-high cake and wow!!! This stands at least 6 inches high with about 6 layers. For only $8; this fed the whole table!  APPETIZERS: DO NOT leave there without trying the crab bread; and that says alot for someone coming from Baltimore. There's also this special dipping sauce that comes with it? Exquisite!! I couldnt get enough. The spinach/artichoke appetizer was definitely a treat as well.  ENTREES: the fajitas are to die for; i had the cajun shrimp pasta which was good. The salmon was bland; but the bbq chicken sandwiches were great! A friend had grilled chicken greek salad and the chicken was plentiful.  Also for you health food nuts; all the nutritional facts are posted for EVERYTHING; even the drinks.  Next time I go back to Philly; i will be coming back. [REVIEW_13] We wanted Asian duck and were in the area; so we stopped in. Wow. The reviews from my fellow yelpers were spot on! The duck was amazing. We also had the pork and chicken- both amazing as well. The steamed shrimp dumplings were very tasty and for me- the general tso chicken took the cake! I have never tasted a general tso similar. This one is full of flavor. The initial taste is a bit sweet with a little tang. The after taste is smooth and spicy. Perfect dish! We did not try anything from the bakery; but it all looked good. We will be back very soon. [REVIEW_14] Great spot in the heart of the French Quarter. Do yourself a favor and don't consider ordering anything other than the BBQ shrimp. If you look up the recipe; it's shrimp that's DROWNING in a flavorful butter sauce and; as you'd expect; it's AMAZING. Worth a stop for lunch or dinner when you're in NOLA. [REVIEW_15] My new favorite ice cream spot! The Mexican Twinky is AMAZING! This will not be my last visit... They have water based as well as cream based - so if you want a guiltless treat; as my husband did; you can go with one of their fruit sorbets.  Our little girl got the strawberry cream and it was really good also- much better than your average strawberry ice cream! Staff was super friendly; and the store was very clean and bright.  Great spot! [REVIEW_16] This is not a typical goodwill store and it is Not an overpriced vintage clothing store either.  Sure; I may be a bit biased because I came in here looking for an affordable 2 piece suit; which I found right away!  Really nice suit that I tried on in a clean dressing room.  I just can't get over the fact that it fit so nicely and it was the only one I tried on.  The staff working here were very personable and helpful.  Did I mention it was clean?  Way better than other thrift stores I have been to.  The clothing racks were organized and it was easy to shop around.  The music was cool too.  I didn't even feel like I was shopping; not that I like to shop; but this store made it fun.  They have clean Men's and women's rest rooms.  They have accessories and plenty of other reasons to come back in.  Maybe a bit higher than goodwill; but not much and the extra quality is definitely here! [REVIEW_17] Dined here this past Friday night for dinner. The restaurant has a very casual feel to it. The food was delicious! We started with the complimentary garlic oil and garlic knots. What's not to like?  My friends and I split a salad and the fried risotto balls. Two of us ordered the chicken parm (delish) and my other friend ordered the steak which was also delicious. We shared a piece of cheesecake that melted in your mouth.  The portions are huge (that's what she said) :)  Our server Jenni was fantastic!  Accommodating; friendly and efficient!  Bocconcini is also BYOB which I love.  Would definitely recommend! [REVIEW_18] Update after initial review:  ordered again last night using the yelp eat24 app. Food was ready within 10 minutes of placing the order. I opted for pickup since I was on my way home. The app did not give them my correct phone # and speaking to the great staff at the reception desk they told me sometimes yelp gets the addresses wrong for delivery so my advice is to type your phone # and address (if using delivery) into the comments box just so you get your food as fast as they intend to get it to you.   This is the best place for sushi in the area. We have frequented other sushi places and this one by far stands above the rest. Was happy to see Saturday night was very busy for them; and my takeout was still ready in under 10 minutes!! [REVIEW_19] Finally warming up for yogurt!!! They have crepes here too! It's awesome come try them [REVIEW_20] Chocolate mint martini was amazing. Girlfriend had chocolate covered banana martini and loved it. We split the standing banana split and the home made Icecream is the best I have had [REVIEW_21] It really upsets me that Five Star pizza does NOT have five stars. Really great pizza. Do not get the cinnamon bite things. The pepperoni bites are super yummy. Their pizzas are very large and nicely priced. Always coupons/deals on their website when you order. Food is usually ready to be picked up in 20-30 minutes. Their staff sucks but just I ignore it. [REVIEW_22] I mean this in the most positive and reverent way when I say that some day at my funeral; the words that will be spoken in hushed tones by everyone; will be ;"" spicy peanut chocolate donut"". [REVIEW_23] Holy crow is this place fantastic!  Great balance of nice wines and beers on tap; with interesting and unique beer and cheese selections. I always take people here when I want to celebrate. The duck salad with a one of their lovely full bodied reds is just heaven. The salome plate is also great if you're looking to try a bunch of little things without breaking the bank.  I'm usually off put by the frufru places; but this place somehow manages to be frufru but casually welcoming at the same time? Yeah; it's mostly bougie yuppies here; but they made me; a kinda grungy 20-something hipster and my friends; feel fairly comfortable; considering the aforementioned bougie surroundings.   Overall a fantastic experience and; most importantly; totally and completely blown away by the food and drink. [REVIEW_24] Great Indian food! We received a basket of crispy crackers with four different chutneys to try as well as complimentary red pepper soup prior to our meal. My mango lassi was the perfect level of sweet and refreshing. My friend and I shared the palak paneer (and I'm looking forward to the leftovers tonight!) and the chicken shahi korma; a dish that was new to both of us...and there were no leftovers of that! It was wonderful. Both dishes were served with a side of basmati rice; and the attentive waiter offered to bring us more if we'd like. Excellent food; great value! I can't wait to try out the lunch buffet one day. [REVIEW_25] Extremely friendly and relaxed experience. Food was equally excellent. The Italian Beef sandwich just like Tony's Italian beefy's in Chicago. Pizza speaks for itself - outstanding. Ellie was our server and couldn't have been nicer. Well done folks! [REVIEW_26] What a great place for breakfast!! Healthy options that are yummy; other options that LOOK yummy!! We love the atmosphere; service and food. [REVIEW_27] Great wings and atmosphere!! Gone quite a few times and have received consistently great service; beer; and food. [REVIEW_28] Love this Rouses! The store is always immaculately clean (which is a huge plus for me); and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  The prices can be a bit high sometimes; so I don't go there for my 'big' grocery trips; but I do stop in a few times a week for things I run out of or forget.  Additionally; the hot bar; salad bar; and ready made meals are a go to for a quick but tasty lunch.  One thing that stands out is if the store doesn't have something;  they can order it and call you when it's in. One of the employees in the frozen foods section named Alton was extremely helpful in getting a hard to find item ordered for me and personally called me when it was in. Amazing customer service! [REVIEW_29] Just came through here this past weekend for some carryout. Again - Great food and service.  My favorite local Chinese restaurant. [REVIEW_30] Always fresh and fast; once you taste these it ruins the other places for you. Going back to a Starbucks; Dunkin; or grocery store bagel is just not an option.  All the cream cheese flavors are mixed fresh in the store. The veggie cream cheese is awesome! The owner is also charitable and frequently provides local nonprofits with end of the day bagels. It bears mentioning that he does so because everything is made fresh each morning so there are no carryovers.",30
69,"[REVIEW_1] AMAZING food. Make sure you make a reservation for the weekends. This is a BYOB and the wait is worth it. Their pastas are sooooooooo good. I LOVE the gnocchi Fellini but I get it w/ Linguini. One plate of pasta will fill up two people w/ leftovers. [REVIEW_2] Amazing place for good fun. Got engaged last night and brought my now fiance with me to the n crowd. Asked if they could do a little shout out for her. Not only did they do a shout out they did a skit renacting her entire day. Was hilarious and really made the night extra special. Highly recommend the N Crowd to anyone who likes to laugh and have fun. A++++++ [REVIEW_3] El Tequila is one the best Mexican restaurants; it's a quaint place; very clean; and the food is absolutely delicious.  I always get their chimichanga .. my favorite:) and their guacamole is awesome! Prices are good; location is convenient; and I can't say enough about the food. [REVIEW_4] Super cute local coffee joint; very good coffee. I got a speedball which was 2 espresso shots in a cup of coffee. My friend I was with got a nitro coffee which was also very good. [REVIEW_5] I stopped by Bell Meade during a recent visit to Nashville. The best way for me to describe my experience is to say that the next time I go to Nashville I will go out of my way to make sure I return to Bell Meade.  On my travels; I tend to stop from time to time to see if I can find specific bourbons that may be out locally. At this time of year; I did not expect any great finds because many of the items for which I look have their annual release later in the year so it's a surprise to find any of them on the shelf. For example; Elmer T Lee is a favorite of mine so it was one that I asked about.  Despite the fact that I walked away without Elmer T; I still had a great time. I enjoyed a few tastes at the tasting bar and even better I had a great conversation with Max. He is one of the reasons I will return.  I did walk out with a bottle of Tennessee whiskey cream that is not sold locally and there was a bottle on the shelf that I have not seen locally that I need to investigate. As I said I will return and a five star rating from me should say at all. [REVIEW_6] Henry's is the kind of place you want to keep to yourself; for fear of it becoming so crowded you can't ever find a seat!   Great atmosphere; great coffee; great service - beats SBucks by a mile.  I like to go by myself and people watch or go with a friend to play scrabble and chit chat.  The food is excellent as well so its a great stop for lunch or an after dinner  treat.  Highly rec'd! [REVIEW_7] I found Bella Prana by recommendation from a friend who LOVES the studio. Knowing my background as a yoga instructor in Los Angeles she knew I would love this place.  She was right! I have practiced with some of the top instructors in the world and taken yoga at the top yoga studios in New York and Los Angeles as well as doing three yoga teacher trainings with top studios like Yoga Works. This studio definitely meets my needs and reminds me of the large studios I use to practice with in L.A. It is such a wonderful vibe; amazing front desk staff who are very helpful; classes for every level; intelligent sequenceing ( which is important to avoid injury) and lovely teachers. I love Marley she has such  great energy and a caring heart. There are two showers and amenities when you come out after a hot sweaty workout. I took my boyfriend to a special workshop Roni was hosting and he walked out drenched and completely ZENed out! They have lots of workshops; a book club and a teacher training! They are even taking people to India for a retreat; which would be a dream to go to; next time!   All in all an amazing studio; I don't miss my big city studios when going here; a great place to practice! [REVIEW_8] Awesome thin crust. Nice spot You won't find a better pizza in Philly  Great food; salad bar; fresh fruit  Gourmet slices  Fantastic food and large dining area with TV.  This is legit 5-star [REVIEW_9] As another reviewer pointed out the pork chop entree is pretty amazing. Actually probably one of the best I have had ANYWHERE that I've been. Everything on the plate tastes good and it all goes together perfectly. I will be going back just to get that every time probably. I want to try something else but the pork chop entree is so good not sure I even care to. Had the corn bread for an appetizer. It was pretty good and the apple butter that came with it was delicious. Can't wait to go back. [REVIEW_10] Neil and the crew down at Gardens Of Babylon are incredible! The go extremely out of their way to help answer questions; offer organic gardening techniques; outsource supplies for projects... The list goes on. Having them on-site was another great experience! They were able to get a better grasp of what my landscapes conditions were... Which is challenging (too much pooling water; no sunlight). They go above and beyond to make sure that I stay under budget but to also make sure what will and will not work to ensure a long lasting beautiful landscape. I'd recommend these guys until I was blue in the face. A+++ [REVIEW_11] Big store; decent selection; plenty of parking and rather convenient location. The building is well lit; Items are always stocked; and if you have trouble finding anything - employees aren't far to ask. Everyone seems in a positive mood; happy to greet you and happy to help. I am a big fan of the fresh squeezed juice; their sandwiches; and all the snacks you can buy! I don't do my regular weekly shopping here but I still stop in frequently and pick up a thing here and there when I need or have a want for it. I have no complaints about this location! It's wonderful! [REVIEW_12] Very honest; gave me right estimate. Fixed oil leak and never had problem again. [REVIEW_13] Todd really takes the time to make sure he is doing what is right for your body. He is a great Chiropractor and has special student rates which I greatly appreciate. I highly recommend Peak Performance! [REVIEW_14] Thanks to yelp for helping us find this place!  It was amazing!!!  The food was delicious and the atmosphere perfect.  I had biscuits and gravy - so yummy!!  My husband had eggs; bacon and cheesy grits...  to die for!  When we are back in the area we will definitely return here. [REVIEW_15] One of my all time favorite breakfast spots anywhere! The vegetarian sausage and egg biscuits are so freakin good and like lots else on them menu- nap inducing. Great homemade food and desserts. Diner style with fast service and a long wait that's worth it. Get there as soon as they open for shorter wait. Lunch options are also good. [REVIEW_16] After hearing about this place from a fellow Yelp Elite; my SO and I decided to try this place! We were warned of possible waiting times so came here on a Saturday around 10:45; and a line was already forming!   For apps; we ordered the takoyaki and fried octopus. The takoyaki are delicious-an order comes with 5 balls that were perfectly cooked and topped with sauces. Takoyaki are little circular doughs with squid in the middle; topped with sauces and squid flakes (?). I definitely recommend this app. As for the fried octopus; it was just fried without sauces on top and came with mayo on the side; but it didn't come with enough mayo to dip the octopus in.  For ramen; I got the red spicy tonkotsu ramen and my SO got the black garlic tonkotsu ramen. For both ramen; the thin noodles were mushy/overcooked and just didn't quite fit with the ramen. That was the flaw with the dishes; and it tasted like the noodles were overcooked in a pot of flour-y water so it wasn't as clean (which explains the mushy feeling). They should use more bouncy noodles for this.  Now let's talk about the broth. The broth is flavorful; but the red chili broth was a bit too spicy for me and covered up the depth of the broth. I prefer the black garlic tonkotsu broth for that reason.  Overall; delicious food and pricing is reasonable. The decor is very nice as well; but screaming kids that were running around didn't make our meal pleasant. [REVIEW_17] Bought my beautiful new bike from this shop a few weeks ago then promptly crashed it (curse you; trolley tracks!). I brought it back to the shop this afternoon to see if there was any way they could try to fix the front basket; which was pretty mangled; and to give the bike a once-over to make sure it was safe to ride. I was expecting to have to leave the bike with them for a few days; but the whole process took less than a half hour. Not only did they fix the basket (not perfect; but pretty damn close); but they also fixed the gear shifter that was a little out of whack... FOR FREE.  I couldn't believe it.   I also want to note that everyone in the shop- from the owners; to the sales people on the floor; to the mechanics; to the dog that greets you at the door- is so friendly and welcoming. I am so happy I found them. [REVIEW_18] I want to start out by saying that I have taken his class twice! And I'm 15  FOOD The food was delicious! I am not a picky eater; in fact I am a total foodie; so I do like my food to be gourmet! This food was gourmet! I learned; and did things I was scared to do; and that I am great full for! For example; I love soft shell crab; now I know how to clean one! Not to mention all the really yummy sauces that I now know how to make!   CUSTOMER SERVICE I found his hospitality very southern! It gave me the feeling like ""y'all are family"". And that factor is added to because the cooking class does take place in his home! And another plus; IT'S AIR CONDITIONED WELL! Which in the south is very important! And he also picked us up from they ferry so we didn't have to walk in the very hot sun.   AMBIANCE Southern. That's all I can say   EDUCATION   I learned a lot about southern cooking and these are kinds of things that I will take with me!   TO LONG TO READ THE WHOLE REVEIW?  So in a nutshell! I had a great time! The only thing I will tell you is that IF YOU ARE TRYING TO MAINTAIN A DIET DON'T COME HERE BECAUSE ITS ALL ABOUT BUTTER (sometimes; depending on the class you take) [REVIEW_19] I have been to this restaurant several times when I am in town. Sometimes; I will make my way from LA or San Diego just to stop by the beach and Thai food. I'm Thai and it's hard to find a good Thai restaurant to my standard. The quality of food is higher than many Thai restaurants I've been to. My favorite dish is Seafood Spicy fried Noodle! I enjoy New Zealand Mussels; shrimps and they throw crab claws in this dish. It's fancy and delicious! Staff always work so hard to get customers in and out quickly. Friday and Saturday are always packed. The service is fast and excellent. I highly recommend Siam Elephant and it always is my favorite Thai restaurant. [REVIEW_20] This update (and upgrade) to my review of Khyber is long overdue!  I think the most ringing summary is that I have since moved ~1 mile further away from the Khyber; and I still go there just as often.  I have now sampled most of the menu; but the truly excellent Southern barbecue is what usually calls to me.  You can't go wrong whether you pick the brisket; the ribs; the chicken; the pulled pork or a combo of the above.  Their mac and cheese remains my favorite side; and the addition of the very good coleslaw rounds out the experience.  I love the vibe of Kyber.  It usually pretty full; but they usually seem to have a table available for me (Yay!).  It is often loud; but never quite so loud that I wish it were quieter.  The staff is very knowledgeable; and happy to provide beer recommendations and taste tests of drafts.  They Khyber also manages to hit that sweet spot where I never end up being the most or least intoxicated person there! [REVIEW_21] I like everything. I love the ramen noodles here. They are pretty good but i don't see much people come there. Prob they need to advertise more or do something to make more people come to eat. [REVIEW_22] I really wanted to like this place. I do not.   There were a lot of problems with the service. We were told that there was a thirty minute wait. The problem; however; was not that they were too busy; it's that it takes 15 minutes for anyone to bus a table. I saw 3 employees walk by a table that needed bussing without grabbing anything.   After we were seated; our waitress forgot just about everything we asked for. It took twenty minutes to get the check. Other tables had similar problems. A couple sitting at the bar were told the kitchen lost their order. That's it--no apology; nothing. Oddly enough; the manager and our waitress kept high-fiving and referring to each other as rock stars.   The long wait built up our anticipation of the food. Unfortunately; the food was a let down. Everything was under-seasoned and bland.   All in all; lunch took an hour and a half; and cost $45.00 for two. I normally don't write negative reviews; but I can't help feeling like I got ripped off. [REVIEW_23] The piano players here are awesome. We loved them. They can play anything! The drinks are fairly priced and the $5 cover was totally worth it. [REVIEW_24] Super cute place! Employees are very nice! Cookie dough is delicious! This is a must & we are glad we found it (lost while in town). [REVIEW_25] Delicious; tasty; very competitive (formula with 2 starters+1 entree for 15$. Adorable service; the best coconut icecream i had ever. Do not hesitate. [REVIEW_26] The service was great and the food was good too. I didn't want soup with my grilled cheese since it was such a hot day...so they made me a second grilled cheese!  I didn't try the coffee but had a couple of the smoothies (PB&J; Island Espresso) which were really tasty.   The atmosphere is good-open space-makes it feel larger than it is. And there is a tiny puppy chilling here too. [REVIEW_27] Ordered pizza and tipped a buck. Made wrong pizza...waited...made another wrong pizza...girl talked to manager and walked into back room with pizza and suddenly came out with the right sauce and already had cheese already on it. Don't know what happened in the back room but I thought they were supposed to make it in front of you. Then they treated me like I was the asshole. [REVIEW_28] LOVE chiptole- all locations! this location had great customer service and the food is siesta on point! [REVIEW_29] For some reason in high school we would all loiter disreputably outside the courthouse after school.  I don't know why we chose the courthouse as a good place to look like we were going to do some crimes.   Probably because they got a nice lawn. [REVIEW_30] Oh; Heck No! We ordered 2 pizzas tonight: one new hand tossed and one thin and crispy. And I do use the word crispy lightly. Both these pizzas were limp and soggy. When we lifted the pieces from the boxes the tips pointed straight down at the table--and not because of the weight of the ingredients. Those were just ordinary. But; this thin and ""crispy"" crust was very crispy on the very outer edge; but wallpaper paste everywhere else. The hand tossed is a new product and I thought maybe they just hadn't gotten it perfected yet. It also was soggy and did a nose-dive to the table when lifted. Unfortunately; it was already after nine pm when they arrived and we decided to just eat what we could and call it a night. But; I thought about it and decided that maybe they didn't know and if everyone was silent; they would lose business and people would have bad experiences. So; I called and spoke to David; who identified himself as the manager on duty. I told him we had gotten pizza and that I just wanted to give him some feedback. He was very nice; polite and pleasant. I liked him. Until. Until he said that he had pulled up my order and that there were 6 toppings on one pizza and 9 toppings on the other pizza and so with so many toppings; it's hard for them to know how long to cook the pizzas. I thought about that a second and asked; ""so it's my fault for ordering too many toppings""? He said no and then explained again that with that many toppings it's too hard to judge how long to cook the pizzas. I told him then it should say on the website (I ordered online) that they don't recommend more than however-many toppings. He explained the problem to me again and I told him Dominos can cook a crispy pizza crust perfectly--and do a pretty good hand tossed; too. I said maybe I should call them and find out how to do it and call him back and tell him. I mean; how ridiculous! I asked for nothing comped; nothing like that. I was just giving the feedback and ended up being a bit flip with him and sitting here typing this because I'm mad instead of sleeping. With delivery and tip; I paid $30 for food that was barely eaten and will probably be thrown away in a few days. It'll dry out in the refrigerator; so maybe I can have it crispy after all. What idiocy.  I told him the Yelp review would be up in about an hour; so ""Hi; David!"" and I contacted corporate; too.",27
70,"[REVIEW_1] We love Philly and go every New Years Eve. We have experienced many hotels in the area ... this by far was our worst. The location is ok; not great. Their are some restaurants ( El Rey; continental) within walking distance. (walking distance to us is 5-10 blocks). The parking is $36 a day. The valet was polite and did there jobs. Front desk was nice and did there jobs as well. No issues with the staff. The lobby is misleading.The room size is average but the bathrooms are small and nonfunctional. The bed sucks no polite way to say it; first night I was up every hour due to the discomfort. REQUEST extra pillows! Was not super clean either in the bathroom. The rooms are not sound proff!!!! We could hear a couple fighting on top of us. To the point where we had to go to the lobby because we thought he was killing her. We could hear full conversations. Now this also explains the people who frequant the hotel.  This point is even more illistrate by the fact when we brought the fight to the attention of the staff they were not phased. I know it was New Years but listening to a girl getting choked out was not a good time actually it was a buzz kill. So we will never stay here again. [REVIEW_2] Lots of great beer! Yum yum! Neat 'feel' to this place. We ended up arriving just before a tarential downpour; so we couldn't sit outside; but they have lots of outdoor seating if you can stand the heat/humidity. Staff very nice. I rarely give 5 starts; but i just enjoyed this place so much.... Lots of 'locals' playing board games and cards. An over all great place for drink. They even have a few wine choices. [REVIEW_3] Restaurant was totally empty for lunch today and hostess refused to seat my wife and child for lunch; saying the tables were all reserved.  What a joke.  Good business idea [REVIEW_4] The order process for the drive through is a complete failure and waste of time. Currently 4 out of four for not getting the order correct. Missing items every time. Too much playtime in there with the kids. This restaurant performs horrible compared to others. After my complaint; they even admitted it. Visit during the week around 3pm. Continuous failure!!! [REVIEW_5] expensive; bad food and service. I have been to other corner bakery cafes; and I usually like them; but I tend to get terrible service at this one. These problems manifests as long waits for meals even during slow times; and getting orders wrong. The last time (never again) I went in it was a slow morning; and it took them 45 minutes to get me my eggs; and when they came they were cold. I informed the cashier that my eggs were cold and I asked him if they could make me new eggs.  He said yes; and took my eggs.  He came back out with my same plate; and it was evident that he microwaved the plate with the toast and fruit on it; the toast was soggy; and fruit warm. I returned my food; and have vowed to never return. [REVIEW_6] I am a torta torta man!!  I like the crispy bread oh yeah.  And I will write no more lyrics.  I have been here three times now and every time has been solid.  I have been slightly inactive on yelp and I am dusting off my yelp chops with a few reviews.    First time I had there lunch taco specials.  Really tasty; portions are nicely sized.  It is a realistic amount to eat for lunch.  The food is fresh and really taste.  However the next two times I had the fish torta lunch special.  That is the rub my friends.  It is a great value for a huge piece of nicely cooked fish with some really tasty golden potatoes.   I would recommend trying one.  Also this place is really well decorated.  A really great aesthetic.  Only minuses can be a bit on the noisy side when it is crowded; and the chairs / benches are wicked on the butt. [REVIEW_7] The diner was extremely busy and the waitresses were being pushed to their limits.  The problem was the kitchen; obviously; when the food came it was dry and overdone; the sides came later; the desert was not cooked(rice pudding).  The waitress did offer another choice and we will see how that is later as after being there over 1 hr we brought home.  The owners or managers only seem to care if a substitute was made and who was your server but not that the kitchen staff is being overworked with this crowd and cannot be attentive to their cooking when being pushed like this.  The first manager pushed me to second manager and they really don't seem to care as long as they can push the crowd to fill the tables.  A few waitresses heard my complaints and thanked me as they said they have been trying to tell them this too.  Well; that is my last visit here as I would rather go up the street to a smaller diner (Club Diner) and get a better meal and more attentive staff. [REVIEW_8] Maybe this is the place to go for dinner; but apparently not for lunch!  My coworkers and I sat down to order right around 1 pm and did not get our food until 1:45!!!  Completely unacceptable; considering we only had an hour for lunch & we were the only 4 customers in the place!!!!  We immediately had to pay our bills and put our food directly into to-go boxes...which is not awesome when you order the home made fries; and they become soggy on the ride back to work.  My burger was delicious (once I got a break at the office to actually take a bite). The server was pretty unapologetic about the whole situation; and I really felt like we were a huge inconvenience for him.  If there hadn't been upbeat; Latin music playing throughout the restaurant; I would have mistaken this place for the waiting room at my gynecologist's office....no fun! [REVIEW_9] My fault for falling for the $6.99/lb filet (or maybe another cut; it was a month ago and I can't remember that specifically) and buying 2 (one for me; one for fiance).  Shame on me for not cooking it on the day I bought it; apparently.  Because when I DID go to cook it the next day (yes; that's right) it had turned brown and smelled awful.  Note that the other items in my fridge were fine (including other raw meat); so I suspect this was on its last legs when I purchased it.  Did I worry about being able to return it?  No...I go in there all the time (laziness and convenience) and in fact had been there 4 times that weekend because I was baking something and kept forgetting key ingredients.   So I went in; without my receipt; to ask if I could exchange it for a fresher piece of meat (I really had my heart set on steak).  Tito; the manager; gave me a super hard time about not having the receipt...I explained that I'm not used to having to keep the receipt in case the food I bought was SPOILED; but he didn't care.  He then proceeded to tell me that maybe it was my fridge; that I really needed to receipt; and to generally balk at my attempt to politely receive a refund or new steak.  Finally; he gave in and I got 2 new steaks; but that wasn't the end.  He stopped me to inspect them on my way out and started saying again how he thought I had either left them in my fridge; or my fridge was broken.  I commented that if I had the same issue at DiBruno Brothers; I wouldn't be put through this grief; to which he responded; ""Well; we aren't DiBruno Brothers"".  No shit.  I emailed them and commented and of course heard no response.  I really wish that the little grocery at 20th and Spruce was better stocked; because I this place blows and I don't enjoy going there.  GAH! [REVIEW_10] Worst concert experience I've had. Buyers; beware. They're only interested in your money NOT your experience. My husband spent A LOT of money on an Imagine Dragons VIP package and it left much to be desired. The ""gift bag"" was filled with a small; cheap crumpled poster; plastic sunglasses; a pop socket; and a phone charger fit for a circa 2015 android. The ""crowd free shopping"" consisted of about 200 people crammed in a small area with general admission goers; and the ""hassle free entry"" took 45 minute. So; all in all I sit here really pissed about the experience; feeling bad for my husband who wanted to surprise; and the concert hasn't even started yet. Bravo CID. Thank you for seriously putting a damper on my night. [REVIEW_11] My fiance and I both visited this restaurant separately a few years ago; and neither of us enjoyed it.  Yesterday; we thought we'd try it again; together.  We walked in the restaurant and were seated at a table by the bar immediately.  There were two people at the bar and two other tables seated.  The host (may have also been our server) asked us what we wanted to drink.  Ten minutes later; the same man came back to our table; told us he had a ""brain fart"" and forgot what we ordered to drink.  We politely gave him our drink order again; and after at least five more minutes; we still hadn't seen him again; and we left.  The bartender; who walked past us at least 3 times; was at the bar on her IPad about 3 feet away from us when we walked out.  We gave them a second chance; and we won't be back.  We each have at least 20 years of restaurant experience; so we understand what service should be; and there are too many other choices to give this place another shot. [REVIEW_12] I would like to share my experience with the owner of this nail salon. I came in today for a manicure and pedicure. The sign on the door says hot spa pedicures. My water in pedicure and manicure was cold. My nail tech was talking very loudly the entire time; which made it very un-relaxing to me. She was very rough with the pedicure massage and in a very big hurry. Again; not relaxing at all. You advertise a relaxing spa like atmosphere on yoru website and that is not what is provided. When it came time to paint my nails; she missed part of my nails. I have photos of this if you would like to see them. She did not even paint the whole nail and skipped the side. I also asked her to clip down my nails and they are extremely crooked and none of them are the same shape. Instead of asking me if I wanted square or rounded nails; she just clipped of the corners and now I am missing corners on different nails. Her customer service and paint/shaping skills were TERRIBLE! She did not ask me if I liked my nails. She did not come to see if they were dry so I could leave. She did not take my payment. She disappeared into the back and someone else took my payment. Other customers in your salon had an unhappy look on their face. I will not be returning to your salon and you have lost a customer over her very poor work. I do look at getting my nails done as pampering myself; and I should not be treated like this when I am spending my hard earned money on a relaxing nail service that should look good. My nails are now ruined and I have to wait on then to grow out so another salon can fix what she did to me. I will be sharing my experience with all of my friends. [REVIEW_13] The only reason I came here was because there was a great deal for an oil change on Groupon. I bought it and booked the appointment online for the next day. So far; loving the experience. I show up at 3 pm for my scheduled appointment. I'm told that it will be an extra 15 minutes because they need to make a special order for my oil filter. I overhear one employee say to another; ""I was about to order that yesterday; but you know; people tend to not show up for their appointments; so I didn't order it."" She then apologized. To the other employee. Not to me. One hour later (not 15 minutes later); a guy walks in and announces he has the oil filter. Now they can start doing the oil change; rather than an hour ago at the actual time of my appointment. Thank you for wasting the last hour of my life; Sears. [REVIEW_14] Horrible!  I called to order an item and to insure I would be able to receive it the next day; which I agreed to pay for overnight shipping. I was told that it was pulled and ready to ship out for next day delivery. I was told that I would receive an email with this information the same day. Upon my 3rd call to get this information I was told that it was shipped ground and would receive it in 3 days. Mind you it is being shipped from Indianapolis and I live in Chicago. Will never buy from them again. [REVIEW_15] I usually love going to this t-mobile. The representatives are always so nice and helpful but today; the girl there gave me nothing but attitude when I asked about the new iPhone. Maybe she was having a bad day or whatever but she should be in a better mood when she talks to her customers. [REVIEW_16] Amber tried to give us old fries and weren't having it. Cold and burnt; we are not the ones. Get it together. [REVIEW_17] Rude; inattentive; uneducated and they always make you feel that you are bothering them. I have started using mobile order because it's one less idiot to deal within the chain. When they start making $15 an hour we will be ordering from kiosks and maybe dealing with one person. [REVIEW_18] We had a really good experience with northeast auto. They were able to get us taken care of the day we stopped in and they were fast and efficient. The mechanics were really nice and informative! I'd definitely go there again if I have car trouble. [REVIEW_19] This hotel was nasty. There are termites and ants crawling out of the floor and up the wall in droves outside our room door. Don't stay here. I uploaded a couple of pics of the bugs outside our door. So gross. [REVIEW_20] If you are thinking of staying here for a wedding night; DO NOT!! I have stayed at many other Embassy Suites over the years and have always had a great stay. This happened to be a very different stay. From the check in when my daughter told them it was her wedding weekend and the response was ""Oh"". The housekeeping staff never cleaned the room so the wedding night was an unmade bed with no clean towels. Bellman never showed up to help with bags so the wedding party all dressed in long dresses had to handle the cart and take care of the brides dress. The whole experience from each department failed. Valet was slow and they weren't about to help with the bags or help anyone into the car until $20 came out. We were late to the wedding because of the staffs inadequacies. Stay at the Marriot across the street. They are more accommodating. [REVIEW_21] $150 admin fee and $40 a month for a tiny gym that is barely ever open? No thanks. [REVIEW_22] We ate in. Awful pizza.  Shared the Philly steak pizza with bacon on the side.  Pizza was oily and soggy with little sauce and no flavor. Got sauce on the side and it was so watery as to be a liability.  Bacon was just heated bacon bits (worst I ever had) with no taste but lots more grease.  We were the ONLY customers eating in the entire time. Only sound was the overloud music.  Waiter was just one of the kitchen workers who was; however; very accommodating when he was available.  If you decide to go; I wish you much better luck.  Rating on pizza = minus 2.5 [REVIEW_23] I visited Just Cookies to get some chocolate chip cookies for a friend and I before a concert at the (awesome) Murat.  Specialty bakeries are the best; unfortunately; this place was the worst.  For cookies at this price; they should be better than the discount day-old cookies at the supermarket..  much better; even!  But these were; somehow; worse.  Not just dry; but bland.  I couldn't believe that a bakery specializing on just one item could do them so poorly.  And while the woman was not explicitly rude; she certainly wasn't friendly either (not even a smile.)  To Just Cookies; I'll Just say No! [REVIEW_24] The tomato soup was great.  But my pizza...wow. So. Bad. It was soggy and the crust was squishy. I could have rung it out like a dish rag. So gross. [REVIEW_25] Customers beware! If there was a way to give this business zero stars- that is how I would rate it. There is a huge banner on this location that says it is under new management because of the horrible reputation that it has. To say that they ripped me off would be an understatement. I took my Ford diesel truck in because it was close by when my engine started smoking. Biggest mistake of my life. They kept my truck for over a month- sold me used parts and charged me as if they were new parts. Charged my bank card unauthorized charges and to top it off; after paying over $7;800.00 my truck still wasn't working. I finally took it to the Ford dealer where they documented everything that was wrong with my truck and even confirmed that the wrong type of USED turbo was put on my truck. The manager Ray at the time was also just on channel 13 news because he was arrested for doing this to other customers. Seems like Midas transferred him to another location after too many complaints. I will be contacting a lawyer and the District Attorneys office.   I should also mention that during this process Ray hired me to do Landscaping upgrades to the business and I never received payment. This is not a place that you can trust. [REVIEW_26] I know I shouldn't expect much but everything I asked for that was on the drive thru menu was not available. I was actually afraid of what I was going to get once I did get it. I saw the movie ""waiting"".  Word of advice stay clear of this arch. Just so you know I was only trying to order a beverage how pathetic is that. [REVIEW_27] This was my second time going  First time service was very slow; Because it's new ;I let that pass 2nd time 11/30/14  There was hair in our food and not one but 4 plates Inexcusable !!! I will not return [REVIEW_28] The staff is friendly and polite; the shop is always clean. Got my bellybutton pierced 2 weeks ago and have been gone back twice to get it looked at and the piercer has been more than patient with me. [REVIEW_29] It pains me to rate anyone a single star; but I really was disappointed with my meal at Market Grill last night and won't be back.    We; a three-some; went on the recommendation of an acquaintance.  First impression walking in the door; smoke-free (yay!) and beautiful original brickwork; but a really scrubbed-clean feeling.  Which is good; or could be.  Maybe it just felt out of place in Soulard :).    From there it was all downhill.  The menus we were given were dog-eared; ripped; with pen marks and spots of indeterminable provenance.  Poor impression.  Print some new menus.    We were not offered a drink list.  When I asked for the drink list; the server said; ""We don't have a drink list; but I can get you a wine menu.""  But there is a neon Bud Light sign in the window.  If you don't have a list printed; use your voice and tell me what you offer.  A note on the wine menu: sorted into reds and whites.  Fair enough.  Beneath the reds?  The whites.  And beneath the whites?  The reds.  Print some new menus.  And considering the venue; their wine pricing is high.  The server made no effort to sell us drinks.    The food.  The first thing the server told us was that they were out of the soup of the day.  Ok; fine; benefit of the doubt; it must have been excellent and super-popular; right?  We started with hummus - not my choice.  Did not meet expectations.  I ordered meatloaf.  It was surprisingly dense and rather dry - full of filler.  The mashed potatoes looked more like mashed hash browns; I don't quite know how to describe them.  The green beans had to have come from a freezer bag.  And the fried onion & jalapeno straws were completely out of place on the plate.  I probably left half of my food behind; I could have done better at home.    One of my friends ordered a wrap he seemed to enjoy; the other ordered the special - they serve prime rib Saturday evenings.  She found it under-done but it looked right to me.  For some reason we thought we might need an order of the mac and cheese.  Friends; if your mother ever made you mac and cheese; this will be a disappointment.    My glass of wine was empty for; I don't know; a good half an hour.  The server never noticed.    The facilities in the handicap bathroom I realize must have been built to code but anyone paying attention will notice that the soap dispenser; mirror; and towel dispenser are unsuitably high for someone sitting in a wheelchair.    I wish Market Grill all the best; someone has put a lot of love into the building and is trying to make it as an entrepreneur; and I appreciate that.  But they need some serious focus and refinement on the menu concept and design and a reboot on the service. [REVIEW_30] Specifically came to the mall to get my brows done before a trip out of town and I walked in and stood there for two minutes until someone poked their head out of the back with two children and said they were on lunch break...was told to come back in 45 minutes. It was extremely unprofessional. No sign to indicate they were closed or anything! I will not be coming back.",4
71,"[REVIEW_1] This place made me want to move to Boise. Everyone was very friendly; and the space is beyond cool. Also a great selection of beers from the NW. [REVIEW_2] Staff is friendly. Walters trio enchiladas where terrible and the rice was uncooked; gross. My friends liked the mahi mahi and juicy Lucy burger. [REVIEW_3] Horrible;  they have a scary mascot that scared my grandson and I asked him twice and my waitress for him not to come to our table.  Did he listen NO;kept coming back! Also served  a drink with a big crack! We will never return [REVIEW_4] Nice place; some poor employees. Feel bad for the way their customers are treated. Being in the business; would never want any customer to experience the nasty attitude of this bartender. [REVIEW_5] disappointed that they wouldn't fill my dogfish head growlers and the beer itself wasn't memorable. [REVIEW_6] Favorite thing about Mel's: nobody outside of Manayunk or Roxy knows about Mels. This is a TINY shack of a place that can hold maybe 15 people at a time on Umbria; which is a street with lots of older rowhomes and industrial/warehouse type buildings. Don't let the appearance put you off. It's divey; but good diners often are. It's cheap; and the food is fantastic. I get the veggie omelette (no cheese; and they have no problem accommodating requests for what goes in stuff... the cook is 5 feet from you and talks to you herself!); because the mushrooms and spinach are AMAZINGLY TASTY. I think they simmer them in wine or something.  The wait staff is super attentive and friendly; even for the neighborhood. Love; love Mel's.  There's a parking lot outside for free; and tons of street parking if that fills up. [REVIEW_7] Waited 1 hour for a simple salad. This place takes forever to bring out your food! The service is slow and horrible.  I had to ask for my salad to go since I had a plane to catch.  When I was able to finally eat my salad; they forgot to put a side of salad dressing; needless to say my salad was awful!  There are plenty of other restaurants you can go to; don't waste your precious time and hard earned money on this dump! [REVIEW_8] $1.00 any draft beer until 10; are you kidding me!!! (Pretty damn good selection if I do say so) [REVIEW_9] Top 10 worst restaurant experiences of all time!  Stopped in for lunch this Sunday afternoon. I had seen the reviews about bad service here but was driving and figured WTH; let me give it a try. I am sorry i did.   I walk in and the toothpick chewing attendant is sitting on a stool. Sees me but continues to play with his phone. After an awkward 2 min staring contest motions me to 'sit where ever' wave. Brings over a cracked plastic glass with his palm covering and touching the rim of my glass and warm pitcher of water. Ordered boneless Chicken Korma was brought out by a waiter in a small cereal bowl with another small cereal bowl of microwaved rice in which we had his thumb. I wanted to walk out but honestly felt sorry for the guy given the restaurant only had one other party of three dinning on a Sunday Afternoon. Food was horriable. Instead of Chicken Korma i was given what tasted like Chicken Makhni curry over spiced and over salted to look like Chicken Korma. Waiter disappears and emerged with three fingers on a plate plopped it down and disappeared forever. I ate about a quarter of the meal and literally felt like throwing up. The meat was a mixture of white and dark meat left over from thigh or other parts (was odd shaped and some was shredded). Rice quality was good but it was tortured dry in a microwave before it was served. Asked for check. Paid and then told the attendant that i was sorry but meal was not that good. His reply ""Okay...thanks....""   For what i got and what i paid ($13) it was not only a rip off but an insult. Not once did ANYONE come over to ask if everything was ok. Rocky tables were stabilized with folded paper napkins; napkin holders on all tables are MIA. Napkins are just piled on a table with salt shakers to hold them down. How much are plastic glass and napkin holders at Ikea or Restaurant Depot? ts obvious these people don't give a crap about customers and dont have a clue about service. When they do close their doors; they will have no one to blame but themselves! [REVIEW_10] My only hesitation to write this review is that it's almost trendy to review Tria; but the biz shouldn't be punished for it...   My mistake is I passed by this place so many times thinking I should stop in; especially since it's packed; but figured the alcohol would be overpriced and food would be an expensive art project; at best. I was wrong.   Rarely do you stop at a place like this. I've been twice and both visits were everything I'd want for a nice; casual dining experience. The first time I went we were the only ones outside (it looked like it was going to rain... and it did). The servers offered to reseat us immediately but we actually opted to sit outside and watch the rain. Everything was covered so it wasn't like our server got drenched coming to our table. I had a salmon sandwich; she had a salad and we shared a cheese plate. Everything was portioned and presented very well. The wine and beer they recommend went with the lunch nicely - we had a great time; so we came back a month later. This visit was equally enjoyable. We sat at the sleek bar for a drink before being shown to our table. I feel this spot is the perfect W. Washington Square casual experience coupled with it's nearby neighbor Varga for the rowdier experience. [REVIEW_11] Decent food but have some weird priorities and service quality is quite poor. Didn't take our orders until after we sat waiting for twenty min. Food took fourth min and a gentleman sat down after us and finished his food before we even got an apology that our food would be a while. Asked for water and was ignored or forgotten twice. Decent quality food but not worth the wait or poor service. In and out would have been better.. I take it back food was rushed and salt bombs made half the dish inedible and the other half bland [REVIEW_12] Bomb.com! I forget what I ordered but it was similar to a Cuban sandwich on donut bread. My friend ordered a cinnamon sugar donut while she waited for her actual food and that was delicious. I ate everything because it was amazing and deserves all the hype it has received. I need to go back and try those stuffed donuts. [REVIEW_13] This review is solely for the hostess Meg who displayed awful customer service.    My friends and I planned to come to Sabrina's for brunch.  I currently live in the Pittsburgh area.  So when I am home; I love coming to Collingswood for some delicious eats.  I had a positive experience the last time I was at Sabrina and was hoping to create more since I was asking my friends to be in my bridal party.  There are no reservations for brunch on Sabrina's on the weekend but they will accept at least a 30-45 min call aheads for a party.  My friend did a call ahead for ten am. My friends tend to struggle with being on time and there is a policy that everyone has to be there to be seated.  The policy makes sense and I was open to the hostess that we were at fault for not all being there.   My friends didn't all show up until 10:40.  There was no table available which was fine since we were late.  But I was not okay with the hostess rudeness towards us.  She told us that we never did the call ahead despite the verified text from the restaurant saying we called ahead on my friend's phone.  We let that comment go since we were taking ownership that we were not all there on time.  She told us that the wait would be about 30-45 minutes and they will text us when the table is open.  She told us to go walk around since there was a farmers market happening close by the restaurant.  She also reminded us that the whole party had to be here.  I don't mind the reminder but again her tone was rude towards us.  We let it go again because we were at fault for our struggle with timeliness.   We take a walk and about ten minutes later we get a text that the table is ready.  We get back quickly and wait in line since there was people checking in/getting seated in front of us.  When it is our turn; the hostess tells us we missed our five minute mark and the wait was going to be a 15-30 minute wait.  Again her tone was rude and this time we were not at fault.  Her time said we arrived there six minutes after the text.  Okay this means... we were on time but we waited patiently in line for people in front of us to check in/be seated.  Which means the hostess did not wait and sat people at our table.   I initially was going to let it go but her rudeness was leaving not a good feeling.  My friend argues with her because it was not fair we were being blamed for something that was her fault this time.  Also she told us to go for a walk since the wait was going to be 30-45 minutes?!  The arguing was not worth it and I told my friends we were leaving.  We went to the tortilla press across the street.  It was a great decision; since the food was super delicious and the customer service was much more friendlier towards us. [REVIEW_14] Hubby and I were eager to try this establishment due to a rave review from some close friends. We decided for our date night we would give it a try on Saturday. We pulled up about 8pm and the open sign was turned off. We thought maybe the light was burnt out or someone just forgot to plug it in. So we proceeded to the door. There were people inside and the sign said open till 11pm; so we walked inside. It was like walking into the Twlight Zone; everyone stopped and stared at us. The woman behind the bar came over and told us they were closed. HUH! Ok.... so we left. It was very akward and unpleasant. If they were closed then the door should of been locked or a sign on the door stating private party or something.  Not sure if we will attempt to try to dine there again. [REVIEW_15] I love it here! So many talented employees. Staff is always friendly. Always a great feeling going here and even better when I leave. I get cut and colored here; hair and makeup done for weddings; and I also enjoy their spa services for a great classic facial. [REVIEW_16] The TV shows are $4.99 and they have commercials! What a cheesy way to make money and a sign of a less than classy hotel; particularly when you pay more than $150 a night.  And there is NO complimentary breakfast; just an overpriced buffet; something even the cheapest hotels in California provide. [REVIEW_17] At 6:03pm; the PSTA Driver sped through the Marina; not even bothering to slow down to pickup the Passengers; which there were 9 Passengers waiting. That Driver (a White Guy; just to narrow it down) should be Fired Immediately! [REVIEW_18] Rudest bartenders I've encountered. Made us wait forever for drinks while they texted. Female bartender lost my husband's card when I tried to close out our tab and told me to calm down when I explained the green card she was holding wasn't ours. she insisted she did not have my husband's card at all and continued to speak to me like I was a moron. Never going back again! [REVIEW_19] Chill has incredible creative food combinations that are absolutely delicious! My family and I love this restaurant. The staff and owner are delightful as well. [REVIEW_20] I know I shouldn't expect much but everything I asked for that was on the drive thru menu was not available. I was actually afraid of what I was going to get once I did get it. I saw the movie ""waiting"".  Word of advice stay clear of this arch. Just so you know I was only trying to order a beverage how pathetic is that. [REVIEW_21] This was my second visit here; and it was much worse than the first. This restaurant is extremely small; and if there aren't any seats; you are welcome to stand in the back by the bar without seating; in the way of all the commotion. We stood by the bar for about ten minutes before we were asked if we needed something. We wanted to eat; but not standing up. We saw multiple tables open up; and had to ask if we could sit there; even though we were the only people waiting. We finally sat; and a young;brunette waitress came and took our order. We wanted two orders of the Short Rib fries appetizer; since we would be having it as our dinner opposed to sharing it; and she looked at us like we asked her to bring the whole cow to our table. She asked us if we were sure that we wanted two; and we confirmed that we did. The first order came out in about 5 minutes which was amazing. 10 minutes went by; then 15; and our server didn't even come over to see how our first dish was; just stood in the corner chatting. We got another servers attention after 20 minutes of waiting and let him know we were still waiting on our order. We also advised him that if it wasn't ready; to forget about it and we would share the first one. He came back and told us that it would be out any second. Another ten minutes went by; still no dish; still nothing from our original server. We let the young man know that we were no longer interested in the dish that was 25 minutes late; and then our original server finally decided to come over! Could you believe the first thing she said was ""so im hearing that you never got the second batch of fries?"". As if it was some kind of rumor. Then had the nerve to ask if we still wanted it. She took it off the bill but I was extremely disappointed with the service; and will certainly not return the next time I am in town. Especially since I got sick in the middle of the night from it. Village Whiskey; please train your staff how to serve properly; and give them some lessons on customer service. [REVIEW_22] Probably the worst service ever... Was here on a Sunday evening with a group of 4 to get drinks and a couple apps.  My friend was served the wrong beer twice.  My drink took so long that the ice was melted by the time I got it.  I asked for a straw for my water and my server said ""there's no water in there."" No lie. Manager tried to fix the situation and she was polite and slightly more helpful.  The food we did receive was tasty; if cold. At least it was an entertaining night! [REVIEW_23] I simply love this place; best breakfast in New Orleans by far ...... Ok so I must say more for this to be a review!! I had banana foster French toast to die for; the shrimp and grits are perfect. Not over season with Really creamy grits & a Fresh carrot& apple juice cold and refreshing omelet with ham cheese and avocado AMAZING!!!! Diet starts soon [REVIEW_24] OUTSTANDING Mexican food! Great flavors that I haven't experienced at other Mexican restaurants. [REVIEW_25] Second time I've gone in there to order burger; fries & shake and not only was the order taker rude but they didn't have Key Lime flavoring for their shake; without explanation.   So I took my business elsewhere. [REVIEW_26] Terrible; just terrible!  They need to tear this place down immediately.  I remember going here in the 80's for decent pizza & to a movie; but time has passed this place buy.  I went into Kmart to look for backpacks just a week ago and even that was a bad experience.  All there stuff looked old and outdated.   Why don't they turn this place into a Target; its practically empty anyway.  Either the stores have gone out of business for lack of shoppers or wisely moved elsewhere.  Sorry to see this location die a slow death; but its no more than an eye sore now. [REVIEW_27] I went to this store because they carried the phone that my daughter wanted.  I had researched the price and knew what i needed. The sales Associate; seemed professional; until he told me the price of my bill!  the numbers did not add up. I was shocked to say the least.  He was trying to sell me a shield for my phone; for 40.00- I did not ask for this.  I only wanted the phone and a case. I told him about my employer discount at least 5 times.  He gave me a ""new"" price; which seemed to be more in the ballpark of what I was looking to spend.  I asked for my receipt; and was not provided a detailed break down of what my charges were- first time ever! I was so angry that I had to leave the store. I called Verizon when I got home; they were able to direct me to my detailed receipt on line.  Turns out he charged me for insurance that I was not offered nor did I want and he did not give me my accessory discount! I am still so angry over how this sales associate tried to screw me and my daughter.  Buyer beware!!! ask for a detailed receipt.  do some homework before you go if you choose to use this store.  needless to say I will never go back there! [REVIEW_28] Jessica C. was Super Helpful; it's a Huge & Busy Store;  i can't even tell how much she helped this newbie on the South East corner across from the Speedwasy Shopping Mall; across the street from Marsh & also directly across from KFC [REVIEW_29] The food was decadent! We started with appetizers; calamari; ravioli; and the shrimp cocktail. Now the shrimp cocktail is very spicy with a whole bunch of kick! It definitely cleaned out any sinuses for me. I then ordered the scallops on top of a bed of couscous with a red skin mashed potatoes. The potatoes were the best! And my scallops were delicious! Also try the Thai Basil gin drink; it was the best on the menu that looked delicious! [REVIEW_30] I made an appointment ahead of time for a gel manicure and basic pedicure. I assumed that a Sunday afternoon would be fairly crowded so when I arrived half an hour early I was surprised they were slow enough to take me ahead of my appointment.   Why they were slow; I do not understand because they did an absolutely phenomenal job! The technicians were friendly; the salon was clean and affordable. This place is the best I've been to in St. Louis and I can't believe if wasn't packed to capacity.   Highly recommend!!",12
72,"[REVIEW_1] Been here twice now.  Both times I ordered a caesar salad with chicken; and both times it was a bust.  Some of the produce was wilted; browning and bitter; and just doused in dressing beyond anything reasonable.  Counter service was so-so.  First time I went in; there were two staff members taking their time.  I was third in line; and it took almost 20 minutes to walk out with my to-go order.  Second time I was in; there was literally no one behind the counter or anywhere in sight for almost 10 minutes.    No bueno; Fresh Bar.  Thanks anyway. [REVIEW_2] We tried Zorba's for the first time last weekend; and it was absolutely perfect. It's a charming little spot with AMAZING food. Having tried several greek places in the area; this is my most definitely my favorite. Loved the fact that it's BYOB! We began with the spicy feta dip (the cold one; not the hot one!) and it was very flavorful. An awesome portion for the price.  I had the Artichokes Constantinople as my entrée; and it was FAB. The sauce was tangy; salty; and so satisfying. I can't wait to go back and get them again. My fiancé had some type of meat dish; I really can't remember what- but he loved it. Everything was tender and cooked to perfection. Also; the service was great; friendly; and fast. I can't wait to go back ASAP! [REVIEW_3] Great experience -- second time at Granite City Brewery. Our server Kylie was top notch - great food and drink recommendations; service. We had the the pulled pork waffle sandwich and pepper maple bacon flatbread. Worth another visit real soon! [REVIEW_4] Love; love; love that I found a trustful; great dentist in the area! Staff is GREAT and Dr. S is the best. [REVIEW_5] When I first walked in; it seemed an ok place but by the time I realized it was a mistake to get mani and pedi done here; it was too late. I got shellac done and they applied 10-12 coats of paint and gel.  It started peeling off in 3-4 days.  My nails look all rough after the nail paint has peeled off. Also; the people working there were talking to each other in Mandarin.  I felt really awkward there. They used some neon green colored massage lotion or something.  Ewww.  I am never going back! [REVIEW_6] I love Roma burgers; I try to have one in every city I visit but this location butchered the Roma burger. Over cooked the usually mouth melting burger so it was tough. Over toasted the bun so it was tough. A shame. Next time I will try a different location. [REVIEW_7] Best BBQ joint I've found in Nashville. The pulled pork BBQ is amazing. The bartender is awesome and the banana pudding; OMG. Let's talk about the banana pudding. It's ridiculous. I always leave needing a nap I get so full. Check it out. [REVIEW_8] I love this place. The owner is awesome and very hands on. Everyone that works here is friendly and will talk to you. I eat here a couple times a week.   I like that they know me by name. [REVIEW_9] This place has the worst customer service! We were the 2nd in line to sell clothing; and by the time they get to ours they don't even look the just start throwing things to the side without even looking at them... They are rude!!! Take your time to drive elsewhere!!! It's worth it to use the gas and pass this place [REVIEW_10] Breakfast was vile; everything tasted like grease! [REVIEW_11] Yesterday was my first visit to Paris Parker. I have never gone to a stylist that didn't come with a recommendation in my life until now. I was short on time and wanted to go somewhere near my home.  They told me I would see Stacey for my full highlight appointment.   She was awesome!  She got all the brassy color out of my hair and made my blonde look natural and vibrant.   Blonde hair isn't easy and I was expecting to have to go back a couple of times to someone new until they got it just right. I was wrong.  Stacey nailed the color and was really nice to chat with too! Also a must when hanging in a chair for hours.   Highly recommend... Although I may regret it if she gets too booked up :) [REVIEW_12] Ignorant bartender. Took forever for him to wait on you at a table on a Sunday afternoon; not even during football season.  Lesson learned. Never have a bartender wait on you for food.  Number 1; they don't want to do it; but also; they don't know the menu or anything about the kitchen when you ask a question. This is a typical suburban blue collar and millennial underwhelming establishment to watch Sports in with a pint of flat Budweiser. It is perfect for blue collars who swear that walk in dressed like they just finished a 10 hr day either painting; fixing drains; or laying down planks; or up on a roof. After 10 or 11pm the DB millennials roll in; espec on weekends. [REVIEW_13] This is the best pizza in Indianapolis. It's the only pizza that tastes like pizza should that we've ever ordered anywhere in the city. The key is the crust. The second key is their sauce. It's real pizza; with real pizza taste. Most people in Indy don't know what pizza is. Once they go here that will change ! I highly recommend the white pizza with your choice of toppings. I prefer black olives and pepperoni but order the white for a little something different and you won't go wrong !! [REVIEW_14] I've had about all of their sandwiches and visit this place when I'm in the area during lunch.  I think their bread is great and their prices are phenomenal.  I also enjoy their spring rolls. [REVIEW_15] Excellent price for sushi and I love their specialties sushi menu. Snow mountain and Volcano sushi are remarkable sushi! [REVIEW_16] Gene from Chim Chimney is the man! Great customer service; excellent dustless process and an unmatched care for the customer. Gene noticed some separation in the sealer and mortar on the second story of my house while he was climbing up to inspect the chimney topper; in a place I could never have seen; but he took a picture and brought it to me so to assure that I did not experience a leak. Wow! Above and beyond the call.   Oh yes...Chim Chimney is the cheapest price in town too. [REVIEW_17] My partner and I were out of towners for a wedding; which took place at Spasso's. It was such a good spot for a wedding dinner. The space was open; staff accommodating to our needs; we enjoyed the food and our glasses never ran empty. You could've rolled us out of there after our 5-course meal! [REVIEW_18] Food 5/5 Service 5/5 Atmosphere 5/5  Came for lunch buffet.   Tandoori chicken : flavorful; juicy (not dry from the headlamps); chicken Tikka : delicious; chili chicken  and curry chicken : both very good.  Kheer (Indian rice pudding) : tastes yummy  Naan : fresh; soft; and stayed soft throughout meal.   Service : one lady doing so much.  I didn't have to ask for water refill; she was already there. Didn't have to ask for plate to be removed; she already did it. Hard working.   Atmosphere : relaxed; has music and TV that shows how they cook. And cartoons for kids too. [REVIEW_19] What a little neighbourhood gem! Amazing espresso drinks; friendly staff; and if you follow their tweets you can salivate over your iPhone as you read about their daily breakfast/lunch menu. Yeah it's a little as small but I've only done takeaway. Planning to eat in really isn't an option in the winter without the patio space. [REVIEW_20] This is my favorite coffee shop! Love the atmosphere and the coffee and food are excellent! If you go for breakfast - you have to try the bacon biscuit sandwich! Whenever we come to Tampa to visit; this is at the top of our list on where we have to stop! [REVIEW_21] WORST location  out there. I eat Chipotle 4+ times a week; and every time I go to this location I have a terrible experience.  Today; my burrito (with almost no meat put in) tortilla fell apart while trying to wrap it. He then tried to rewrap it and failed.  It came apart again on the third try... as well as the fourth.  When the fifth tortilla broke in three different spots; he still wrapped and gave it to me.  Also; have the ingredients were stuck to the previous tortilla tries.  Like I said; I eat Chipotle 4-5 times a week; but I'll be going to Qdoba after this. [REVIEW_22] I just had the worst experience with We Love Pets! It was not so much a specific problem with a product or a pet; but how poorly they handled a situation. I was scheduled to have dog my dog groomed as that is a new service they are providing.  My hsuband scheduled the first appointment for me to bring the dog on my day off; and I have to admit; a week later I completely forgot about it and did not bring her in.  We rescheduled for the following week; the day of the big snow storm and hence i cancelled the appointment. Last week was the third try; however the groomer was sick! So we tried again for today; making it late in day so that I would be able to take the dog in the afternoon as soon as I got home from work. Last night they left a message requesting we bring the dog in the morning. Today I spoke with them in the middle of the morning ; letting them know I was home sick; was trying to coordinate things; and would try to bring her in a little earlier; between 12 and 1. AT 1230 my phone rings could I bring her in immediately. Unfortunately; I am quite sick and was trying to coordinate doctors visit etc so it was going to be 1 pm when I would bring in my dog. I explained that I was unsure why they were calling as I had already agreed to move the time up one hour.  I was then told to hold on; and then told; not to bother and not to reschedule as this was the third time I had missed an appointment! NOT TRUE!!! I fully admit to missing the first appointment; and I had not yet missed todays appointment!  Before cancelling my appointment; they told me that their groomer was sitting there with nothing to do; so they wanted me to bring the dog in earlier. Is that my problem; that the groomer's schedule is not yet fully booked? They then told me they weren't supposed to schedule it that late. There again; it was their error in not educating their staff in the rules for scheduling grooming and this error was repeated multiple times when they continued to reschedule late in the day.  When I tried to explain my perspective; they hung up on me. So; my rating are for POOR PROFESSIONALISM and POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! [REVIEW_23] We wanted to pick up some Zima and a male employee was very nice and said they were sold out and Zima is sold out everywhere in town. So he helped us pick out something he said will be similar but turns out grocery stores and Walmart have Zima. Lies. Oh; and P.S. Mr. Man; Truly Lime and Midori tastes nothing like Zima and Midori so thanks for that too. [REVIEW_24] We ate in. Awful pizza.  Shared the Philly steak pizza with bacon on the side.  Pizza was oily and soggy with little sauce and no flavor. Got sauce on the side and it was so watery as to be a liability.  Bacon was just heated bacon bits (worst I ever had) with no taste but lots more grease.  We were the ONLY customers eating in the entire time. Only sound was the overloud music.  Waiter was just one of the kitchen workers who was; however; very accommodating when he was available.  If you decide to go; I wish you much better luck.  Rating on pizza = minus 2.5 [REVIEW_25] We liked this theatre the last time we visited but noticed the cleanliness wasn't up to snuff; this was in November 2016. I took the family back for an early matinee and I found the bathrooms  disgusting! I took photos due to another 2 people entering and turning around and leaving the bathroom due to the filth. I talked to R****ll and showed him the photos. His response to me was ""They are like that a lot because people trash them."" The management needs to go through some serious training classes. This AMC is losing their good clientele due to not keeping cleanliness standards higher. I don't want to know about the food items. We wont be back. [REVIEW_26] Rosemary's Grill is my favorite resaurant.  My wife and I take my Mother in law to Rosemary's Grill often for many reasons.  Their menu is extensive.  You can get Classic American food in many categories prepared fresh and delicious with great care and attention to detail that is lacking in common chain restaurants.  You can also get traditional Turkish cuisine that is the very best kebab that I ever had.  Rosemary's is a family owned business and they treat you like you are part of that family.  We are making Rosemary's our Saturday night place.  last weekend my wife and I took my. Mother in law to Rosemary's Grill for dinner.  It was even better that the time before.  I tried the Mixed grill kebab platter.  Lamb; Chicken; Adana; and gyro kebab meats; so tender and expertly spiced and grilled; along with a shepherds salad; grilled half tomatoes; rice; and of course flat bread.  The Adana kebab was particularly tender; juicy; and tasty.  I had never had Adana kebab before and will be ordering it again.  I shared a taste with my Mother in law and she loved it too!  mom in law had crab cakes and she enjoyed them very much.  My wife had the French onion soup; which she raves about and always orders.  She also had the roast turkey; mashed potatoes; cranberry sauce; and corn.  She loved everything on that platter.  She commented that the gravy was especially good.  The portion sizes are huge and we love to have the left overs again at home.  I have honestly not been to a restaurant in the area that has such good quality in all there entrees; sides; salad bar; and drinks; and you have to try the rice pudding.  We have eaten a few times here for breakfast; lunch; and dinner and it continues to be our very favorite place.  The waitstaff and owners make you feel right at home and are warm; welcoming; and friendly.  I can not say enough good things.    Sent from my iPad [REVIEW_27] The best cheese steak in Philly. Maybe the best cheese steak period. Anytime I even pass remotely by during a drive from Albany NY; I stop or make the detour to joes. Everything else there is also high quality. Clean inside and the service has always been good. If you want the best cheese steak; this is the only place you should go. [REVIEW_28] Used to be called the Hamburger Habit and they have chili fries at the Goleta location since it's the original location. I love; love; love to take the family and get a burger with grilled onions; onion rings; and a chocolate malt. This restaurant brings back childhood memories since I grew up in The Goodland. I'm glad this is now a chain so I can eat at this restaurant when I travel California! [REVIEW_29] This is totallly one of the best hotels in the city.  The rooms are heavily appointed; and the halls are too.  You can't go wrong here. [REVIEW_30] 5 stars for the consistently good music & experience that is Layla's. Wife & I were having a beverage at the bar and struck up a conversation with the patron next to us - turned out to be Layla herself!Lovely lady who generously chatted with us. & bought us a round. Never know who 'a sitting next to ya!",19
73,"[REVIEW_1] Amazingly good lunch buffet! We went on a Sunday and the variety was very impressive. Food tasted very fresh and the chef added a nice amount of heat to kick up the spice level. The good did not taste to oily or creamy (as you may find in other Indian places). The lamb biryani and fried fish masala were both exceptional. Included in the price of the buffet is a Dosa (can even get Mysore masala dosa).   This is some of the best Indian food that I've eaten in the Midwest (and that includes places in Chicago)!  Keep up the high quality and we will certainly return! [REVIEW_2] Caution- Absolutely - stay away.  There was nothing about the food that can redeem how unusually bad the food was here.  While the staff is very accommodating; you're better off skipping this restaurant.  I worked in a very large well known Cajun/creole restaurant and what we were served was very bland and poorly prepared.  Red beans were definitely from a can. I didn't taste any of the distinct flavors of red beans n rice.  There was no ham hock flavor; no bay leaf flavor or discernible mirepoix flavor.  The collard greens tasted like they had been boiled without any additional seasoning and served; poorly drained. I couldn't eat it.  The jambalaya was also very odd; most definitely from some prepackaged mix.  The jambalaya barely had any meat in it and was definitely not close to anything like jambalaya. They aught to be ashamed of calling that Jambalaya. It was more like frozen mixed vegetable rice pilaf; seriously. Jambalaya ""jambon a la aya"" the jambon (ham) is the core of the dish; seriously. Wtf.  If the management is reading this: revise your recipes and quality check often. It's a downward spiral when you sacrifice quality.  One of us who are the crawfish etouffe had terrible food poisoning.  I think there are issues with storage; food rotation; labeling and training.  Several hours after writing the review;  I was sick. [REVIEW_3] Very unfriendly to people with dietary restrictions/allergies. Refused to make an accommodation.  Wouldn't come here again. [REVIEW_4] I would not advise staying at this hotel. I called to speak to a manager after my friend put the post below and the manager was once again; very rude. [REVIEW_5] Two Tommy Bahama shirts and Saks suit pants dropped off; one shirt looked worse than before I dropped it off; the pants torn and burnt!  Avoid this place the owners took zero responsibility.  Rude beyond what I thought was possible! [REVIEW_6] Best coffee in town  in  broadripple across from Monkeys Tale Friendly servers [REVIEW_7] Delicious food; relaxed atmosphere; cocktails refreshing and Katie our waitress very friendly and knowledgeable on the menu and helped us make the right choice .5 stars [REVIEW_8] Great surprise below we drove home to San Diego. We bought another pizza to eat the next day at home. Great fresh toppings! Our favorite pizza place as of right now. [REVIEW_9] We stopped in for the crab and it did not disappoint.   The service was friendly and prompt.  We would definitely recommend this place as the crab and oyster shooters were great. [REVIEW_10] Crawfish mac n cheese = outstanding! Cornbread was awesome; too. Good strong drinks and great service. [REVIEW_11] My wife and I just moved to town and where saddened to have to move away from our local beloved Mexican restaurant.  We passed by this place several times knowing that once we moved in we would have to try it.  And OMG we where floored; the restaurant had great traditional ambiance and the service was top knotch.  They served glass bottle sodas which personally is something I love.  The food was amazing; my wife had the Taco Sombrero and I had the Chimichanga.  Both where amazing.  This place is 6 stars if I could give it. [REVIEW_12] Finally got to try the infamous prep & pastry; went in with mixed feelings thinking it was all hype no show but damn was I wrong. Ordered the steak and eggs sand which and an order of biscuits and gravy. 5 stars for my sandwich it was simply amazing!! The tri tip was flavorful but what really stole the show was the cheddar jalapeño focaccia! The sand which alone is what will bring me back to try the rest of the menu; the biscuits where delicious and the gravy was good.   Only thing that i wasn't impressed by was the Danish; I ordered the berries and cream cheese Danish and it seemed very plain and didn't stand out what so ever. There was another Danish that had a cream cheese and goat cheese mix in it so I will try that next time in hopes to redeem the pastry end of this establishment! [REVIEW_13] I will never rent from hertz anywhere again. I reserved ahead of time through AAA. I did this because I wanted to budget.the sales lady lied to me & said I had to choose 1 of the 3 insurance packages. I told her I budgeted for yay what I was told. She pushed me & said I had no choice. My Bill went up by $97 plus tax. She was cold; pushy & rude.  I was almost crying & she didn't blink. I have never driven the new Ford Focus & she didn't go over anything. I was just a dollar sign to her [REVIEW_14] Okay maybe the word awesome is overused but that is how I would describe Tobey's Junk Hauling service. He communicates well; shows up on time; and takes care of business for a reasonable price. Awesome. [REVIEW_15] Almost went to this location; but did a pivot turn when we had to step over three different types of trash just to get to the front door. Also trash scattered around the parking lot. Can't imagine how clean the kitchen is? [REVIEW_16] I have heard tons of good feedback from people about this restaurant and have planned to go eat there because of it. But i feel a bit disappointed in their customer service; i had been calling for a week for their catering services and no one ever called or texted me like they said; they didn't have prices to offer and only one person apparently does their catering quotes. If you offer catering and want to gain profit you should have something set. I ended up having to get a diff person to do it but was looking forward to their tacos. A bit bummed; maybe in the future i might eat there but I'm dissatisfied in my service as a potential client. [REVIEW_17] The steak is okay. I give it a 1 because it's not worth the price. Very expensive. You can find a much better steak at other restaurants in town. Plus; my experience was dampened by some annoying couple trying to sell me real estate as I ate at the bar. [REVIEW_18] We visited our local favorite Burger Up (in the 12 South area) on Saturday 01.30.16 around 1 pm Central.  We sat at the bar.  Eats & Drinks - 4 out of 5 stars To start; we ordered a glass of the Pinot Grigio.  In our opinion the wine could have been a bit fresher (the bottle was probably open for a while).  For food; we ordered 2 bison burgers: 1. Bison burger (no jalapenos); medium rare; on the regular setting with truffle fries on the side (the truffle fries are an up charge).   2. Bison burger; medium rare; on a mushroom setting with a kale salad on the side (the kale salad is an up charge).  We did ask for the kale salad to be sent out before the burger and although this didn't happen; the staff did apologize for the mistake.  We tend to believe Burger Up's bison burger is one of the best burgers in town and appreciate the consistency with which it's served each time.  The truffle fries are definitely worth the up charge.  They usually come out fresh and as a perfect mix between crispy and soft!  Don't forget to ask for the homemade ketchup and aioli.  They are very sweet so a little goes a long way. A healthy alternative choice for a side is the kale salad which is well balanced with a citrus vinaigrette; dried cherries; and hazlenuts.  Service - 5 out of 5 stars The staff is casual but always super friendly. Expect your server to check in with you about your experience and the meal.  Food is usually delivered in a short amount of time. The staff always seem to interact like one big family and this translates to the customer experience.   Value - 5 out of 5 stars For the amount and quality of food you receive; the restaurant offers great value.  Wherever possible; the ingredients (including the meat) are locally sourced.  You feel good knowing that your dollars count towards supporting the community; sustainability; and humane treatment of animals.  Atmosphere - 4 out of 5 stars The restaurant lends much of it's main dining room to shared bench seating.  While at times (due to the popularity of the restaurant) it can seem tight quarters; most patrons are okay with sharing a seat with each other to partake in a community-like meal. There are a few private tables in the main dining room; a bar; and a closed in patio with private tables as well. The furniture and decoration is simple; rustic; but much of it is also locally sourced.  Miscellaneous Parking is sometimes a concern as only street parking is available; however; in all our times (on average 2 times a month) visiting we've never been without a spot within 3 minutes walking distance. This restaurant has certainly outgrown this space so the indoor waiting area is essentially non-existent; however no one ever seems to mind! [REVIEW_19] Don't go on Sundays. I want to like this place but they won't let me. Tonight was the third time after two ""eh"" trips. The food is good. The presentation is very bad. The taste of the house margaritas is a selling point; however; you get 4 oz of ice and probably 3 oz of actual margarita if you're lucky. The service is not good. There is no accountability from management or servers. I was told ""It's not my fault; guys."" tonight (8/24/14) that I had to wait over an hour for food. I never received my refried beans and rice so that made it sting a little more to be overpaying for a mediocre experience.      I wanted this place to open and be awesome but it seems like all they did was open. More classic dishes need to be added; prices need to be evaluated and customer service and staffing needs some serious attention. I may give it a shot after some time has passed when the kinks may be worked out. I have no intention of going back until I hear something different.  Even then it's going to be hard to drag me in there. Again; this is a bummer because I want to like this place and give them my money AND feel good about it. [REVIEW_20] Walked in about 3pm. Five employees huddled around the bar.  Several looked at us no one spoke. Finally we walked out.  Called the manager and told him what happened. He says; ""well the bartender motioned to you all"".  Really?  No one spoke and it was like we intruded. Rude and unprofessional.  By the way; the ""manager"" could have cared less. [REVIEW_21] Loved; Loved; Loved Annlyn!  My wife and I recently were looking for a place and Annlyn was GREAT. She made us feel at home before we ever saw an apartment. The building is loaded with amenities ( a massage room; fitness room; rooftop; way more than I can even describe- truly fabulous)  I highly recommend Fusion1560 and I  recommend you deal with Annlyn. [REVIEW_22] Specifically came to the mall to get my brows done before a trip out of town and I walked in and stood there for two minutes until someone poked their head out of the back with two children and said they were on lunch break...was told to come back in 45 minutes. It was extremely unprofessional. No sign to indicate they were closed or anything! I will not be coming back. [REVIEW_23] Ya; unfortunately our favorite local theater has officially crashed and burned! Last time we go.... just isn't worth $47 for three adult tickets; then my wife and I have to run the theater too.  I will start with arrival; an irritated bartender; upset customers asking for help; getting eye rolls from employee; then once the movie started; had to tell same irritated bartender to have someone turn off the bright lights in the movie theater; the movie has been running for 5 minutes already; had to change out soda twice; both were flat; with very little syrup.  screen was dark; no surround sound on. All in all; was a great place at one time; now; just drive by; you will be glad you did.  It was obvious no management or any sense of concern for the customer. What a joke! [REVIEW_24] After living in the STL area for way over 10 years now; I am both ashamed and remorseful to admit that I ate here for the FIRST time just a few weeks ago. I am ashamed because it's a St. Louis tradition and remorseful because I missed out on it for so..many...years!   This place is amazing. What is not to love! It's a factory where you can get a tour (Friday-Sunday; noon-5pm on the hour); there's a shop; bar; and dining area. They also host many event with live music on the weekends. It's fun to just kind of wander and look around - don't worry; you'll get a chance because there will likely be a wait before you dine. The beer is; of course; amazing. The Hefeweizen is my personal favorite and a great start for anyone who is not a huge beer drinker (like myself). Additionally; the food is homegrown and damn good. I had the pizza (recommendation from my server) and it was really spectacular; though I'm admittedly a pizza connoisseur so I enjoy a good pizza pie more than most probably ;P My date had a bison burger which was also really good.   More fun info: the service is great! I think they tend to hire more funky and alternative people (like tattoo parlor staff) which I support. The quality is what makes this place stand out along with the emphasis on local food and brewery.   It is a little on the pricier side but for all the experience you get and the quality; it is worth it. I will go again and again and you probably should; too! [REVIEW_25] Apartment is falling apart there is no insulation they don't repair anything. You can never get in touch with anyone the amenities are non existent there is no gate the pool is closed. The forced trash service sucks. Insects get in all the broken windows. They do anything to get you to move in and NOTHING to fix anything. You can hear your neighbors pee and everything else! Everyone has the same complaints it's crazy. We are trying to buy a house as soon as we find one we are out of here it's ridiculous. See pictures! Don't move here it's not worth it. [REVIEW_26] I went here with a group of friends during Restaurant Week and it was the complete opposite from what we were expecting. We heard that it was the best crab in Philadelphia; so why wouldn't we want to try it? As one of the guys put it; we felt like we were at ""Bingo Night"" as soon as we walked in. No big deal tho; we had an 8pm reservation and the nine of us arrived about ten minutes early; knowing we would most likely have to wait a little. Nothing prepared us for the 45 minutes of waiting that we ended up standing through. The boys were fine; they went to the bar and made friends with what seemed to be like a regular crowd. When we were finally seated and all decided on our dishes (thank goodness); our server began The Countdown. I have never experienced this before but with every course or round of drinks he would come over and tell us ""Okay guys; about 7 more minutes"" then return a few minutes later and say ""Alright well we have about 3 more minutes left"" and as annoying as it was; he made us all laugh. So it was fine. I ordered the RW special that was salmon stuffed with a crab cake; and it was okay. I would have been fine if the food were on par with a 45 minute wait but it just was not worth it. The best part of the entire experience was the store bought chocolate cake we had for dessert; as they vacuumed around us. [REVIEW_27] I had a similar experience like one of the previous reviewers. I was given a quote for HR-V online for 19;507. I went there; test drive it talked about the quote I was give online from that dealer and they printed out the offer. The salesman leave  and when he came back 20-30mins later; he  said that it most had been a mistake cause the average if 21;500( for the price of the vehicle). I guess they don't understand very well what does average mean; which is some people bought at a higher price and some at a lower price. The salesman was very polite and respectful but he said that he couldn't give the deal they gave us online and it was up to the manager ( which I previously heard getting too loud with another costumer). I decided that I prefer to pay the price they wanted us to pay now ( 22;507) to another dealer; than to pay it to a dealer that try to trick us.  Business is all about respect ( which they didn't have for us and our time) and honesty ( which they didn't have as they try to say it must had been an error from the internet). At the end of the day they tried to change the quote the gave us when the manager saw that they would be making as much as they wanted for the vehicle. Conclusion; unless you know one of the salesman or don't mind the change of price just cause; do yourself a favor and go to another dealership. [REVIEW_28] What a fun little find. Busy first thing in the morning! Our server was spunky and fun; just the right amount of perfect service.   My husband was starving and grumpy after our red eye flight in from Cali; this was the perfect meal to perk him right up!   I ordered plain crepes with powdered sugar; they were thick unlike an ordinary crepe which was a little weird but; none the less delicious. I topped them off with some cinnamon-cream syrup. My husband enjoyed a meaty man omelet with a side of cinnamon and sugar pancakes.   The portions are just right. Totally worth the extra 10 min drive from the airport. [REVIEW_29] Cheap. Large portions. The flavor is OMG! The bar just sets it off. I will be a regular here! [REVIEW_30] It pains me to rate anyone a single star; but I really was disappointed with my meal at Market Grill last night and won't be back.    We; a three-some; went on the recommendation of an acquaintance.  First impression walking in the door; smoke-free (yay!) and beautiful original brickwork; but a really scrubbed-clean feeling.  Which is good; or could be.  Maybe it just felt out of place in Soulard :).    From there it was all downhill.  The menus we were given were dog-eared; ripped; with pen marks and spots of indeterminable provenance.  Poor impression.  Print some new menus.    We were not offered a drink list.  When I asked for the drink list; the server said; ""We don't have a drink list; but I can get you a wine menu.""  But there is a neon Bud Light sign in the window.  If you don't have a list printed; use your voice and tell me what you offer.  A note on the wine menu: sorted into reds and whites.  Fair enough.  Beneath the reds?  The whites.  And beneath the whites?  The reds.  Print some new menus.  And considering the venue; their wine pricing is high.  The server made no effort to sell us drinks.    The food.  The first thing the server told us was that they were out of the soup of the day.  Ok; fine; benefit of the doubt; it must have been excellent and super-popular; right?  We started with hummus - not my choice.  Did not meet expectations.  I ordered meatloaf.  It was surprisingly dense and rather dry - full of filler.  The mashed potatoes looked more like mashed hash browns; I don't quite know how to describe them.  The green beans had to have come from a freezer bag.  And the fried onion & jalapeno straws were completely out of place on the plate.  I probably left half of my food behind; I could have done better at home.    One of my friends ordered a wrap he seemed to enjoy; the other ordered the special - they serve prime rib Saturday evenings.  She found it under-done but it looked right to me.  For some reason we thought we might need an order of the mac and cheese.  Friends; if your mother ever made you mac and cheese; this will be a disappointment.    My glass of wine was empty for; I don't know; a good half an hour.  The server never noticed.    The facilities in the handicap bathroom I realize must have been built to code but anyone paying attention will notice that the soap dispenser; mirror; and towel dispenser are unsuitably high for someone sitting in a wheelchair.    I wish Market Grill all the best; someone has put a lot of love into the building and is trying to make it as an entrepreneur; and I appreciate that.  But they need some serious focus and refinement on the menu concept and design and a reboot on the service.",14
74,"[REVIEW_1] Greatly enjoyed the shellfish here. And the service is excellent. The lobster roll is delicious. Clam chowder was definitely a hit. The lobster bisque was a little too heavy on the tomato; but still good. And the local rock crab was fantastic.   Highly recommend this place if you're enjoying some time on the pier. [REVIEW_2] Woah! This place ROCKS!   I stopped here for a late lunch with my partner while visiting Philly. We are huge burger fanatics so if you aren't into burgers then just come for the drinks as these burgers can be pricy especially with the add ons. I actually went overboard with the additions and found it to be too much. My partners simple burger with cheese ended up being perfect and tasty.   I enjoyed a Mint Julep (was just in the mood for one) but can say that if you are a whiskey drinker; there are soooo many options.   This place is a must for whiskey lovers! [REVIEW_3] If you want to eat at Prep & Pastry on the weekends; go right when it opens or before it closes. There is always a long wait because of how busy it gets - but the wait is always worth it. The food there is absolutely amazing. I go there often and love the green eggs & ham; bloody marys; and mimosas! They gave me a free pastry on my birthday once; it was delicious! I wish I remembered what it was called.   I also love that they serve EXO coffee here (a local coffee) - nothing better than a great breakfast with great coffee to go with it! [REVIEW_4] Growing up I lived right by Donut Drive-in.  We'd go every week after church and my sister and I would fight over the sprinkle donuts or the blueberry iced donuts.  Having moved back to St. Louis recently I forgot all about this place until one day my husband said ""Wow; that place looks old"" and I said ""We'll go there some weekend"" ---it took a few weeks but finally we were in the area so I got a dozen donuts for breakfast--HEAVEN!  I went in and picked out the donuts and it was like my entire youth flooding back--they haven't changed a bit which is comforting and also it makes sense--if it ain't broke; don't fix it!  My personal favorite is the french cruller with chocolate icing.  Tastes just like I remember although the custard with powdered sugar is a close second.    It was packed when I went inside but it took no time at all to get my box o' donuts.  Donut drive-in; don't ever change! [REVIEW_5] I promised Keswick I would do a Yelp last week (sorry guys) and here it is! I don't really review a lot of things at all; but this is worth it. I had gotten a groupon for a basic tune up as a a gift and took my bike in; asking them to pay special attention to my super wobbly hub. I believe it was Brian who I spoke with and warned me that they might need to replace the wheel; promising he would call and update me. I left a little wary since usually when a bike shop tells me something like that it means they're trying to get a little something extra outta ya. But the next morning I got a call from Keswick telling me all they had to do was clean it up a little and that my bike was already done! They were also more than willing to let me keep it there for a few days since my work schedule overlapped their hours. Once I picked it up I was pleased to find that it actually rode better than when it was brand new; and I didn't end up paying more than what was already covered by the groupon. Keswick does a fast; thorough job while trying to keep it as cheap as possible for the customer; and keeping terrifically upbeat and friendly attitudes. One of the best bike shops in Philly. [REVIEW_6] Went here during vacation and it was amazing! So much so that we went back the next day. We have alligator bites and calamari as appetizer. The alligator bites are amazing with lemon; yum! I had oysters both days. 12 oysters for 9.99; so delicious. We also tried a crab trapper drink; it was ok but I'll I'm a beer kind of gal so I'm a little biased. Misty was our server; ask for me! She is an absolute delight and the sweetest ever. [REVIEW_7] Wow!! AWESOME!! I have always had fast; friendly; reliable service! Take out and delivery no matter what my order is always fresh and delicious. FRESH FRESH FRESH. Always catering to families with their  friendly staff and seating available with an entertainment center so dad can watch the game. They make every effort to make eating at their restaurant the best part of your day. I cannot say more positive things about Seasons of Wayne. [REVIEW_8] I went to Landmark Americana to support a charitable event the restaurant was doing for my son's school; Woodlynde. I had avoided the restaurant because of lukewarm experiences at restaurants that had previously occupied this space. But they have a new customer now due to the friendly service and good food.  They did a good job keeping the menu short and sweet which seems to allow them to focus on what they do best. I had crab bisque and a Thai salad with chicken. Both were fresh and delicious. Our server kept our drinks full. I plan to visit again with the rest of my family. [REVIEW_9] First time but not the last.  This is truly a terrific addition to the restaurant scene in Carmel.  We were there at lunch and tried the pick 2 offering.  We started with the Mista Salad which was delicious. I had the Puttanesca; my wife the Lasagna both having freshly made pasta and and sauces that will keep you coming back.  Reservations are a must for dinner. [REVIEW_10] I ate here for the first time last Friday. I was extremely happy with the experience. There were 4 of us. Drinks: great selection of craft beer and a very interesting cocktail menu. I had a bourbon cocktail called On the Roof and it was very good. They are a little pricey at $8 but it was something different. We had appetizers. The Salmon dip was spicy and sweet and awesome. We also had the calamari and the dipping sauce was excellent. For entrees 2 had the blackened Salmon with a corn compote (delish) and we had the Salmon Fish tacos. Not the best I ever had but still very good for the middle of America. I had the burger if the day. Prepared with roasted peppers and onions on a nice soft bun. They served it with crispy shoestring French fries sprinkled with parm cheese. There were so many things on the menu I wanted to try. [REVIEW_11] One of the best hotels I've ever had the pleasure of staying in. Clean; close to the airport; tasty continental breakfast; in-room fridge; spacious rooms; comfortable beds; and the friendliest staff ever. Matthew and Ricky were awesome! I definitely know where I'll be staying if I ever return to Reno. [REVIEW_12] Great atmosphere with a large outdoor seating area. Usually great bands. And love that you can pick out your cheeses and they will make a rather large cheeseboard for you! Place can get packed especially if it starts to rain! [REVIEW_13] Its an awesome place for a vegetarian person; staff is friendly and food quality is also good! Must go [REVIEW_14] Only had one experience with this place and it will be my last. I called in the night before to ask if they sell deboned duck and the man on the phone said they could but I would have to request it the day of. I called the following morning to ask to pick up a plain deboned duck and whoever the incompetent girl who answered had trouble getting my order clear. I picked up my order and came home to find that not only did they gave a whole duck with stuffing I never asked for. I called the place back and thy never offered any compensation of any sort except a trade in right as it's a hour before dinner time and the butcher shop is more than thirty minutes away for me. Shame that food from this place is overshadowed by their terrible customer service. [REVIEW_15] We went here for dinner tonight; before we went out to Bourbon street and the atmosphere was so fun! Cafe Pontalba is a little breezy restaurant overlooking Jackson square in the French Quarter. The food is amazing; and the staff is so sweet! I had to get the cajun combination with gumbo; red beans and rice; and jambalya! My three all time favorite foods EVER... and of course they were to die for :] We also had fried gator for an appetizer; and I hate to admit it; but is was so dang good! The perfect way to start your night! [REVIEW_16] Awesome service (ask for Amanda; resident comedian); very friendly staff.  Food was really good and beer was cold. [REVIEW_17] Mozzarella has been opened for a few months now and its reputation is growing quickly by word of mouth.  I can only speak for their pizza (which is the best on this side of town); but their menu consists of salads; pasta; subs; calzones; and so on. They delivery and do carry-out; but they have a nice seating area if you'd rather dine in. Free wi-fi and $4.95 lunch specials.  Call first to see if they still have their carry-out special: a large one-topping pizza for only $7.99 or 5 toppings for $10.99! [REVIEW_18] My wife and I LOVE this place. The management is always very attentive and the service is excellent! Things to try: Tiger Roll; Pink Lady Roll; Tornado Roll. Ask for Billy he's our favorite. I highly recommend this place of others in the same area. Enjoy! [REVIEW_19] Never fails; this place is awesome. My personal faves tend to be the biscuit and the savory Dutch baby (regardless of toppings). [REVIEW_20] Great food and atmosphere. Cobb salad is awesome. Would definitely recommend this establishment. [REVIEW_21] Thank you Chef John Besh!  My husband and I stayed at the Hilton hotel on St. Charles. One of my main goals was to find some delicious New Orleans grinds.  I was starving when we arrived and didn't want to do any research on Yelp for a place to eat.  Thank God Luke was connected to our hotel!!!  We ended up eating here 3 times over 5 days.  It's usually full of business suits; but that doesn't bother me when the food is so good.  All the traditional dishes were good; but the huge surprise was the burger.  I was against ordering a burger while I was in New Orleans; because I wanted to try as many local eats as possible... and you can find burgers anywhere.  I overheard this lady raving about how delicious her burger was; so I had to order it the next time we ate there.  She was absolutely right!  It was one of the best burgers I've ever had!  It was huge; juicy; and packed with flavor.  I also highly recommend getting their bread pudding a la mode.  It was mouth-watering good and straight out the oven! [REVIEW_22] They were so sweet when we came in to get Luna's nails clipped and didn't even charge us for our first visit.  Luna can be a bit skittish around new people but she was very comfortable with the ladies.  We will definitely be going back; and recommending them. [REVIEW_23] One of our favorite Mexican places in the area. It's close by and very reasonably priced. We especially love the guacamole; fajitas; tacos; orchata; and chimichangas. Everything is authentic; fresh; and tastes delicious. Though it's not a fancy dining room; it is clean and spacious. Check it out; you won't be disappointed. [REVIEW_24] Great food; amazing service!   This is a hidden gem in the area.   I hope more people go here!! [REVIEW_25] I am oh so happy w/ Dr. Valez and Dr. Youngblood.  I had an emergency from a poor dentist in Philadelphia who made every single filling hurt.  I had four; and walked out in loads of pain after I was not numb.  I have had 16+ fillings in my life and I have never walked out in pain or had to come back for an adjustment.  I knew something was wrong.  Dr. Valez was my go-to for the second opinion and I wish he was my first dentist I went to in Philadelphia.    Malyssa; the front desk personnel is superb and responds to emails and phone calls and is couteous!!  The dental assistance was also very knowledgable and understood my needs and was empathetic.   I am oh so happy at this office; although; I'm still in pain from the original dental work... Dr. Valez is very patient and takes time to adjust my bite and mouthguard to ease the pain.  After all; shouldn't every doctor do this after a filling?  I would go to either doctor in a pinch.    The office is VERY CLEAN.   BIG TIP: do your work ahead of time.  This practice is out of network for me; but would have cost me less than an in-network doctor; for basic cavities.   Do yourself a favor and just come here...Malyssa helped me discover this in/out network really isn't a big difference.  She helped look into all of my coverage and details and called me back immediately. [REVIEW_26] The Allman Brothers (grilled veggies; black beans and manchego cheese; warmed; in a spinach wrap) and a lemon bar.  'Nuff said.  FYI; Lilly's also does a great job catering as well.  Excellent selection of sandwiches; beautifully arranged; fresh fruit trays and desserts to die for.  Just so 'ya know. [REVIEW_27] Needed to have a section of my carpet repaired in my bedroom. The Team and R&N was prompt and very focused on making the room look like new. They did just that. Great value; I would definitely give them a shot. [REVIEW_28] Went to this car wash. My car looked just as dirty coming out  as it did going in. I informed the owner and she said that the car wash will not get all the dirt off and that's why they give you a towel. I thought the purpose of a car wash was to clean my car. I could see if it was filthy dirty with caked on mud or something. There was just dust on my car. It should've been cleaned. [REVIEW_29] Wow. We had the pleasure of one of the best dinning experiences in a very long time.  I travel a lot and eat out 80% of the time so I am exposed to many types of dinning scenarios.   We sat at the upper bar and had drinks and dinner.  Let's start with the staff. Incredible!  We interacted with two bar tenders and a few other staff. All were extremely knowledgeable and passionate about their role in the org.  You can tell that the owners treat and train everyone at a high level.   Let's get to the food and drink.  We had the Brussels sprouts and Yuca fries to start.  Both outstanding. Then we ordered the Paella; cauliflower and canelones.  Everything was fresh with unique flavor.  The pickled Fresno peppers were so good the staff gave me a tub to take home.  And because we asked so many questions we were given a tour of the kitchen to meet the chief.  That's a first.  The beer and drinks were on par with the food.  I have zero negatives and will be back. [REVIEW_30] Fantastic restaurant located in the the heart of Jacksons square! The ambience was very classy. A bit pricey but; worth the experience. We opted for the pre-fixed menu; which included an appetizer; entree with about 5 different options and a desert. After dinner we took a trip upstairs where it is very eclectic. Although there is no food or beverage service on the patio; you can order a cocktail down stairs; and enjoy it on the patio over looking Jackson Square!",28
75,"[REVIEW_1] Yesterday was my first visit to Paris Parker. I have never gone to a stylist that didn't come with a recommendation in my life until now. I was short on time and wanted to go somewhere near my home.  They told me I would see Stacey for my full highlight appointment.   She was awesome!  She got all the brassy color out of my hair and made my blonde look natural and vibrant.   Blonde hair isn't easy and I was expecting to have to go back a couple of times to someone new until they got it just right. I was wrong.  Stacey nailed the color and was really nice to chat with too! Also a must when hanging in a chair for hours.   Highly recommend... Although I may regret it if she gets too booked up :) [REVIEW_2] Love this place. I tried Clayton nail salon after moving to St. Louis but this place is so much better. People here care about you and listen to what you want. Will definitely go back. [REVIEW_3] All I can say is WOW! The clam chowder is the best I've tasted in Nashville! The chicken salad is delicious and the cupcake was wonderful! I will definitely be going back!!! [REVIEW_4] Service was slow; forgot my order; took over ten minutes to get drink after ordering which I may add it took about 10 minutes to even get the server over here.....not worth the money at all [REVIEW_5] Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a delicious meal at a reasonable price. The shrimp and goat cheese crepes are a must have! [REVIEW_6] Went there for brunch today. Unfortunately; the person assigned to the omelet station had no idea how to cook AND she was sooooooo slow.  She overcooked every omelet and could not handle a two burner station. [REVIEW_7] If you are not Italian and ""from the neighborhood"" expect to get ""less than"" everything - service; time at the table you reserved because a ""regular"" wants your table; and even smaller portions than the regulars! No kidding! The food is great so I definitely recommend it for that; but everything else around the food was; well; unpleasant (and I am being polite)! It's clear the owners don't care about generating new clientele from outside the neighborhood. Oh well; their loss. The owners should take note of the zillions of other restaurants within walking distance. [REVIEW_8] SO GOOD!  My friends and I came here after a long day rock climbing on Mt Lemmon. The owner (I think?) was incredibly nice and helpful.  But most importantly the food was amazing! Especially for the price; we are all college students so its basically our number one goal to find quality; cheap food. I ordered the Beef Gyro with ""greek fries""; which I would suggest %100. They were seasoned so well; with lemon and other things I couldn't name. I was just so impressed by this small; modern; simple yet incredibly delicious Greek restaurant. Ive worked in very fancy restaurants; yet I would direct anyone to ZOE Mediterranean instead of McMahons or other overpriced menus.   As we were finishing up our meal; the owner brought out some free; fresh hummus and pita bread; saying; ""You should have told me you are starving students! Next time just let us know and we will give you a free snack"" We all agreed it was an amazing spot and proceeded to tip as well as we could.   I would highly recommend this; if you are ever hiking; camping; climbing; wandering near Catalina Highway; eat here! Or just make your way to this area; I would seriously say its worth it. [REVIEW_9] If you want to get the job done right the first time; Accurate is your contractor.  Having dealt with many contractors in the past; I am very pleased with the level of professionalism; promptness; and responsiveness.  You may pay a little more; but the quality; thoroughness; and turnaround are worth it.  I first got in touch with Mirek for an estimate on a Friday regarding a small leak in my roof.  Mirek didn't waste any time getting up there with his ladders; taking measurements; and taking pictures of the issues to show me.  He provided a consultation on what needed to be fixed including noting some issues with my gutters (more on that later).  He walked me through the different options and prices and didn't push the higher priced options over the lower except to say that the materials were obviously better.  I also told him that I was leaving for a business trip next week and that I'd really like to get this taken care of as soon as possible and Mirek said he'd try his best and that his crew could get it done next week. I had other contractors lined up; but I was impressed enough with his professionalism that I decided to go with Accurate on the spot.  Saturday comes along and I notice that there is some interior water damage in my dining room.  I take down a bit of the wall and discover that the sheathing in this part of the house was completely rotted away from water damage!  I immediately called Mirek and got his voicemail; but he called back within a few hours and scheduled to stop by Sunday morning.  I'm very appreciative of his responsiveness and helping to coordinate additional work on a tight schedule.  Sunday morning; Mirek and I discussed various ways to remedy the problem; the work that needed to be done; scheduling; and rough estimates of materials and labor.  Monday morning; the Accurate crew shows up and by the evening; most of the roof was already done.  Mirek's siding guy comes out from another job to take a look and eyeballs the work.  Well now it's Tuesday and what can I say?  In two days; my roof has been replaced and the front sheathing from my house was replaced and the siding put back as if nothing had happened.  The drainage from the problem area has been totally redesigned and I'm confident that it will be able to prevent the same issues from occurring again.  I'm thoroughly impressed with the turnaround time and the work that was done.  The Accurate team also didn't cut corners.  Damaged plywood on the roof was removed and replaced with new plywood instead of just putting down the new roofing over a base that was in sub-par condition.  Throughout the process Mirek was in touch and communicated with me and consulted me on what I would like to do with his suggestions as well.  Mirek expertly coordinated all parties to ensure that the job would get done ASAP and from my own project management experience; I can tell you that it's no easy task to get everything flowing so smoothly with different teams working together in lockstep.  Because of the excellent planning and coordination; the job was able to get done in just two days.  What I can advise is that Accurate's price will not be the lowest; but you will get what you paid for and the work will be thorough. [REVIEW_10] Love this place. Love my Mots & my Tom hehe all these guys are super funny and they know their stuff. [REVIEW_11] So happy I found a bomb local sushi place!! Always ignored this shop going to domino's but I'm so glad I popped in. Will be coming here more than I should from now on. I got this sushiya roll and I was more than pleased! The salmon tasted fresh and the miso was on point. 10/10 recommend this spot. [REVIEW_12] STAY AWAY! I am a gold member; so I stay at Hamptons frequently. I have stayed here before; and it seems to be under constant construction. My room was dirty. I came back to give them another chance as it is close to my appointments. I show up for a four night stay; and they send me away because they are booked; but tell me I can come back tomorrow night. Seriously? I couldn't believe that. I wont be back. [REVIEW_13] Awesome soup and sandwich. Perfect place for a cocktail and lighter meal. Recommend for sure!! [REVIEW_14] I am a groupie. He is amazing. I am sad that I got to have his dish only once. Now all construction on market I can't find him!!  His chicken is the most tender and smoky I've ever had. Side dishes are creative and awesome too.  I hope he is back soon. [REVIEW_15] Really truly slow service.  Not the waitress. The kitchen. 40 min to get a pasta and salad.  Recommended if you want to really drag that date out. [REVIEW_16] Cake Life is one of my favorite bakeries-and I've only been there once! I ordered the chocolate chip walnut cookie; while my sister ordered the Campfire Cocoa cake. We received the Fiesta cake by accident; and the server was kind enough to allow us to keep both slices of cake. The cookie was crispy on the outside but chewy on the inside. Could've used a little bit more sea salt but the chocolate chips were so fudgey and rich so I didn't have much to complain about. The campfire cake was delicious. The cake is moist and fluffy; while the whipped cream is chocolatey. Reminded me of the days I'd come back home from school on a winter day and I'd rip one of those Swiss Miss packets open into warm milk. The buttercream is made with Swiss Miss by the way! The Fiesta cake is a bit more dense; with a cream cheese frosting. Definitely an enjoyable experience. The shop itself is very cute and beautiful. I'll be returning... very soon! [REVIEW_17] Horrible customer service.  Customers should be allowed to try on another size.  The sales associate actually refused to get me another size; which is not what I have experienced at other stores.  I wasn't asking for anything out of the ordinary; I only took in 2 bras and wanted ONE of them in a different size.  The store wasn't busy so I don't understand her reluctance. You can give me advice on how it should fit; but don't make me stand there peeking out of the fitting room doorway; half dressed; trying to justify why I just want to *try* the next size up.  I know how I want my lingerie to fit and will go elsewhere where I won't be put in such a humiliating situation. [REVIEW_18] Just down right darn good pizza with lots of different varieties you don't see much anywhere else! And hello beers! [REVIEW_19] I've done a lot of business with Cristalvetro over the past 7 years and never had a problem until recently. I sent in an order with a deposit back in February; and never heard from them. When I started to follow up a few months ago they never returned my calls or emails. I eventually went into their storefront and was told that my top was in their Brooklyn warehouse and could get delivered the following week; I called to follow up on the delivery and was told that the top was damaged and they could not deliver it and would remake it. That made me think that they were lying about having it ready at all. I gave it a few more weeks and heard nothing after many more unanswered calls and emails. At this point I doubt I will ever get my table top or my deposit from them; I will not do business with them again. [REVIEW_20] I have been looking for a new dentist for awhile and always saw this one when visiting my bank. I finally decided to try it out with the new patient cleaning/x-ray special they have and I am very glad that I did. I was having a problem as well with one tooth and didn't know what to expect from a new dentist but I was very happy when Dr Su told me that nothing was wrong with it. I'm always nervous when seeing a new Dr in general so its reassuring when they tell you everything looks great. The staff from the time I walked in to the time I left were very friendly and caring and I really liked Dr Su. They all listened to my questions and answered them with sincerity. I would definitely recommend them and can honestly say that I am very pleased that I found my new dentist. Definitely 5 stars! [REVIEW_21] Awful noise and constant interruptions by staff to ask how things are going.  Ridiculous dancing. Etc. never again...goy a headache in about 10 minutes! [REVIEW_22] Worst hotel I've ever stayed at. Breakfast was terrible; and they had NO sugar in the entire hotel for coffee. We got stuck multiple times in the pool room because of the door not properly working. My sons feet were black from walking barefoot in our room. The water in the bath tub was constantly draining while my son was trying to take a bath. And we only came across one staff member who was polite to us. We checked out and went to a different hotel that was much better. [REVIEW_23] Both times I have gone to Mojo it has delivered! Danny our server was very attentive and gave us great recommendations; I don't think we would have gotten all we did if he didn't sell everything so well. Every night they have some type of pitcher deal for their drinks which is nice. 25% off a different cocktail pitcher every night is such a great deal! Get the Seared Ahi Tuna; Baked Goat Cheese and Blue Cheese Stuffed Bacon Wrapped Dates!! Those were definitely a favorite between my boyfriend and I. [REVIEW_24] Fantastic spot to sit down; cool down; and sip the best espresso in Indy. Lots of tables and super friendly and helpful staff. I would come back here again and again and again. I had the Italian macciado. It is very smooth and sweet. Expertly done. Thanks for the great time guys. [REVIEW_25] Absolutely horrible food. The place was dirty and smelled. I ate here once and never again. Not too mention staff was very rude and unprofessional. Dont waste your time or money. I wouldn't even give one star... [REVIEW_26] Moving and storing possessions important to you is a stressful process. I have found that Nicole is consistently professional; polite and helpful. This is a very busy business so sometimes there is a wait. What I've noticed is that both Nicole and Stacey take their time to make sure the paperwork is complete and that customers understand everything. If you have a short wait; just know that when it's your turn; they will give you the same undivided attention. Nicole has really helped me during a very stressful time. I really appreciate that. [REVIEW_27] We came here on the holiday; July 4.  This place was great.  All the staff were so friendly and helpful.  My daughter had ear pain and the nurse we saw was very compassionate and patient with my daughter.  He tried to do his best to get the wax loose and out of her ear; but was unsuccessful after multiple attempts.  The doctor then came in to assist and immediately was able to remove a huge chunk of wax.  We were given prescriptions for antibiotics and went over to Target (in same shopping center) to get those filled.  The medication was cheaper at Target than what Med Express quoted us.   It was a great place for going to get immediate care while on vacation at the beach!  Thanks so much! [REVIEW_28] This place sucks! The one up on oracle and wetmore is where I usually go; however; I moved and the university location is closer. Sorry Silver mine you have lost my business forever.  First; I ordered two sandwiches a large homesteak  with no green onions. I accidentally typed onions instead of peppers that come on the sandwich. These bozos still proceed to put the greens on it and the manager laughs it off like no big deal.  Second; my hot homesteak sandwich was as cold as if had been sitting out for an hour. You guessed right it took an hour to get my food and then the hot sandwich was not wrapped in the proper wrapping to keep it warm. Lastly; the employee got rude with me when I was checking to see what time my order would be done. He proceeded to scold me about how he only got it two minutes ago and it will be done when its done. Not how you talk to a customer buddy!  Goodbye Silver mine! [REVIEW_29] First let me start off by saying DO NOT go to this business for your special occasion the owner does not care about you! Boy if I could give this business less than one star I would ( I guess the single star can go to the overall look of the inside). Other than that let me tell you about my experience with this business. I booked my boyfriend and I for our first couples massage for his birthday today; Saturday; on Tuesday morning. The person I talked to on the phone seemed to be in a rush but seemed to have gotten all of my information even asking if I was okay with a male and female masseuse. When I went to spell out my name I got a quick ""okay okay"" mid sentence. No big deal. Today when my boyfriend and I got there twenty minutes early for a massage we saw a busy fully booked very busy business. We sat there for probably 5 to 10 minutes before being acknowledged. Still not a big deal they were busy and that's why we got there early for things like this. After the guy got our name he looked at the appointments list repeatedly trying to find our names or numbers he simply said we weren't on the books. There was nothing he could do they were fully booked for the day and then he proceeded to ask me who I spoke to on the phone did she sound Vietnamese because that was the owner she does that all the time to people. She takes there appointment and never writes it down! This was the most ridiculous thing that I have ever heard of. We asked when the owner would be in and he said she was there. Then we asked well won't she do something about this and he just flat out said no. The second most ridiculous thing that I have ever heard. We left at that point. Needless to say I was pissed at this point no massage for us. Birthday ruined. Can't comment on actual paid for services can only speak of owner and employees. [REVIEW_30] Wonderful!!! The portobello po' boy was one of the best I've ever had. A great lunch stop.",18
76,"[REVIEW_1] Can't go wrong with Frady's po-boys.  Then hang out on the corner with a beer. [REVIEW_2] A typical budget motel; but the rooms are very clean with no bugs. Great price for the room. I broke down and was scrambling to find a room; and the two gentlemen at the desk were kind and accommodating.  I would definitely stay here again. [REVIEW_3] We were here drunk as all heck. after closing time. our guys at larry's hooked us up with leftover cheesesteaks and a meatball. not only was this the best drunk experience of our young lives; but we owe our lives to the workers at larry's. god bless; you have our business for life. thank you and god bless. [REVIEW_4] Only open during Fiesta; the first weekend (friday at noon; sat and sun 10am) in August!!! If you are in Santa Barbara at all on this week of celebration and you love authentic Mexican food you must come here!  You will love all the great food they offer here and the dancing and music.  There is beer and wine.  I usually come here for a big bowl of pazole for breakfast; but before I do that you must order some tomales.  Get here early for the tamales because the line gets long.  This place is the real deal.  And not to be missed if your a serious foodie. Viva la Fiesta!!! [REVIEW_5] No complaints with this store. I stop in every time I'm in the legends shopping center to check out the sales. They've always had really good deals here; mainly the buy 1 get 1 half off of classic shoes (which is perfect for me since I can never narrow down my selections in here). I love that they have the toy story collections and the MLB collections ( super bummed they were low on sizes for the San Francisco Giants; but that's to be expected ). I walked out of there with 2 pairs of classic shoes and 2 backpacks for $65. Can't beat that; the shoes were buy 1 get 1 half off and the backpacks were buy 1 get 1 FREE. I was not going to pass that offer up. Now my 5 year old brother and I have matching buz lightyear backpacks! All the staff was friendly; there were 3 girls about my age working. Always offer to check the back room and make sure you're leaving with the best deals possible. [REVIEW_6] Solid burger.  Especially from a chain.  Smash fries are great.   Hagen Daz milk shakes.  Yes please [REVIEW_7] I have been here a few times to buy either ammo or holsters. They do have a big selection of guns and rifles;that i can't get here in the communist state of California. Never had a bad experience here;and they have been helpful. [REVIEW_8] I'm really not sure why I keep going back here-maybe because it's the only subway I know of between City Ave and Wayne; but I should stop. The customer service is worse each time I go back. The woman who works there is incredibly slow and the younger man is slow & rude. I'm not sure why making a sandwich for me is such a burden for someone who works in a sandwich store. But maybe it's because I'm interrupting his chainsmoking.  This morning the man decided that he should take his time to finish preparing his coffee before he got around to making my sandwich. And apparently he isn't clear on the fact that you should wash your hands before you prepare food- gloves or not! Even though it was only about 9:30am when I went there; they were somehow already out of some ingredients. Dont go. [REVIEW_9] I would like to share my experience with the owner of this nail salon. I came in today for a manicure and pedicure. The sign on the door says hot spa pedicures. My water in pedicure and manicure was cold. My nail tech was talking very loudly the entire time; which made it very un-relaxing to me. She was very rough with the pedicure massage and in a very big hurry. Again; not relaxing at all. You advertise a relaxing spa like atmosphere on yoru website and that is not what is provided. When it came time to paint my nails; she missed part of my nails. I have photos of this if you would like to see them. She did not even paint the whole nail and skipped the side. I also asked her to clip down my nails and they are extremely crooked and none of them are the same shape. Instead of asking me if I wanted square or rounded nails; she just clipped of the corners and now I am missing corners on different nails. Her customer service and paint/shaping skills were TERRIBLE! She did not ask me if I liked my nails. She did not come to see if they were dry so I could leave. She did not take my payment. She disappeared into the back and someone else took my payment. Other customers in your salon had an unhappy look on their face. I will not be returning to your salon and you have lost a customer over her very poor work. I do look at getting my nails done as pampering myself; and I should not be treated like this when I am spending my hard earned money on a relaxing nail service that should look good. My nails are now ruined and I have to wait on then to grow out so another salon can fix what she did to me. I will be sharing my experience with all of my friends. [REVIEW_10] Milktooth is the place to go if you want a good breakfast cocktail and a twist on traditional brunch. At first glance of the menu; you may think you've never heard of any of these foods for breakfast; and you may be right. I guarantee no matter what you order; you're going to enjoy it.   Milktooth is one of the most popular brunch places in Indy; which means you will typically have a wait. Trust me; it's worth the usual 30 minute wait (on weekends). To make it go by a little faster; they've got a walk up bar for their coffee drinks and pastries. Snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you're about to have.  Their menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients. I love all of their variations on a Dutch pancake; and their raclette grilled cheese is to die for.  If you're making this a boozy breakfast; don't pass up on the michelada. And sit outside if it's warm enough! [REVIEW_11] this place is pretty much perfect. we go here whenever we are downtown and want to get coffee. the coffee is pretty good. they do espresso. it is verve I've read but they're starting to roast themselves. thats cool. the service and people are nice and the vibe is mellow.  I landed at The French Press once; after being away from Santa Barbara for awhile. I remember sitting at one of their sunny; steel tables outside. Pretty dogs and Santa Barbarans abounded. I sat yesterday on one of their bar seats facing the all-window front; a diorama of Pleasantville spread out before me. Every bit of sunshine and view I took in was assuring me; 'everything is alright; things are good here.' And so it is. I hope The French Press keeps the vibe. [REVIEW_12] Great location; close to all the ""tourist-y"" stuff.  Hotel is beautiful!  You can walk to everything including the Arch and Busch Stadium.  Close to dining.  Felt safe there and the staff was excellent!! [REVIEW_13] This restaurant is on point!!  My husband and I were at the entrance off the lobby just peeking in and one of the managers that was dropping something off stopped us and asked if we wanted to eat.  Only because of her friendly demeanor did we stop and eat.  Love love love this place.  Our waiter; unfortunately cannot remember his name...but he is darling; personable; and wore glasses and was by far the best waiter we have ever had.  The Bloody Mary bar was delish only outdone by the food!!!  OMG!!  Menu was so good and great selection.  The manager on duty came over to greet us and our service dog and told us more about the hotel.  So impressed that we switched our reservations for 2 weeks from Peppeemill to now to staying at Whitney Peaks!!  Keep up the great work and see you in 2 weeks!!!! [REVIEW_14] Stopped in when I found them On yelp. Why drive to the Hill when you have the same great food right here? Had the house salad and the monster Italian beef and sausage sandwich for lunch. Both were excellent highly recommend. I will stop in the next time I'm in town. [REVIEW_15] Started with a few drinks. Nice custom cocktail selection. Waitress was real nice and went through the menu with us. It's almost all shared plates. Very trendy; cool concept rarely pulled off well. Started with buffalo pork belly and meatballs. Pork belly was really good. Good; spicy and fatty ( you have to be into that thing). Meatballs were excellent. The only thing I would have wanted were toast points or crustinis to dip in the left over sauce. The margarita pizza was awesome wood fired; thin sauce (which I believe belongs on a pizza) and a doughy thin crust. Finished up with some vanilla and Nutella gelato. Great meal! We'll be back! [REVIEW_16] Cute pet store with a nice variety of natural pet foods. My cats' wet food is 10 cents less a can here compared to Petco. Happy to have just moved within walking distance; will definitely be my new place for pet supplies. [REVIEW_17] This place completely exceeded my expectations; and I had a great experience. The space and equipment were very clean; the therapist was strong and responsive; and pricing schedule is very fair- the best deal in town for trained massage. Also; I was a walk-in and they saw me in less than 5 minutes. [REVIEW_18] Steve is reliable and good at his job. Not sure what else you could want from a home services commonly? He shows up when he says he will; prepared and personable. When something looks dicey; he will tell you rather than going ahead and doing it anyway. For example; I had a canvas painting I wanted him to hang at my home. When he realized the frame was bent; he showed me immediately and told me once it was hung it would look worse. He is a gentleman and I was never uncomfortable alone in the house with him. Can't recommend Steve and Sierra Home Services enough! [REVIEW_19] 5 Star AUTHENTIC Jamaican food. Tougher location but the Jamaican vibes are worth a visit. We had them cater our wedding rehearsal dinner. All of the guests (most have never had jerk) were very impressed with the meal! Jerk pork; jerk chicken; rice & peas; beef patties; DG brand drinks; they have it all.  We drive an hour and a half to stop at the walk up window just to enjoy the food.   Orda di jerk grab a DG and enjoy di vibes; every ting is Irie! [REVIEW_20] Food: The best selection of bruschetta.  My favorite is the goat cheese and pesto unfortunately for some reason they took that off the menu - which I'd like to go on record as saying I am upset about that.  My second favorite (which is still on the menu) is the Pistachio herbed Ricotta with Lavender Honey.  Tria's food is on the lighter side.  Usually when I go with someone else we load up on brushetta and cheese and split a panino.  One of my favorites is the Smoked Chicken panino.  During happy hour they have good beer specials.  If you don't feel like drinking while you there I recommend the passionberry iced tea.  It's bottomless - can't beat that.  Service: I've been here countless times and never had a problem with the service.  Everyone is nice and the food comes out quickly.  Ambiance: It depends which one you go to.  The one around 13th is bigger and has nice heated outside seating.  The one at 17th and sansom is smaller and since you can't make a reservation you have to get there before 5 to get a table.  The inside are both are basically the same.  Hardwood floors and a nice bar.  Candle at the table.  It can get a bit loud but other than that it's a nice place to eat. [REVIEW_21] All earlier reviews were erased! so....Easily the best florist in the city! Michael; the owner; and his staff are absolute sweethearts and great at customer satisfaction. I am regular here; getting flowers for my sweetie at least twice a month and the staff always treat me like an old friend! Great selection of home goods and cool unusual plants.  Always helpful with any questions regarding plants and gardening; these guys rock. They do window boxes and small backyards as well; but beware they get booked up quickly so give them some time to get to you. [REVIEW_22] Great place for happy hour. Oysters were deLISH! My friend and I had 2 dozen and we had some cocktails! The riverbend and champagne au poir we quite tasty. I had a side of fries and she had a side a grits. Best grits I've eaten. Definitely coming back. The server was great too. Just the right amount of attention! [REVIEW_23] Love this place! Come here frequently with friends for the coconut cake and a cup of coffee :) [REVIEW_24] Really good Pho!   Like; really good Pho.   The Thai Coffee is on point ... and bubble tea... oh; yeah... fantastic bubble tea! [REVIEW_25] This is such a cute place!! Perfect for a date; which is why I went here after searching high and low for nice brunch places in the area. I came here for that very reason in the summer and it was wonderful. My boyfriend got the mini waffles; which were soooo good. I had a pot of tea; I can't recall what flavor but they brought out quite the selection for me to choose from; and were so patient in waiting for me to decide. I think I also had an omelette. I do recall liking what I ordered. The ambience and service is what blew me away; and I'd definitely come back and check out the display case of pastries at some point. I also got a really nice fluffy biscuit with yummy honey butter. I would go back and would recommend it to friends :). [REVIEW_26] The best Italian I have had in years (and I'm Italian!!). Owner David is so friendly and makes everyone feel like his best friend. And it's not fake; it's genuine and fun! [REVIEW_27] Yum.  I love to swing by Smiley's on my way home from work and pick up a vegetarian falafel platter. Their falafel is perfection! Far; far better than Couch Tomato (no surprise there since this is a Mediterranean joint). Prices are fair; food is super fresh. Their hummus is silky with just a hint of lemon. Yes; carryout can take a little while but everything is made to order so I'm happy to wait or just call ahead. Do not miss this great little place!! [REVIEW_28] Outstanding! They have great gluten-free and vegan options too. The salad; pizza; and root beer were just perfect. [REVIEW_29] This is my favorite restaurant in the world. Hands down.  Here's why:  1- Old and nothing has changed 2- The cheeseburger. It's a fish place; I know -  trust me; get the cheeseburger 3- The smoked fish spread appetizer 4- Root beer /draft beer in ice-cold mugs 5- Touring the fish house 6- Oh; and the german potato salad  For real; this place will change your life. [REVIEW_30] We had lunch here on 12/20. Maui burger was flavorful; juicy and thick. Choc. shakes very good and thick. Calamari had good flavor; really good with lemon squeezed on. Fish & chips was great; very tender and flavorful. All & all; we really enjoyed our stop here!",28
77,"[REVIEW_1] It's a dollar to add an extra sauce for the wings; and this is with no warning from the waitress.  Kind if annoying to get the receipt and see that. It was also difficult to flag her down. Still; she was friendly and polite and the order was accurate. Food was delicious. We got the wings; potato skins and their famous spinach dip. Everything was cooked to perfection. Generous portions. Food came in about 20 minutes while we drank . Beer was tasty and went down easily. I liked the selection. Happy hour was nice with a dollar off drafts and half price apps. [REVIEW_2] Happened upon this place (visiting family from out of town) and were happy to get a quick and yummy bite before heading to meet up with family. It's a small little place with a lot of classic Italian dishes; some sandwiches and St. Louis-style pizza options. My husband and I split a sandwich and got Italian wedding soup to go with it!   The lady at the counter was super nice and friendly. Would definitely recommend stopping in!   Parking is in the lot and sandwiches are about $10. There are $10 lunch specials too. [REVIEW_3] Amazing place for good fun. Got engaged last night and brought my now fiance with me to the n crowd. Asked if they could do a little shout out for her. Not only did they do a shout out they did a skit renacting her entire day. Was hilarious and really made the night extra special. Highly recommend the N Crowd to anyone who likes to laugh and have fun. A++++++ [REVIEW_4] NO WAY I know others like this place ;I'm sorry to say it was awful. The soup was ok; not filled up; looked like they didn't want to splurge with filling up to look decent.  the salad looked like they opened a bag of salad  dribbled it on then grabbed some off.  the garlic bread is full of jared garlic and oil  will make your stomach sick. my son ordered lasagna ; who knows what was in it  and i ordered pasta w/ broccoli it tasted like it was sitting in salt water and that was only flavor. when they found out i didn't like it the owner or someone; picked up my plate and with his fingers grabbed the spaghetti  and put it in his mouth ; need I say more how disgusting . Over priced and was awful. [REVIEW_5] Was taken here today by a Colombian friend who needed to satisfy a craving for something cheap and delicious. This place reminds me of Nanzhou; a Yelp favorite; because of the heaping helpings you get for next to nothing.   I got the oxtail soup (Sancocho) with extra rice and plantains to see how it would differ from the Korean-style stuff I was used to at home. Aside from a thicker; stew-like broth and beefier potatoes; it was just as delicious. My friend got a flat steak (Carne Asada) that I think he ate in just under 10 seconds.   Remember Yelp; you're missing out on a lot if you don't visit NE philly once in a while; especially this place. [REVIEW_6] One of my favorite breakfast joints in Nash! Love bringing fam here when I have them in town! Amazing bloody Mary's & biscuits! Well worth the wait; always!! [REVIEW_7] This place has gone downhill in a hurry.  When it first opened; the donuts were actually good and had creative toppings.  Now they have creative topping but the actual donuts don't taste fresh.  They have opened up a few locations and now the quality at the original location isn't there. [REVIEW_8] Food was delish and tasty; but more importantly - service was superb! We asked if the restaurant served wine; and they told us it was BYOB. So a few minutes after sitting down; hubby and I got dressed to go out and get smthg in nearby bar - that's when owner told us he found a bottle of wine and gave it to us on the house! That was so nice; genuine and thoughtful! Excellent; cozy; yummy place for lunch; with warm hospitality -highly recommend! [REVIEW_9] NOT KID FRIENDLY!  Came here tonight with my toddler and newborn and was joined by a few sets of parent friends with their young children. The staff was nice; but the clientele were not welcoming to children and made rude comments. Let's just say that a scene ensued and we showed ourselves out of this unwelcoming establishment.  The beer is average as far as breweries in the city are concerned. There's plenty of options with better beer; better vibes; better clientele; and way better suited for families trying to have fun with their kids.  We regularly visit the breweries of New Orleans and decided to try this place out for the sake of trying them all. We can say with certainty that they will never see our business or the business of our friends again due to the way their clientele treat families with children.  If you want Kid friendly; go to: URBAN SOUTH; SECOND LINE; PARLEAUXS - All have a great selection of beer; great staff; great space for you and your kids to have fun; amazing customers; and great food options daily. [REVIEW_10] Well.... The food is good love the spicy mayo the employee are nice but the owner Wes is horrible I came in Last week to order tempura chicken they changed there Menu so she said get a child one for 7 I was fine with that it came with a lot of stuff which I don't eat I just eat the tempura so they gave me Just Chicken on a plate it used to be 3.99 for tempura and you got 4 pieces now it's different so I received my food this jacka$$ Wes comes in and saw my meal which like I said was only chicken and tells the waitress charge her 12 dollars for it Huh?? So I feel this is so unprofessional and rude last time I step foot in there they told me one price and I'm charged a different I'm very upset he needs to practice better owner relations cause it sucks last time for me and the chicken was over cooked SMH!!!! [REVIEW_11] This bakery is amazing; from the decor to the quality of the service.  Come to the frosted fox for friendky service from thr owners and then try one of their delicious desserts.  the prices are incredibly reasonable. The biggest problem is figuring out what you want to order. I recommend the giant snicker doodle cookie or the m&m cookie. Both were amazing and you really can't go wrong! [REVIEW_12] What a great tour; very informative.  My family and I wasn't planning on going on the Budweiser Brewery tour but since we were in town we just had to go; plus it was free. I'm not much of a beer drinker but do drink every now and then but this tour was very interesting.  Our guide was very good and threw in some jokes from time to time which mainly was focused on the Chicago Cubs.    As for the reviewer mentioning about not bring babies or toddlers; my 3 year old daughter loved the tour; so much was going on around her that she was distracted.  Of course she just had to have a stuff Clydesdale in the gift shop.   Some people are on vacation or trip and don't have a ""sitter"".    Great tour; will do this again next time we are in town. [REVIEW_13] Just wow.  Other Philadelphia restauranteurs...eat a meal at Aldine and take notes. Fantastic vibe; super friendly and knowledgeable staff; and superb fresh seasonal cuisine. [REVIEW_14] Our first time here and it was excellent.  Very fresh ingredients and flavorful.  We had two different soups; chicken satay and pad Thai with amazing mango sticky rice for dessert.  We look forward to many return trips here. [REVIEW_15] I love their rolls! :) I go here often; and I usually get a unagi and eel roll or a crunch roll. Their teriyaki chicken is really delicious too! ;-) Parking is a little difficult; I found... [REVIEW_16] This review is solely for the hostess Meg who displayed awful customer service.    My friends and I planned to come to Sabrina's for brunch.  I currently live in the Pittsburgh area.  So when I am home; I love coming to Collingswood for some delicious eats.  I had a positive experience the last time I was at Sabrina and was hoping to create more since I was asking my friends to be in my bridal party.  There are no reservations for brunch on Sabrina's on the weekend but they will accept at least a 30-45 min call aheads for a party.  My friend did a call ahead for ten am. My friends tend to struggle with being on time and there is a policy that everyone has to be there to be seated.  The policy makes sense and I was open to the hostess that we were at fault for not all being there.   My friends didn't all show up until 10:40.  There was no table available which was fine since we were late.  But I was not okay with the hostess rudeness towards us.  She told us that we never did the call ahead despite the verified text from the restaurant saying we called ahead on my friend's phone.  We let that comment go since we were taking ownership that we were not all there on time.  She told us that the wait would be about 30-45 minutes and they will text us when the table is open.  She told us to go walk around since there was a farmers market happening close by the restaurant.  She also reminded us that the whole party had to be here.  I don't mind the reminder but again her tone was rude towards us.  We let it go again because we were at fault for our struggle with timeliness.   We take a walk and about ten minutes later we get a text that the table is ready.  We get back quickly and wait in line since there was people checking in/getting seated in front of us.  When it is our turn; the hostess tells us we missed our five minute mark and the wait was going to be a 15-30 minute wait.  Again her tone was rude and this time we were not at fault.  Her time said we arrived there six minutes after the text.  Okay this means... we were on time but we waited patiently in line for people in front of us to check in/be seated.  Which means the hostess did not wait and sat people at our table.   I initially was going to let it go but her rudeness was leaving not a good feeling.  My friend argues with her because it was not fair we were being blamed for something that was her fault this time.  Also she told us to go for a walk since the wait was going to be 30-45 minutes?!  The arguing was not worth it and I told my friends we were leaving.  We went to the tortilla press across the street.  It was a great decision; since the food was super delicious and the customer service was much more friendlier towards us. [REVIEW_17] Disgustingly over priced. They have a wonderful; mouth watering beer selection but c'mon. This is not even NY prices. I realize PA law is part of the problem here but Foodery beer prices are just too high. I have been on boycott for years. I would rather go to one of the great beer bars around or pick up beer in NJ than give this place my $ [REVIEW_18] Good food; but to me it's not worth the horrible service or the rude staff; and they only take cash or checks and there's not even a sign at the front stating so; the sign is at their cash register all the way in the back on a wall not facing the dining room. I'm not very picky and I'm never rude; so this says a lot: horrible experience. [REVIEW_19] we haven't even stayed here yet; and this establishment has already created a bad impression!  our family booked a 3 night weekend over the 4th of july via hotwire and i called the reservations desk to confirm.  the hyatt person was supremely snotty (thanks; susan) and kept interrupting me to say ""is there anything else i can help you with?!"" in order to imply that i was bothering her.    our requests were simple: 2 beds (we're bringing our twins) and to make a note of our late check-in.  ""and will that be ALL?"" the reservations person asked.  because this is a special visit for our girls; i asked if it would be possible to have a room facing the arch.  to which she LAUGHED and then replied ""no.  you'll need to pay extra for that.""  we expect to be treated with basic courtesy when patronizing any business.  needless to say; we are NOT looking forward to our stay here this weekend. [REVIEW_20] Best BBQ joint I've found in Nashville. The pulled pork BBQ is amazing. The bartender is awesome and the banana pudding; OMG. Let's talk about the banana pudding. It's ridiculous. I always leave needing a nap I get so full. Check it out. [REVIEW_21] I don't normally give a place 5 stars based on how good their food tastes; but that damn grilled chicken club is so ridiculously good.  I just couldn't help myself.  They also have a pretty good nacho appetizer.  I'm serious. [REVIEW_22] My girlfriend and I accidentally showed up for our first visit on a Tuesday; the one day they are closed! I was going to turn around; but my girlfriend insisted on taking a peek and she knocked on the door anyways. Well; the owners happened to be there; and they not only opened up for us; but also made us exactly what we wanted and let us dine in while having great conversation! The taste was 5-stars. The healthiness was 5-stars. The hospitality was priceless! [REVIEW_23] I would not bother spending money on the drinks here. They lack the necessary selection for a coffee house. Even their signature drink is overly and needlessly sweet and lacks any real flavor. I can't speak for their food but from what I saw; is overpriced. [REVIEW_24] If you have not had their cream filled donuts then you simply have not lived; my friend! Incredible! I came to Philly to visit my sister and she brought us here on our second to last day. The cream filled doughnut was so incredible that I drove all the way back here on our way home to get a half dozen of them for the drive back to Michigan! And if you're wondering...yes; yes I crushed all 6 of those delicious pieces of heaven and I won't apologize for it! [REVIEW_25] The best fried rice ever! Also the best Pho I had while in Nashville. I'm from Seattle so I'm a little spoiled in that department. If you're looking for a good place to try it for the first time or just looking for a good Vietnamese restaurant; GO! [REVIEW_26] Went for Brunch after a day of Jazzfest and a night on the town with old friends. They brought a full french press of coffee just what I needed to start the meal. The server was not as attentive as I would have liked and I had to ask for water several times. But the hostess/manager was very friendly and chatted with us for a bit. The pace of the meal was perfect long enough to digest and enjoy between courses.  The setting is beautiful it feels very retro with the old fans; tin roofs; and dark wood. The boudin noir was delicious. Followed by crawfish bisque with stuffed crawfish which taste perfectly seafoody with a hint of spices very subtle layered flavors. The Gumbo was also very good. I had beef short rib were tender but the presentation was a bit weak. The other meals were more of visual masterpieces. The crabmeat omelet was delicious and the home made fries were perfect. The grits were very creamy.and the pan fried trout was fabulous. This a really great place to come to try out John Besh food on without the hefty price tag. [REVIEW_27] Terrible delivery service & food order was incorrect once received an hour over what I was told.  All the food was under or over cooked.  Never again!  Sad [REVIEW_28] Just love the grits; can't find these anywhere else in Reno-Sparks.  Spinach Mozzarella; pepper jack!  Yumm  Good tri-tip- not chewy and BBQ chicken in either a sandwich or wrap.  Super nice folks too. True family operation. [REVIEW_29] 25 Sep 2018  We went in and found the establishment was worn. It was difficult to read the menu. The menu did not say one could purchase an individual piece of chicken. The lady behind the counter was as slow as molasses in the wintertime.  When we finely stepped up to the counter the employee was unable to address my questions about the menu. Her speech was inaudible.  I asked if she spoke english; I'm pretty sure she did; but not very well. My wife and I walked out without ordering.  We will not be back. [REVIEW_30] I've been here several times both for a sit down brunch and to grab a quick piece of cake to take home. Brunch/ Dinner: make a reservation! It fills up quickly as there is limited space; especially when the patio isn't open. My favorite menu item is their quiche which changes daily but I've never had one I didn't like! I'm also a big fan of their tea. It comes in a cute little Cake Bake teapot and they have a really great selection.   Now for the desserts: I've had several and you cannot go wrong!!! Cake; cookies; pies; brownies....They are all delicious and visually appealing as well (several glitter items!). The atmosphere is pretty magical and worth the trip!  It can get a little pricey so definitely an every now and then treat.",19
78,"[REVIEW_1] I think its funny that my car needed a jump infront of their shop on broad street and i was told No because of not being able to leave the store. When asked if another employee could help he said no he is about to leave. I then asked if he can give me a jump when he leaves and i also got a NO. Funny how theycservice cars; help people with cars but cant even give me a jump. Lame service. Not customer oriented at all. Typical fat guy behind the counter surfing the web and playin on his phone. The worst [REVIEW_2] We ate in. Awful pizza.  Shared the Philly steak pizza with bacon on the side.  Pizza was oily and soggy with little sauce and no flavor. Got sauce on the side and it was so watery as to be a liability.  Bacon was just heated bacon bits (worst I ever had) with no taste but lots more grease.  We were the ONLY customers eating in the entire time. Only sound was the overloud music.  Waiter was just one of the kitchen workers who was; however; very accommodating when he was available.  If you decide to go; I wish you much better luck.  Rating on pizza = minus 2.5 [REVIEW_3] Rating were good. But still waiting for our dinner .   Extremely slow service ..appetizer and drinks were mediocre at best .  Was really looking forward to this meal. But would never recommend . Hope dinner shows up before sunrise .. [REVIEW_4] I've been here several times and my cat Toothless is under one of their Wellness Plans. The vet techs and vets are always very nice and helpful when it comes to checking her in; and unless there's a difficult case ahead of me; the check in is always quick and easy. They're also very good about contacting me when someone new or a potential problem comes up; and they call if they need to run any other checks. The price is a little much which is an issue with any vet that I've noticed; but they always treat Toothless very well and I've never had any problems with them. [REVIEW_5] Come here to have drinks made by a bartender who doesn't care about the integrity of their craft!  What seems like a great cocktail program executed by amateurs. Came in the evening of 01/01/18 and ordered a drink that was a floral riff on the Last Word. After straining my drink into the glass; my bartender exchanged baffled looks with his barback and poured gin directly into the glass. I'm not stupid; so I asked what the ingredient was and why he added it after the fact. ""It's lavender Gin and I didn't put enough."" Well; my friend; this resulted in an improperly diluted and room temperature 'cocktail'. I even mentioned that it was not as cold as it should have been and the solution was to add ice to my coupe glass. COME ON. At what point is it appropriate to ask to jump behind the bar and just make your drink yourself?  Just because half the people in NoLA don't know the difference between a good drink and a hole in the ground isn't an excuse to be lazy. Do it right or go home. [REVIEW_6] I would've given it no stars at all if this were an option. My wife ordered cheesecake and coffee. The cheesecake was ridiculously tiny and the coffee tasted like dirt. I ordered a chicken pesto sandwich which was simply about-to-go-bad chicken on stale bread. The only Ok thing about this restaurant was the veggies; they did look and taste fresh. But that's about it. I do not recommend at all. [REVIEW_7] I have been several times and it has been adequate. The last two times I have been there it has been TERRIBLE. The portions have diminished and the quality of the dishes have followed suit. I mean to a detrimental degree. I would not recommended dining here. [REVIEW_8] So I'm walking around looking for a place to eat and stop in here because it's not a chain type place; looks local. So I sit by the fish tank in the middle of a bunch of dirty tables; order some food from a menu the I had to get myself and has to many items on it for everything be good so I play it safe and order a beer and some fried food. I'm sitting at the table for 10mins Questioning why I'm not drinking my beer the bar was not busy and the bartender was not busy so I just walked out. [REVIEW_9] I was trying to find a decent place for dinner tonight for my moderately health conscious self when I came across this place. After figuring out what I wanted and put the Be My Bison burger in my cart for the online order; I realized it would be over a two mile round trip excursion from my job. Defeated; I started to search elsewhere but I could not get that burger off of my mind. I came back a few hours later and submit my order. I hiked it there and it just came out of the kitchen as I walked in.  I grabbed my burger and continued on my way back to work. O-M-G! Absolutely in love with this place. It has been quite the task to try and find healthy places that fit my diet but this is a dream come true! Thank You! [REVIEW_10] Just had a Big Island Açaí bowl and it was amazing!!!  Definitely a treat you should try! [REVIEW_11] I would not advise staying at this hotel. I called to speak to a manager after my friend put the post below and the manager was once again; very rude. [REVIEW_12] Tried this place the other day the pizza was not very good at all the place before this one was so much better all home made food with it would've stuck around [REVIEW_13] Cashier was rude and black and blue salad was partially frozen. Mostly brown pieces of lettuce and all for $9... no thanks. ""Steak"" was less than 3 oz. very poor quality and obviously no manager to oversee. [REVIEW_14] Bella Vista Designs is the best lighting/event production company in town! I have seen their work at several dozen events and each one was impressive and flawless.   From the office correspondence; to the friendly and hard working installation crew; nothing but professionalism and cool people. No job too big (like the Santa Barbara Film Festival); no job too small (like the time that they did three string lights at a small party for my parents 50th wedding anniversary in my backyard !)  They work hard for you and will always work with you to make sure your needs are met and you are happy. Hands down; great company and great team. [REVIEW_15] I have heard tons of good feedback from people about this restaurant and have planned to go eat there because of it. But i feel a bit disappointed in their customer service; i had been calling for a week for their catering services and no one ever called or texted me like they said; they didn't have prices to offer and only one person apparently does their catering quotes. If you offer catering and want to gain profit you should have something set. I ended up having to get a diff person to do it but was looking forward to their tacos. A bit bummed; maybe in the future i might eat there but I'm dissatisfied in my service as a potential client. [REVIEW_16] We were VERY disappointed with West Side Gravy.  My fried chicken was two small legs and a thigh; all undercooked;  served in a paper cone; with very small sides of tasteless potato salad and so-so coleslaw.  My iced tea tasted sour.  My wife had the lobster roll which was quite small and tasted mediocre at best.  My son had a hamburger and fries which was fine.  The service was adequate; but nothing special.  Not worth the $50+ (plus tip).  We will not return . The big reason for our disappointment is the fact that The Blackbird Restaurant (attached) is run by the same chef; share the same kitchen and the Blackbird is terrific. [REVIEW_17] After coming here for many years; I was very disappointed by my last trip. The one place you never cut corners is in the food; and that's exactly what they did. 2 of the 3 salsas were so watery that you didn't get any tomatillo or tomato on your chip; at all. The third salsa; the pics de gallo; was the worst chop job I've ever seen in a restaurant. Huge pieces of Serrano pepper with varying sizes of everything else; and in stark contrast to the other 2; completely dried out.   Without even looking at the menu; I know what I want... #15. That decision hasn't changed for over 10 years. Today I should have made a different choice. I'm not sure if they recently went thru a purveyor change but the quality of everything on the plate was horrible.   I used to love the rice; it changed. I used to love the chicken quesadilla; now it's flavorless and covered in 2 lbs of cheese for 1/2 a breast.  Please go back to your old ways and cut costs elsewhere; other than the food. [REVIEW_18] I lived in Philadelphia about 10 years ago and loved Dmitris.  It was always a long wait but the food was great and service good.  I was back in town for a 15th year college reunion and decided to reminisce by coming here again on a MONDAY night for a good friend's birthday celebration.  When I arrived at 6:30pm - the restaurant had many empty seats.  We were a party of 5 but only 3 of us arrived early.  We were seated immediately.  The rest of the party came about 20 minutes later.  After 5 minutes - our waitress came over with an irritated ""Is the rest of your party coming soon?""  After another 5 minutes - they basically said very rudely ""Where are they?""  Meanwhile - there were still MANY empty tables (another table of 5 open) - I looked and there was nobody waiting.    When the rest of the party arrived; the waitress came over immediately to announce the specials of the day before my brother's butt touch his seat!  They're undercurrent was still hostile at best.  The restaurant did not fill up until 30 minutes after our entire party arrived and no more than 2 people were waiting at a time to be seated the entire time we were there.  I felt that the waitresses were rude and acted like it was some kind of sacred privilege to eat at Dmitris.  To add insult to injury - the food was NOT the way I remembered it.  The grilled octopus was dry and did not taste fresh.  The rest of the dishes were okay-good but not spectacular.  I feel that Dmitris is resting on its previous laurels.  I read a few yelp reviews and many complained about the rude waitstaff.  I will not patronized this establishment again and informed my Philly friends and family of the same.  This is America and who wants to pay to eat at a snooty mediocre place? [REVIEW_19] Have ordered take out from here twice. This is one of the two best Indian restaurants I've been to in Bucks County (the other being Cafe Bombay in Bristol) -- everything tastes fresh; and you can taste the ingredients (as compared with so many places where the meals basically just have one note). Highly recommend this place. [REVIEW_20] Four of us just had hibachi dinners at Megu in Cherry Hill.  Unbelievably disappointing.  For some reason the waitress just ignored the four of us.  She took orders from multiple people around us; who had come in after we sat down and started delivering food to their tables before she ever came to our section of the hibachi table or acknowledged us.  I had to get the manager to get served.  The hibachi chef was one of the least skilled that I have ever seen.  One in our party ordered filet mignon.  He cooked all the dinners at our table; then after he served everyone realized that he hadn't cooked the filet; cooked it and gave it to the wrong person.  My friend didn't realize the mistake.  However; my wife pointed it out to me after we left.  Let me also mention that the place looks very worn and unkempt.  needless to say we will not be back.  Do yourself a favor and eat at any number of other Japanese restaurants that know what quality and good service mean. [REVIEW_21] Wallet was stolen today at this starbucks.  The workers there were not helpful at all.  They wanted me to ""file a report"" to corporate and would call if it showed up.  Meanwhile someone was having fun with my credit card in cherry hill; new jersey.  And they made it seem like it was my fault that it was stolen; but it was stolen when i was sitting with my items. Not helpful or sympathetic. [REVIEW_22] The food and service were just like the old days at Tony Angelo's.  This time we had the marinated mushrooms; lobster cup (now a seafood cup and veal parm.). Next trip will definitely be the the Feed Me. [REVIEW_23] You've got a lotta nerve calling your place New York Pizza. First and foremost; the very worst pizza I've ever had in New York is a million times better than anything to ever be produced by this poor excuse of a pizza place. New York Pizza; PLEASE! What you make can barely be called pizza; period. And for all of you people giving more stars; I don't know what they are paying you; but I hope it is a lot. And it you are not being paid; PLEASE; get out more; and go some place good; cause this ain't it. [REVIEW_24] After reading reviews we headed for Herbie's for brunch yesterday. 'Sorry to say it was a big disappointment. We waited  15 minutes to place a drink order and it took another 20 minutes for the drinks to arrive. They must have driven to the brewery to get that Bud Light. A Bloody Mary can't possibly take that long to make; can it? Our food was good but lukewarm.  Eggs Benedict just taste better when they are hot.  We won't be back. [REVIEW_25] Went on a Monday to have a daiquiri and watch a little bit of the NBA basketball game.  Asked the young lady working if she would be willing to turn on the game and was told she was watching Netflix.  I guess customer service is not important anymore.  Won't ever go back. [REVIEW_26] Don't waste your money and time! Although they have an attractive price of $21 for buffet but it's a rip off! I came here with my family tonight. It was a get together and we had 24 people in our party. We didn't expect too much since the price was very reasonable for sushi and korean food; however; we were extremely disappointed by the quality of the food. Nothing tastes fresh; and that's pretty scary when serving sushi. Additionally; most of the trays were either empty or only had little portion of food on them. We saw other tables eating raw oysters but when we went up to grab some there were none. We then waited and didn't see any come out for 20 minutes. We then asked the waiter to check and after 45 minutes a chef brought about 10 oysters out. He then said ""that's it; no more"" in a rude tone of voice. When my aunt asked one of the chefs if he would bring more out. These were his exact words: ""this is a buffet; not oyster buffet"". We asked the waiter if we could speak to the boss and the waiter said that chef was the boss. Really? That's how you treat customers? I'm pretty sure they won't be in business for long. I suggest going elsewhere! [REVIEW_27] I've done a lot of business with Cristalvetro over the past 7 years and never had a problem until recently. I sent in an order with a deposit back in February; and never heard from them. When I started to follow up a few months ago they never returned my calls or emails. I eventually went into their storefront and was told that my top was in their Brooklyn warehouse and could get delivered the following week; I called to follow up on the delivery and was told that the top was damaged and they could not deliver it and would remake it. That made me think that they were lying about having it ready at all. I gave it a few more weeks and heard nothing after many more unanswered calls and emails. At this point I doubt I will ever get my table top or my deposit from them; I will not do business with them again. [REVIEW_28] Went in with a friend for a bite to eat before doing some bar hopping. For some reason the menu to me seemed somewhat limited but I might be alone on that. It's not pricey but for the type of food they serve I feel like it's slightly over priced and in my opinion that food wasn't out of this world. It was average at best. We tipped our waitress 15% and she was slightly rude to us on the way out. Overall not a fan...there's much better places out there to spend your money. [REVIEW_29] The beignets were so bad that we didn't even eat them. They tasted like fried shrimp and were tough as well. The pralines were gritty; but tasty. Also; the computer/register was down so no drinks available from the bar. We offered to pay cash; but this was beyond their capacity and the request was met with silence. The courtyard was lovely though and the staff courteous. But it was such a disappointment on our first stop of our first day to New Orleans. [REVIEW_30] If I could leave negative stars then I absolutely would. I waited for a long time for my pizza in a relatively empty restaurant then walked up and was handed a BURNING HOT pie that I couldn't carry. Mind you I worked in food service for 6 years and I myself would never carry a pizza that temperature. After dropping a scalding pizzas I was called "" stupid"" and then given the impression they would remake my pizza. After waiting 20 minutes; I followed up with them. The assistant manager then told me it was all my fault and I'd be lucky if I got a couple pieces. End of story is worst custom service ever!",6
79,"[REVIEW_1] We had low expectations thinking that this place might cater to partying college students as the photos on their website seem to portray; but we were pleasantly surprised on all levels by Americano.  We ordered the Dates with Pork Belly; Chorizo Con Pan; The Blistered Tomatoes Con Pan; the Mushrooms Con Pan and the Fried Manchego with the jalapeno blackberry sauce and were were stuffed. Looking forward to going back for some paella soon. We ordered the margarita swirl with blood orange and the mango mojito. Both had nice flavor. I would only suggest that the mojito be strained and garnished with a whole mint leaf or such since the jalapeno pieces; seeds and tiny mint shreds kept getting stuck in the straw etc..but delicious anyway.  The patio had a nice cross breeze and our service was excellent. David was training another server that night so we had double the service!   There is plenty of parking in the back; and in the front lot; after the bank is closed; you can use those spots too; but they don't say that on the signs. We are looking forward to returning! [REVIEW_2] I bought the Groupon massage as well.  When I called; they said they were booked out to the second week of October and my Groupon expires Oct. 2nd.  Not impressed at all.  It sounds like the massage isn't worth it anyways from the review here. [REVIEW_3] Awful awful awful went in today to have lunch with my husband we ordered we get to the register and they inform us there's no ice for the drinks we ordered do we still want them I say yes because I made the wrongful assumption that the soda would at least be cold and drinkable boy was I wrong not only was it hot but it had no carbonation what so ever. Now mine you we paid for these drinks I don't know about you but I've worked in the food industry and my store has ran out of ice before and we went to the grocery store and bought bags of ice brought them back and made sure our customers were happy until we could fix the situation apparently that was not the managers idea at this store. So instead of just saying sorry our drink situation sucks today u can have it for free they charge us. I went to 5 guys and got us cold drinks we started eating our burritos were disgusting they tasted like cat food and the chips were completely plain no lime or salt at all! Clearly someone has dropped the ball at this chipotle because it was complete garbage! I hope they can turn this store around because they've now lost a customer [REVIEW_4] If I could add a star; this one would get more. We set outside overlooking the gulch. Food was excellent; and service was excellent. A little on the expensive side; but well worth it. [REVIEW_5] Went here today and it was terrible. Sam is always character which is sometimes entertaining; and the lunch special is priced nicely- but thats the only good I have to say about this place.   I ordered the california and nashville rolls (i wanted the spider roll but I guess he was out of crab; or didnt want to make it) and my friend got spicy tuna and something with shrimp. Sam totally messed up the order. The spicy tuna ended up with my california rolls but i just dove in; unaware of the mixup. I cant even handle mild salsa so when i ate the tuna; it was so hot; i almost threw up; started crying and sweating- it was an awful experience. I tried to eat a california roll but my mouth hurt so bad; i couldn't taste anything and I totally lost my appetite. We didnt even bother trying to get sam to fix the order.  It was a terrible experience all because sam didnt write any of the three seperate orders down that he took at the same time. I think i'd prefer to go to bar down Printer's Alley than back to sam's for a meal. [REVIEW_6] Absolutely disgusting. Do yourself a favor and never order from here. Food is terrible [REVIEW_7] Was contacted by this company from an inquiry I did for a moving quote for North American Moving Company.  The representative came to my house on Monday and it took 4 days for actually to receive the moving quote estimate.  When received the quote saw many charges on it for services that I didn t asked for and things in it that never seen before on an estimate.  When called the representative about this had no clue about any of the charges.    To me seems that they are a rip off company and trying to make the most money possible the easiest way !    I advice anyone to stay away from this company and do your research well before deciding to hire any moving company.    Oh; I also forgot that the moving quote I received was outrageous and ridiculous ! [REVIEW_8] Let's start with my first impression ... it wasn't great.  On the door walking in there are images of the credit cards they accept but when you walk to the counter there is a hand written sign that says something to the effect of we do not accept credit cards use the ATM next door.   I told my husband we would need to go elsewhere to eat then. At this point some guy came up to take our order; we commented on the credit card thing and he gave ranted at us for a good while about giving away money because the rate was 3.69% per sale and he cant afford to pay it and the electric and this and that. Like ok whatever dude; you're in business as is the bank you agreed to their terms and conditions when you had it installed to run your business.   He then handed us a menu and said we could order it off of the web from foodcab.net.  At this point I was pretty much over this guys bad attitude and wanted to just walk out of there but my husband was pretty upset as he really wanted BBQ so we ordered off line from the foodcab.net since we could use our credit card.   When we finally got the food to us it was bland and dry. even my cat turned her nose up too it. The corn bread was less like a side dish and more like a dessert.   I physically feel ill after eating this slop as does my husband. [REVIEW_9] Lee is the man. I took my tailoring needs to another tailor only to be exceptionally disappointed by the work that was done. I brought the items to Lee and he fixed the problems. Not only is he great at what he does; he is a very honest and nice man. [REVIEW_10] This review is about the receptionist.  Normally I have a decent experience here; but this morning I  called to schedule an appt for the same night at 7:45. The lady up sold me on a special; said ""see you tonight;"" and we ended our conversation.   Got to the salon and was informed my services were scheduled for tomorrow; not tonight. Well; im going away tomorrow; so that is just not going to work. The girl at the desk was very unapologetic and made it sound like it was my fault. They were 100% booked; which I understand; but she offered no real sorry or anything.  I just walked out feeling pretty stupid; although they should be the ones feeling stupid.   Will start taking my business elsewhere. [REVIEW_11] Came here on a Saturday afternoon for brunch with some friends. Let me just say; my experience was AMAZING. So; where should I begin?.... OH.. Let's start with the Tiramisu french toast. Now; I'm not one to order from the sweeter side of breakfast; but these were basically screaming at me from the menu. These little slices of heaven came out fast (which I always appreciate) and were DELICIOUS. My other friend ordered the CANNOLI PANCAKES. UNREAL - no surprise there. Aside from the incredible food; the staff is extremely friendly and attentive. The overall vibe of this place was just so upbeat and really set a great tone for the rest of my day in Philly. Can't wait to go back! [REVIEW_12] Great choice in a small shop. Worth the drive. The wine cakes are excellent! Just went here for first time based on yelp reviews and will definitely be going back [REVIEW_13] Smoking allowed. There; I said it.  Good equipment; lots of room for players; and a nice area for spectators.  But they allow smoking.  EDIT: Lowering to 1 star after ""Peter F."" posted his ridiculous claim that spending $22;000 on an air filter makes any difference in protecting his customers from deadly carcinogens...he should do his homework: https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/air-purifier-smoke/faq-20058555 [REVIEW_14] Wow!  We had the most amazing food and service at Blue Fig!  The food is all freshly made.  We had the hummus and home made chips to start...highly recommend!!! They have a variety of gluten and dairy free options that are delicious. The falafel salad was the best.        Great to find a restaurant close by that's both healthy and affordable. [REVIEW_15] Staffed exclusively by apathetic; dull-witted employees committed to helping you as little as is humanly possible. First one I asked for help wasn't even aware the business had closed 15 minutes before; which would have saved me some time; the second replied to a question about whether there were any other open car washes close by with ""Do you know how to work GPS on your phone?"" Absolute waste of time. [REVIEW_16] This sushi restaurant was horrible.  First; when we walked in we were POINTED to our table; not actually walked to it.  No one smiled at us; and we were completely ignored throughout our stay.  We had 3 different people serving us; so we had no idea who our waitress was.  No one explained to us that the only option at ZEN was all you can eat; so when we ordered only 4 small items and received a bill for $56.00; we were astonished.  The waitresses simply ""dumped"" the food to our table....No smiles; no asking who the food was for.  I had to get up from our table to ask for our bill; as we were completely ignored and sat there forever waiting for someone to serve us.  I ended up complaining to one of the waitresses who laughed throughout the few minutes I complained.  DO NOT go to this restaurant....Overall a HORRIBLE experience!!! [REVIEW_17] Had a business dinner here and was not disappointed. Prime location at the end of Rocky Point with amazing views of the bay from the dinner table. Atmosphere is dark and inviting and food was really great. Had the conch chowder and it was almost as good as the conch chowder I had recently in Nassau. Dinner was the pasta primavera with shrimp and get ready to eat for an army with the portion size. Nice selection of wine; I went with a really smooth glass of Sonoma Sauv Blanc. We did feel a bit underdressed in the environment but the bar with sports on television gave the white table clothes a nice relaxed balance. I will definitely eat here again and recommend to people I know. [REVIEW_18] BEST PRALINES IN TOWN.   They are generous with samples; so go in there and try all the flavors (original; rum; chocolate; coconut; etc.).   BRING ME SOME WHEN YOU GO! SERIOUSLY! [REVIEW_19] The food ranks 3 stars but the service ranks only 1/2 star; dragging the over-all star rating down to a sub-zero number.   I walked up to the counter; was looked at (though not acknowledged) and; after a span of time what seemed eternal; asked by a gal standing far back from the counter; ""Do you need something?""   ""Food!"" I answered. Yep. Food.   She continued on with what she was doing: the grueling task of flipping tortillas on a grill. I full expected the woman's head to twist a complete 360 degrees; a trick I once saw in the movie ""The Exorcist"". If I had been wearing a cross around my neck I think she no doubt would have begun to manifest; as her eyes were by this time rolling in their sockets and back into her head.  I promise not to bother you again.... [REVIEW_20] This place is a scam. They serve drinks where you do not taste the alcohol. The bartenders complain about the tip you leave. I've never been to a bar that is so disrespectful to customers. I will never go there again bunch of young kids with no class. Place will be closed in 6 months. [REVIEW_21] I don't understand the hubbub about burritos that are 75% rice. No wonder they call themselves ""healthy"". I wish someone would open a Baja Fresh in Tucson. Much better. [REVIEW_22] So seen all the great reviews about this place figured it was as good as it seemed so went there food was great service was great but while waiting for dessert we seen a mouse scurry out of the kitchen then ran around under a couple tables in the dining room then made it back to the kitchen and our waitress seen it and was very embarrassed she acknowledge it and we paid and left don't think I'll be going back!! [REVIEW_23] Stumbled upon this place while walking around Philly. Way cool toy store!! They had unique and interesting toys- stuff you can't find at a Toys R Us. We went in there as adults and even found a couple new games. Definitely worth stopping in. They even put a cute joke outside; just ask an employee for the punch line. Very cute! [REVIEW_24] Here visiting and looking for a good breakfast place! This place is so cute it's hidden so not so easy to find unless you know but once you do you'll be happy you found it! They have all organic foods and Turkish coffee which was cool to try and was good. I also got the sunset smoothie which was very good and the silver dollar pancakes with eggs. Everything was good and service was good! Would def recommend! [REVIEW_25] Great service and body work looked great.  They even vacuumed the inside.  Randy kept me up to date on the status through text so I knew what was going on with my car at all times. [REVIEW_26] Not sure how this is classified as deep dish. The sauce tastes canned and lacks any of that fresh tomato taste. It has such a dark hue and strange flavor and the seasonings are just completely overdone. The crust is just bland. No amount of cheese can help this shame of a pizza attempt. [REVIEW_27] Why did it just take over 5 minutes for me to get only a medium coffee?  Because there wasn't any coffee made in a coffee establishment; that's why. In addition; there are non-customers sitting in all of the outdoor seats and the floors and counters are sticky. I'm done with this Cosi. I'll be going to Brew Ha Ha from now on. The customer service is just too poor here. [REVIEW_28] Usually I love 4 rivers; the location in west Tampa.  Today was just horrible.   I was overcharged for my meal; with no explanation to set it right.  I had the burnt ends sandwich- which was nothing but fat.  Couldn't even finish my meal. For 17.63 which is what I was charged for a sandwich with two sides) at LUNCH; I expect a bit more.  Will not be back to this location. [REVIEW_29] I went to see Dr. Taylor because a friend recommended him.  He did appear knowledgeable in many areas but did not listen to or honor the reasons for my visit.  Being a naturopath; he is familiar with both natural and allopathic methods of treatment.  Although his staff said he was familiar with the neurological issues I was asking about; he did little to discuss them with me.  He also did not ask if I wanted a more natural or allopathic approach.  He sent me out the door with an allopathic prescription for something he could have easily addressed with a natural approach.  When I called to cancel my follow up appointment; his staff was curt and dismissive and attempted to make me feel badly about cancelling.  He is not someone I would seek out if I was looking for a kind; respectful medical practitioner. [REVIEW_30] I started going to Keri a few months ago and I love the experience every time I go in! I get a cut and highlights and it usually takes around two hours. Keri is always very pleasant and engaging (even though I go every 6 weeks or so; I am always amazed that she can remember our conversation in detail from the last time I was in!). It means a lot to go to a place and be treated like a regular when so many places barely remember your name despite going again and again. The other staff are always very friendly and make sure you're comfortable (take your coat; offer you something to drink; and even go out and pay your meter if it's about to run out!). And of course I love what Keri does with my hair every time I'm there! They are truly a high class salon and give the experience you'd come to expect from paying a premium price. Definitely worth it for the experience and level of talent!",12
80,"[REVIEW_1] I've eaten here numerous times and every time it's been absolutely fantastic. Great food; nice people; calm and quiet place. Their crepes are the best crepes I have ever had. Amazingly delicious. I recommend this place to my friends all the time. I've always heard great things from them as well. [REVIEW_2] Very affordable clothing and they're ALWAYS running sales. Very affordable; yet trendy; and has excellent customer service. The other stores in the same area are very pricey; so if you're are looking to ""dress up"" ;) on a budget; this is the place for you. [REVIEW_3] Cake Bake is a must-visit if you are in Indy! Not only is the cake amazing; but the entire experience of your lunch/tea date/after-school treat is one of a kind. Every single detail is perfection. From the edible glitter on the cakes; brownies and cookies to the ornate silverware and platters to the French champagne; to the pink receipt paper; you will be in pretty pink princess heaven! It is over the top in the best kind of way. So fun for a girls date; bridal shower or a mommy and me outing. Today we celebrated with Red Velvet and 'Millionaire' cake and the sparkling (literally with floating glitter!) lemon lavender champagne as my sister found her dream wedding dress at a local bridal shop. Such a fun time! [REVIEW_4] Ian and Mike are amazing.  They did our entire house which included cleaning four bedrooms with carpet as well as two bathrooms and our kitchen.  The carpet turned out not only clean but incredibly soft due to the process with which they use no chemicals in the cleaning.  Our grout in the bathrooms and the kitchen was almost not recognizable.  They were incredibly efficient with their time and their service and professionalism was appreciated.  I will use them again and would recommend them (and have) to everyone.  Thanks guys! [REVIEW_5] Cool spot in a great location. We got there early; so didn't have the same crushing crowds others have talked about. The bartenders are awesome. Made me a Perfect Rye Manhattan on the rocks; never had one before...I'm hooked. Easily the best burger I've ever had! Will absolutely be back [REVIEW_6] It simply does not get any better than Tako for sushi. Everything is fresh & delicious. The private rooms are so fun for a festive night out; it's BYO & when my girls get together we enjoy the feast & atmosphere! Some personal favorites are the jalapeño yellowtail(a must!!); kani salad; bird's nest roll & the naruto (served in cucumber instead of rice. Honestly; you can't go wrong when ordering. And so reasonable!! I rarely spend over $35 including tip when we go; and we do not hold back at all when ordering. Highly; highly recommend Tako! [REVIEW_7] Went there for my birthday this summer because I'm a huge Sunny fan.  I ordered Hummus so that I didn't get drunk too fast.  It was so good; I got some to go at 2am.  If you don't get the Hummus at Mac's then I just feel bad for you.  It's so good it's almost criminal.  Trust me; I'm chubby.  I know food  :P [REVIEW_8] Great staff. They really know their menu well. Pricing was very fair. My girlfriend and I enjoyed everything we ordered! Will return! [REVIEW_9] I LOVE Katies.   This is a neighborhood locals place with a serious chef and a great menu.  I've been there at least 6 times.    Definitely have the grilled oysters.   The veal with a marsala cream sauce over pasta is one of my faves.  You can create your own pasta ingredients and there have to be 15 or 20 choices.   The po boys are great too.   The same goes for the pizza.  I'm from Chicago and I'm a snob on pizza.  This is the best pizza in NOLA.  The ingredients are super fresh in everything that they make.  It's a great sauce; quality cheese; etc.   They were the only place where I had a pizza that was perfect.   I had sausage; shrimp; and red peppers on my pizzas.   Pizza in the south generally has a doughy crust.  In Chicago; the only pizza you'll get like that is a $5 pizza pizza or pizza hut.    Katie's was the only place where I got a great pizza with a crispy thin crust.   It was the only pizza that stood up to my faves at home.   If it's nice; sit at the 10 or so tables outside.  After a few visits; they welcomed me and my dog as family.   Say hi to Murphy; he took great care of me. [REVIEW_10] Great company!!!  I called and they were able to come out same day to change 4 locks at our house.  They were professional; fast and very accomodating.  I had an issue with one of the lock alignments and they immediately sanded it down and fixed it. Overall great experience and highly recommend! [REVIEW_11] A restaurant worth visiting! This place offers exceptional service and a delicious menu! The staff are class acts and the venue is beautiful. Well done and thank you for making my dining experience such a great one! [REVIEW_12] Best tacos in SB!  Front counter guy always pleasant and friendly too. Love this place. [REVIEW_13] This place is a gem.Attractive space; great location near Broad Street line; plenty on street parking. BYOB. I've been twice and enjoyed every dish. Highlights were the chaats; beef short ribs; lamb vindaloo; beet salad; breads/pickles; and chai. We got the chocolate cake for the table to share each time and everyone loved it. Can get takeout beer at the corner bar. We'll be back. [REVIEW_14] Cheap. Large portions. The flavor is OMG! The bar just sets it off. I will be a regular here! [REVIEW_15] This place makes great cakes. Most of them seem to be layer cakes in various flavor combinations (though they do have other pastries). All the cakes I've tried have been very good. I'm less a fan of the ones that rely on buttercream frosting - they look very pretty; but it's just not my favorite style of frosting. Too dense; I guess. However; for my birthday; I had their Boston Cream (Creme?) cake; which was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend also got me a custom cake that's more European in style. They did an amazing job; and it says a lot that they were willing to try something new (I don't believe they'd made it before). The shop itself is very cute - definitely ""new Fishtown"" but still manages to be charming. The staff has always been friendly and willing to describe their goodies. A tad on the expensive side - there are certainly cheaper dessert options; but this is a good way to spend money every once in a while. [REVIEW_16] I'll admit I messed up and tried to rent a car from another enterprise location and they didn't have a compact car ready for but they gave me an SUV for a discounted rate with no hesitation. Then a few days later when I found out my car would take a week to be done I called to get a compact car due to money issues and they told me to keep the SUV for the compact car rate! Can't beat that! This enterprise location is so nice; quick; and accommodating. When I'm in need of a rental it's the only place I'll go! [REVIEW_17] Rude staff that stands around and does nothing besides stand in a circle and talk to each other. Doesn't bother to greet you when you walk in the door. Facility is old and not well cared for. [REVIEW_18] I love this place. I've started coming here once a week when my craving for bún gets too strong to resist. The staff is sweet; attentive; but also leaves you alone and allows you to really enjoy the food without having to constantly reassure them that; ""Everything's fine; food's great!"" Which is good when you're constantly chowing down on a mouthful of vermicelli noodles.  I am not an expert on Vietnamese food in the slightest; so I don't know about the authenticity of the cuisine; all I know is it's good; fast; and a healthier option for lunch or dinner on Magazine. [REVIEW_19] This is my kind of joint!  Cozy; great atmosphere; and the staff have been nothing but excellent to me. I love their mini pizzas. One of my servers even made me an off menu dirty vodka martini and prepared the cheese stuffed olives for me fresh...wow! Kale chips rocked also; loved the tangy yogurt dip. They have a live piano player some nights; totally classy and he was quite talented. Lilly's is the kind of place St Louis City deserves. Check them out. [REVIEW_20] This place is just awful. Great atmosphere; but food is just plain bad. I've given it too many tries. Done. [REVIEW_21] Great little restaurant to enjoy some typical Puerto Rican food. Service was great; Jessica was very welcoming and friendly. Prices are great and the platters will keep you full for a while. My family of four was satisfied. Will definitely go again. I would recommend it to anyone looking to eat delicious Puerto Rican food. [REVIEW_22] I had a Groupon for a Shellac manicure; Pedicure and Paraffin hand treatment. I didn't have too much of a problem getting an appointment over the phone though Brenda was very short with me.  Once I got there for my appointment with Brenda (which had been scheduled about 2 weeks in advanced) she was overbooked and asked me to come back later. I was unable to so she told me to come the next day. The next day I came back and was able to redeem my Groupon. It was a nice little shop but I did not see any sterilization of the nail tools. she carried them around in a coffee mug and there was nail dust everywhere;  She made personal calls during my pedicure and was very condescending when she spoke to me about my nails.  She also uses Bath and Body works lotion witch isn't a big deal but then she sprayed my legs with the body spray witch I thought was very strange and did not smell the greatest.  My shellac bubbled and didn't look the greatest and my nails were uneven. I also never got my Paraffin hand treatment because one of her ""usual"" customers came in and she was too busy talking to her to finish mine and I was very rushed at the very end.  She spent more time talking to others in the shop and on the phone than with me and was very condescending when she did speak to me. I will not be going there again and I will not be recommending this establishment to any of my peers. [REVIEW_23] Eggplant Grinder and Greek salad are off the chain! The pizza is excellent! [REVIEW_24] We decided to go were the locals eat. We went on a Saturday morning at 8am. Good thing new Orleans doesn't seem to wake up until after 10 on weekends. There was no wait. The food was so good!!!  I highly recommend the cinnamon bun freaking blew my taste buds up!!! The Nutella banana cream was delicious as well. [REVIEW_25] Their bobba is amazing! All of the food I've tried is exquisite and reasonably priced; I would definitely recommend eating here and trying some of their food. [REVIEW_26] Say you decide that you need a new door...and you only have $35.  Where do you go?  the Green Project.   Or you have a bunch of left over building supplies; random bits of lumber; some roofing materials; maybe even some paint?  Where can you bring it so it doesn't end up in a landfill?  Again; the Green Project. [REVIEW_27] What a wonderful find here in Newtown Pa. an authentic Indian restaurant with a charming cozy atmosphere and food to die for! We found it tucked in a little business center across from the Dunkin Donuts in Newtown PA. It is brand new and has taken over the same spot as Mamita's Latino had. It is worth seeking it out if you want to try real deal quality Indian food. We were seated by a friendly gentleman and fresh papadam (which is a crispy wafer-like cracker/tortilla) and chutneys were brought to the table immediately.  The appetizers we had were Potato Samosas with a delicious tamarind chutney and a biting fresh cilantro chutney. Very crispy and filled with savory potatoes and peas in a crispy wrap. Both were excellent.   We also had chili paneer; which really could be an entree. It was as hot as I wanted it to be but still you can tell a deft hand; who knows spices; created this dish (yummy beyond words!) and a we tried an interesting Panipuri. It was  a twist on the typical one you see on the Sunday buffets. This one was filled with crunchy toasted confetti and creamy avocado. Light and refreshing! Perhaps; you can tell my family loves appetizers and it would have been plenty of food if we stopped there but since it was so good we couldn't help but try as many things as our chubby tummies would hold.  Northern Indian food has always been my favorite style of Indian food but it can be heavy. It seems some restaurants think the more cream and butter the better but Guru's knows how to balance richness without killing all the flavors of the dish. So; being the hungry hungry hippos we are; here are our entrees: Palak Aloo- which is spicy; smooth spinach and potatoes; Chili chicken- an Indo Chinese dish that was seasoned to mouth watering perfection ;Kind of like a General Tso's on steroids and spice. It is one of our favorites. Paneer Makhni- a homemade Indian cheese cube kind of  like a tasty tofu but better.in creamy tomato curried sauce .It's rich and creamy but not drowning in fat like so many other restaurants. The breads are fresh made to order. We found out this place is a BYOB so that certainly is a plus for our next visit. We had mango lassi and;chai tea this time but an Indian beer would be awesome with this meal.    We finally surrendered after we tried the kheer which is Indian rice pudding .(Forget about the gloopy baby food the diners sell this is Awesome) .We can't wait to try the buffet that will be starting Thursday September 3rd 2015. [REVIEW_28] Service was awesome; food was delicious! Very busy place for brunch on weekends but the wait was well worth it [REVIEW_29] We had a great time at the pool a few weeks ago.  Dylan; the young man working at the pool; was very attentive to us. He got us towels and searched for 2 empty spots for us! [REVIEW_30] Carne Seca burro was smokey; delicious and really filling. The price is great for what they give you. If only they automatically put some tomatoes and lettuce. :( Other than that; you have to stop by and try the carne seca burro; especially if you're just visiting the area. The tortilla is amazing - if I wasn't in the process of moving; I would have taken a few back home to eat. Don't forget to order an horchada - they serve one that is delicious!",27
81,"[REVIEW_1] My initial excitement soon soured.  THERE WAS A HUGE ROACH IN MY FOOD!  How does one even handle that situation?  I just left because I was embarrassed for them. PATHETIC. [REVIEW_2] I had one of the top three worst restaurant experiences of my life here. One example is that my wife got a lukewarm burrito and sent it back after talking with the manager. The burrito came back partly eaten....by the chef....as the manager said she has the chef taste things when complained about....AND SHE BROUGHT THIS BURRITO BACK TO OUR TABLE...THE MANAGER  (who said she is part of the founding family). This is after waiting more than 90 minutes for our food. On top of that; the food is mediocre at best. Now I've read El Charro is selling burritos at 7-Eleven stores in California....enough said. Do yourself a favor and go to Poco and Mom's or even Guadalajara Grill. El Charro is WAY past its expiration date and those running it now no longer know how to serve excellent; or even decent; Mexican food. [REVIEW_3] On Friday November 30; 2012 after driving 7 hours from California I checked into Motel 6 at 960 S Freeway; Tuscon; AZ... I was given incorrect information about the internet service that was provided; the pillowcases were inside out so I called reception to let them know; they gave me another code for the internet and said they would let housekeeping know about the pillow cases. There was also an ashtray in a supposedly non smoking room which let her (Tiffany) know also)... My 7 year old son and I both fell asleep around 8pm. At 10.20 there was loud knocking on our door which woke me up. It was a 'security guard' who was insisting that I need to open the door and speak with her. I pulled back the curtains and she couild clearly see that I was in my pj's and I informed her that we were sleeping and I would not open the door unless she could give me a valid reason which she did not. I called up the front desk and spoke with Tiffany who said that it was fine she would let the security guard know that she was not needed. I then got back into bed... 2 minutes later the security guard CALLS ME; starts telling me that if I have any further small complaints they will boot me out of the hotel. She was extremely rude and behaving in a threatening manner. I called the police who came about half an hour later. The police office came to my room after going to reception first despite that fact that it was I who called THEM as I felt threatened. And she informed me that they were asking me to leave the premises. By this time it was after 11pm. My 7yo son was fast asleep; I had to wake him up; go and get a refund for TWO of the three nights I had paid for as they refused to issue me one for tonight and find another Hotel. I am ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED at being treated in such a manner. I have stayed in HUNDREDS of Motels and have NEVER been treated so badly. I asked the Hotel Manager to make sure the CCTV footage was saved so that when I go to a lawyer about this we will have all of those conversations on tape! That security guard should be ASHAMED of herself for treating people so badly. Had she come to my door and asked if everything was okay; I would have responded yes it was (we WERE sleeping) and she could have gone on her way. [REVIEW_4] I'm the second extremely low review but it seems the other does not show up on Yelp because it isn't ""recommended"".  We rated low for the same reason; which I think is notable. The visits I had here with Dr Burli and her staff were maddening to say the least.   I was told I did not have an infection that I only found out I DID have by calling 5 days later; 3 times in only 2 weeks I was told I would get calls back that were never returned. Dr Burli started lecturing me for medications that my primary doctor gave me she felt I should not use which I never asked for that advice(diet; as if my gynecologist was suited to speak to that).  I wish she would have focused better on the gynecological diagnosis I was there for and not distracted herself with my diet!   One female resident medical student was fine but the other male had wrinkly clothes and looked like he hadn't shaved in a week or so before he assisted while I was being examined (gross).    She tried to explain to me my symptoms were the result of a condition that could not be treated and that I needed to live with it. I insisted we do more tests because her explanation stated that the cause started nearly a year after the symptoms (which made no sense at all). She tried to talk me out of an exam because I ""could be subjecting myself to a procedure I didn't need."" Isn't that true of ALL tests? The answer can always be negative but at least you know. Turns out I did need the test she didn't want me to take. Three days after the exam I only got by insisting her nurse told me she wanted to do surgery.   At the very least I would expect an attending physician to teach students how to be friendly but she was completely unaware of how to deliver this service herself; let alone teach it. Cold; curt; inaccurate; late; unreliable communication and unfriendly. I can't think of a positive thing to stay about her or her staff or the students except one student was cleanly dressed. [REVIEW_5] Guy at the counter was rude; the place was filthy; and all around horrible! Would/will not recommend this place at all! [REVIEW_6] I had not visited Perlis in over thirty years and I now remember why.   My mother used to bring me there when I was growing up. My relatives shopped there too ; it was THE place that all of the old well to do familys of New Orleans went.       As a child ; I never noticed the rudeness ; I guess because it was my mom who had to work with the attendants while I sat board.   At twenty three ; I had not yet purchased my own suits ; and was still wearing the ones my mother had bought for me in my early years.    As a Twenty two year old I was a little intimidated as I walked in and saw the well dressed ; sofisticated attendants . I remember receiving glares and a very rude ; sarcastic  "" may I help you  "" from what appeared to be the man in charge at the time.   The rest of the visit didn't get any better. The attendant had a rude arrogance about him ; as though he was doing me a favor even speaking to me .  He obviously did not remember me from the last ten years of business that my mother had given them ; or maybe he did and just didn't care .  I suppose that having established themselves as THE place to buy clothing ; they had developed an attitude of superiority ; but to what ; or who ? These guys sell clothes for gods sake ; who are they superior to ?      This attitude has NOT changed.     A month ago ; I decided to see if a quarter century had brought about anything positive in the way of attitude.  My treatment was no different from that of my visit in 1982.  One of my attendants ( the head guy that day)  ; had the same arrogance as I remembered from years past.  His desire was to put me in what HE thought was best and displayed a sneer at my taste ; ( wich is quite conservative in nature and right up their alley ).     I ended up getting three pairs of pants ; one of which needed to be left for tailoring. I was told that I would be called when they were ready.     Four weeks had gone by with no call ; so I called them.  The mans tone on the end of the line was one of a person insulted . It seems that I was the one in error for having waited that long before calling ; and my tardiness was the insult.  How dare I suggest that Perlis would not have the work done in a week!!!    "" We always do "" ; he said.  "" May I ask who your attendant was  "" ?   ""  I don't remember "" I replied .            Then  ; with a VERY sarcastic  "" we'll do you remember the color  ; sir "" ?  ; with the sarcastic emphasis on sir.    "" I really don't ; it was a moth ago  ; and I bought them purely on a whim "" ; I replied .     "" Well wait just a minute SIR and I'll go look"" .      It was then that ; wether by mistake or on purpose ;  I heard him say as the phone left his ear for the counter  ; "" STUPID IDIOT "" !!                It was 30 minutes later that went through the door of Perlis for the last time.   There to greet me with same snied. ; "" may I help you sir "" ;  was the man I had spoken with on the phone. In my minds eye ;  I was expecting to see someone like those who I had seen the month before ; someone about 45 ; dressed to the old New Orleans nines ; but to my surprise it was a much older fellow ; short in stature ; and wearing a suit that I can only describe as strangely old fashioned ; like something the duke of Windsor might have worn in 1968.  It's funny ; I remember a picture from my childhood of a chimpanzee in a plaid suit very similar to the one he was wearing.  The picture was a spoof of a used car salesman if I recall.      While handing me the trousers he said ; in his now standard ; and rather lyrical sarcastic tone ; "" come again SIR ""  .   Not wanting confrontation ; I muttered ; "" not likely "" as I left their store for good.       I really don't know where these guys get off acting this way!?  Is business so good that they can treat customers with such disrespect and still gain new customers over the years?  That just doesn't add up.  I am sure I can't be alone in my experience. I wonder how many hundreds of thousands of dollars thes strangely arrogant people have lost over the decades by insulting customers this way?      Old man Perlis had better take heed of the fact that anyone can get anything in his store over the internet ; and for less. [REVIEW_7] It's been 10 years since I've been to a Shoney's; and I'll never eat at a Shoney's again. The people working there are nice and I honestly feel for them. The food was disappointing; though not inedible. The $11.99 buffet is a poor excuse for a buffet; we might have done better to just order something from the menu. I went with my wife and two kids on a Saturday evening and although they didn't appear to be that busy; it took 15 minutes to get a table and another 20 minutes to pay at the counter once we were done eating.   I don't really enjoy eating at Waffle House; but I would have had a much better experience at the Waffle House across Briley  I'm sure. [REVIEW_8] Wasn't impressed by the crazy long lines and only 1 person working; took absolutely forever and was definitely not worth it. The food was terrible and so was the coffee. Definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. [REVIEW_9] Well against my better judgement I went back to Freedom Smoke... I was in a bind and needed a tank so I called them first to find out if they had what I was after.   Brandon answered the phone and I explained that I wanted a Pro Tank because I had broken the threads off the base. He said he had some in stock; I then asked what the wait was like. He said they were pretty slow so I pressed on and asked if he thought I could get my tank and some juice in about fifteen minutes; he said more like ten. I was less than a mile away and when I pulled in it was more like 20 minutes just to get my order placed and another ten for my juice to come out. OMG!!! The only good thing to come out of this was they had the tank. The wait was ridiculous and to top it off the Starblast e juice was AWFUL!!!!  Will I finally learn??? [REVIEW_10] This place is overrated. 4.5 stars on yelp should say something about this place. Went here for dinner with some friends and everything tastes average. The best thing  on the menu is the ca phe sua da; but really; you can get great coffee at any other place. Not to mention the atmosphere and environment. It's too small and tight thats its very uncomfortable to enjoy dinner. [REVIEW_11] The food was terrible! the sushi had no flavor. Beef was soo dry.  Potato salad was nothing close to a salad. Food was not good at all. [REVIEW_12] Service was horrible; most food wasn't very good; spaghetti squash marinara was inedible. It took over an hour and the place was less than half full. As crappy as these awful chains can get. [REVIEW_13] Do Not Come to this Place! The shrimp was disgusting you can even taste the dirt inside it.  It took the 20 min to serve it. And took them another 20 min for the gumbo. Most horrible is no service at all! None! I sit in the bar for 10 min no one serves me! Even after I ask the bar tender many times he took my order with a shitty face; I got no water no Fock knife no nothing the guy next to me even yelled at them to get service. I asked the woman from the kitchen sending gumbo for water she said as kinda surprised and said"" you want water?"" Oh yeah should I is she dumb?   The bar tender was busy counting money and cold as as ice; the other guy grilling oyster is ridiculous as well. And oh boy the food is way over priced for the poor quality.  And the bar tender dare to have the face asking for 20% tip.  To the manager you should first fire the bar tender and then fire the chef; probably in the end fire yourself for hiring such horrible people! [REVIEW_14] Easily the worst gel manicure I've ever had. I called to make an appointment; and Sue did my nails. She rushed throughout my appointment; she was rough on my nails while filing them; and the whole process was incredibly uncomfortable. Each nail ended up a different length; even after I asked her to even them out; and then she began the polish. I ended up with red nail polish all over the edges of my skin and she couldn't be bothered to clean it up. She passed me onto someone else after my nails were done curing and I got the most pathetic little hand massage ever and was sent on my way. The whole process took about 20 minutes; but here I am on day 4 after getting my nails done; and most of them have chipped with two lifting completely.   I called today to see if I could come in to have them repair my nails and was told they would have to decide if they'd fix it or not. My gel manicures normally last between 2-3 weeks easily; so 4 days is completely unacceptable.   What a waste of money. I'll never go back. [REVIEW_15] I try my hardest to only eat at local restaurants; but have to say that after last night's service for me and the people sitting at the communal table with me...I will never spend my hard earned money at this local establishment again. The disrespect and poor sevice from the kitchen and manager on duty was shocking.  I would appreciate communication from the owner of this restaurant.  You really need to understand how your visitors are being treated. [REVIEW_16] Ate at Desire two times; once 2 years ago and 2 weeks ago. Both experiences were picture perfect. The service is impecable and the food followed in suit. Dont let the fact that its dead smack on Bourbon Street put you off.......Desire is a Jewel....Guaranteed.   Note: Remember that if youre trying to keep dinner on a budget at Desire; dont order any alchohol......itll run up the tab in a hurry :) [REVIEW_17] Came here for breakfast for the first time a year ago.  Went here again last week.  Still very good!   Food is delicious; and the coffee (capuccinos; lattes; etc.) are outstanding.  Not too hot; not too bitter; and the milk is incorporated into the coffee just right.   Will definitely come back the next time we visit Santa Barbara. [REVIEW_18] Horrible place to live. Horrible customer service. They powerwashed the roof and slug came thru our A/C and stained the carpet and they have yet to come clean it up after a month. Zero lights at night so have fun walking up the stairs with your groceries. There are so many choices in this area for apts; KEEP LOOKING ELSE WHERE!!!! Even if there is a good price; they will increase the rent after one year by 20-40 percent; so if you like moving and packing up all your furniture n clothes; then move right in. If you're looking for a place to live where rent wont increase and force you to move out; then PASS ON CAMDEN BAY!!! Id recommend checking out Westchase area apts. Its a much nicer area; with all the amenities you need. [REVIEW_19] Eyebrow tech burned my eyelids using extra hot wax. Then said oh it's that red in everyone. Really? Beware [REVIEW_20] I have taken my small pomimo here 4 times and before I hadn't had any complaints. I had set up an appointment on Thursday which I had walked to and the power was out but they still told me to keep my dog there. 30 mins after being home I get a call saying they can't do it and that we need to reschedule. I rescheduled for Saturday morning; two hours they call me tell me to come get him. I paid 60$ and his haircut is literally a hack job; i could of done something similar with my boyfriends trimmers! I called to inform them and they were not picking up my call.. What a waste of my Christmas money! [REVIEW_21] I would give them ZERO stars if it was possible. Bought my voucher through Groupon for the Drunk History Walking Tour. We scheduled an entire weekend in Philly around the tour. We do not live in Philadelphia; and we have a one year old son. My husband works the graveyard shift. Scheduling an entire weekend away is no easy task. We were so excited for this. Well; they cancelled our tour 24 hours before hand. 24 hours. Plus there were no other options for rescheduling that weekend. Not only that - their customer service is AWFUL. It is literally impossible to get anyone on the phone. We were told in the email when they cancelled the tour that it was from ""lack of interest."" Well when I was finally able to talk to a customer service rep through chat - before I even told her what tour had been cancelled she said; ""It was due to a tour guide emergency."" They can't even get their excuses straight! Luckily Groupon was nice enough to offer a refund in the form of Groupon Bucks (and they have wonderful customer service). But Best Tours is a joke. If you book a tour; don't bet on the fact that it will actually happen. Or god forbid plan a weekend getaway around it. [REVIEW_22] Okay I JUST got here and am extremely unimpressed. As I type this I'm sitting in the lobby waiting for our room to be cleaned because it wasn't ready for check in time. Our check in time was 3 o'clock (which is already late as it is); and when we got to our room; the place was AN ABSOLUTE MESS. The bedsheets and pillows were thrown on the floor; there were beach towels (not belonging to the hotel) lying around; and KFC food on the table. It was as if someone had just left.  Aside from that; the people at the front desk could really care less. When we went up to go talk to them; they didn't even apologize. All they said was to wait HALF AN HOUR for the room to be cleaned. AND they offered us another room... A smaller one. For the same ridiculously priced rate.  Primarily upset with the lack of hospitality; not so much for the clean room. People make mistakes; which is understandable. But the way they handled the situation was terrible and I'm definitely not coming back here.  **update it's been over thirty minutes and I'm still waiting for a room. [REVIEW_23] This place moved locations and when I placed a call in order the guy on the phone didn't even tell me or give me a heads up! I called to find out the new location and he gave me wrong directions! I was super bummed! No thanks! There is a ton of great Thai places in town with better service! [REVIEW_24] If you value your eyes (and your sanity!) please do not get an eye exam here.  First; the equipment they have appears to be from the 80s (florescent eye drops and all!). I don't trust it (or the doctor) at all.    Second; this doctor's interest is mainly in selling you things you don't need or want.  She tried to get me to buys some expensive eye drops so my eyes would not be dry (I never said my eyes were dry!).  Then; she tried to get me to change my contact lens brand; even though I told her I had been very happy with my current brand for years. She even wrote my main prescription for her brand of choice and added a side note (that you could barely read) of the different prescription if I want to order my brand.  Obviously she has some incentive to push her brand.   Finally; my prescription was actually wrong. She changed things in my prescription (not just the power) that had stayed the same for many many years. And did not explain why.  And all this is after I waited 30 minutes after my appointment time. I wish I had left.  I will be paying out of pocket to get another eye exam elsewhere before I order any contact lenses.  I hate writing such a negative review; but this doctor should really be avoided. [REVIEW_25] I have tried nearly every Hilton chain hotel in the Nashville downtown area and am running out of options.  I travel extensively; spending at least 200 nights per year in hotels; with most of those being the Hilton chain.  I've come to expect a certain level of service.  The Garden Inn at Vanderbilt consistently fails to live up to even minimum expectations as have other Hilton chain hotels in the downtown area (Homewood and Doubletree).  Inept and often condescending front desk staff; awful wireless; bland surroundings and generally bad service.  My team and I will be trying a new hotel brand! [REVIEW_26] All I needed was a written estimate.  A rather simple task one would think.  I needed my factory navigation unit in my Denali replaced; and needed to know costs and in writing.  Now this is a normal standard procedure for an auto repair shop.  Let's just assume its bad (it is); so tell me how much it is to remove bad part; and put the new one in.  Jay Fatimo or something like that; said he was very busy; as were the other service writers; so he handed me his card; and said to just email him with what I needed.  Sounded like a good plan; I wasn't in a big rush.  So I did just that; sent a picture of my vin; and the appropriate RPO codes to know what part I needed; and emailed it all to him.  I never got a response.  I tried again about a week or so later; still nothing.  Made sure it is his email at the dealership; etc.    I guess I have a hard time with taking my car in or trusting a place to do such repairs (3000 dollar job according to Winkel GMC) if they can't even respond to an email.  He knew I would email that day; and I did.    I guess the GMC dealer right next door gets my money instead. [REVIEW_27] Twice I have wanted to order through the Internet and twice it has not worked. The first time I never even got my order. The second time I called and was told; "" oh yeah that happens"". And then; if you want to order it will be well over an hour for a pizza. WTF? This is pathetic. I really want to support locally owned businesses but not like this. I will gladly walk to Theo's and get a pizza before I try these guys again. Too bad; you're ruining local;business. I will NEVER EVER ORDER AGAIN. [REVIEW_28] It has been a long time since we ate here. But we were getting tired of the same-old; same-old and the husband suggested we try it again. What a mistake. The place looks old and tired. NO atmosphere. But the service was prompt and friendly. We ordered our meals.... fish and chips for me and an open-faced roast beef sandwich for my husband. My dish arrived with three healthy  pieces of scrod in a very eggy looking breading. Fake fries (you know; reconstituted potato parts shaped like fries) and a very mayonnaise - y tartar sauce. The fish was edible. The fries were not. But the real surprise was the horrendous meal my husband was served. Instead of beautiful roast beef; he received fatty; chewy brisket; shiny gravy and those awful excuses for fries. We should have been suspicious when they offered neither a baked potato nor mashed potatoes. Nevertheless; he dug in. He hated the dish and ate very little of it. The waitress questioned him about it and he said he didn't like it.   She came back to tell us that the meat came from the end of the roast (thus the overcooked texture and heavy fat content). Even as we paid the bill; the owner apologized for serving such a lousy cut of beef. Then why serve it???? It makes no sense. In the meantime; my fish was just passable. Not inedible... but not very good.   They did reduce the bill and gave us a $5 off coupon. But too little too late. If you hurry; you will find the coupon in the entrance to the restaurant.   We won't be back; so you are welcome to use it. Though I wouldn't recommend that you do. [REVIEW_29] One of the best place to eat in the city and region. The service is great; the food is sooooo good and the decor is wonderful. I have been here a few times but this time they had live music witch added to the experience.  A Place you must go to. On the trendy Girard Ave. [REVIEW_30] We wanted to check this place out after seeing the great reviews.  Arrived on Thursday (New Years Day) around noon and the place was packed with a hour and a half wait. We put our name in and went next door for a drink;  The restaurant texted us when our table was ready and also had a cool app that you can check your place in line.  Only had drinks and a few apps. The tuscan fries were good but had a LOT of garlic. My friend loved her Kale salad.  If you like a bloody mary; try the cucumber mary made with cucumber vodka. It was unbelievable.   This was hands down out favorite place in Nashville and this place had the BEST service we got our whole trip. A+ to the staff. We were really really impressed.  We went back on Friday night around 1am and it was pretty empty. The guy sitting next to us said its really a better brunch or Sunday Funday bar and not busy at night.",4
82,"[REVIEW_1] Cashier was very rude fat Hispanic girl at the airport location. Very very rude. Half the menu wasn't even available. [REVIEW_2] My husband and I went here right before they were closing because we were in the neighborhood and needed some items for a recipe we were planning to make the next day.  I was super disappointed in this food outlet.  The meat section looked AWFUL; most of the meat was turning brown and the whole back of the store smelled like rotten food.  Like I said; it was around closing time; but it totally turned me off and gave me a ""gut feeling"" that I shouldn't buy anything from this store.  The layout was also a bit unorganized.  I will not be back. [REVIEW_3] Tried this place due to the high rating on Yelp.  This is one of the few times where I completely disagree with the general Yelp ratings.  I ordered some carne asada; shrimp; birria tacos; and a sprite.  My sprite came with a floating ant.  Ok; whatever; just asked for a new one.  Went to the restroom to wash my hand before eating.  ONE of the WORST bathrooms I've been in.  It smelled like it hadn't been cleaned in days.  Overall just dirty.  Got the tacos.  The shrimp taco was decent.  The birria was super dry and tough.  Lacking any flavor.  The carne asada was the worst.  Also dry; but tasted like old stale meat.  Gross!  Won't be coming back here again. [REVIEW_4] I really; truly hate giving bad reviews but I can't help it this time. Before I check a place out I refer to Yelp and boy did I get an eyeful when I read about the BROKEN BEAKER DISTILLERY. Vodka tasting like dirt? I wanted to give it a chance anyway. I never knew there was Dirt Flavored Vodka; but they sell it and it's expensive!! You can drink while the TV is turned down so you can't hear it; while there is no music on and while they ignore you and talk amongst themselves behind the bar. Rude!! The glasses/beakers that the drinks were served in were neat; but there was barely anything in there to drink at all; and for nearly $10!!! Don't get me started on the food and how when your ordering they make you think the side comes with it by asking; ""What's your side?"" only to be given your bill to see that sides are extra. The sandwich was just like one you could've made at home. Not even worth a description. I really hate it but 1 star is all I can give. I hope they make it big with Dirt Flavored Vodka. [REVIEW_5] I just started bringing my puppy; Chief to PBF. I've been seeing Dr. Barenbaum and I love her! She's spends time with us; answers all the questions we have; and She never makes us feel rushed.  Also; they are so reasonably priced! I did my homework before choosing a vet for my puppy and needed somewhere affordable.  I would absolutely recommend this vet practice! [REVIEW_6] I been to a lot of places but this place was gross. I am sorry to say but there was hair in my good and the waitress was rude. [REVIEW_7] This place is NASTY! . Floors; booths; sides of booths are caked with old food. Service was slow at best. Baked potato tasted like it had been baked 3 days ago. Will NEVER go there again. [REVIEW_8] Paid through Expedia and double charged by Wyndham. When I try to resolve with the hotel; I am sent to voicemail and calls are not returned. I had to call my credit card company to contest.   The bathroom was tiny and dirty. Hair from previous guest still on tub and shower. It took 20 minutes to get an elevator at one point.  People were taking the stairs from the 18th floor. [REVIEW_9] i dont know what has happened to the in store service in this place!  We have been down here for a few weeks now and have been here 6 times.Only once was the order completed without a screw up!  Today 2 tall decaf coffees took close to 20 minutes.By then our bagels were cold.First i was told the decaf was ""brewing' and then i was told there was something 'wrong"" with the brewer? After 15 minutes i was offered a decaf americano. Before we left i politely told a fellow behind the counter the service was abominable and he said 'well we can only store 2 vente size decafs at a time? HUH? I asked if the management knew about this and he just shrugged. Clearly this staff has never been trained to make it right for the customer.No apology.No coupon.Just a convoluted story.   Amazing how you can have numerous people running around a store but you cant get the simplest order straight My next visit to a Starbucks will certainly not be this one. [REVIEW_10] The food is not bad (Though for the price you can do far better in NOLA); but the waiter ruined our experience here.  I think his name was Stephen; but can't remember for sure.  My wife asked him if they had any non-alcoholic cocktails because she is pregnant; and he talked to her like she was an idiot; and acted very put off.  When she did not like the daiquiri because it was too sweet; he replied ""well; it's a daiquiri"".   Then; trying still to be nice; even though he was raising his nose at my wife; I said ""Do you have anything like a martini for pregnant women?"" And he said; ""I mean; we have juice...""  I'm alright with the fact that Mr. B's hasn't jumped on the wave of hip restaurants that  understand that when you are pregnant; you'd still like to have unique cocktail option (who the hell is still serving daiquiris?); but the dude was just an ass about it.  It's not often I spend 250 dollars on a meal and get insulted.       He was generally short and put off by us the entire night (every 15 minutes when he would happen to come over to our table... we had reservations at 5:30; he didn't take our order until 6:45).    Anyway; I hear there is good brunch at Mr. B's; but I don't think we will be going back.  There are too many great restaurants (We went to Coquette for dinner the next night; and it was amazing; and the service was excellent)  in New Orleans; and this place is top level price for mediocre food. [REVIEW_11] 2 thumbs down. I Went there for my 1st ever  manicure. Another customer came in 20 minutes after I did; no appoint. either. She was there for gel manicure. 5 minutes later the girl sits us both down; then proceeds to start working on getting her set up with gel manicure. She was on her way back to me; and a lady comes in for an unscheduled eyebrow wax. She tells me it's going to be a few more minutes so she could wax her. So she was going to help 2 unscheduled women who came in after me. That's bad business. So I got up and left. They clearly don't need my business. [REVIEW_12] You know; all I did was stand in line to buy a suit for my little boy.  I realize the clothing is used and certainly don't expect it to be treated as a new buy.  All I needed was a hanger to hang the suit on so it wouldn't get wrinkled in the bag.  The older lady with glasses checking me out told me I could buy a hanger for the suit.  If I wasn't desperate; with a sick kid at home; whom I'm trying to nurse back to health for a piano recital tomorrow; I probably would have let this pass.  Saver's I hope a hanger was worth losing my future business.  I suggest you provide some kindness training for the rude and non-compassionate human you have working for you....Transaction 8797; register 7; operator 1515; 10:34a.  I'll go elsewhere next time where I can be treated with little kindness and respect. [REVIEW_13] I worked closely with Angie at Rincon Catering for my wedding at the Santa Barbara Zoo. They are the mandatory catering company which initially could feel like a compromise in going with the venue but they are actually awesome! I had a family friend who had heard great things and they definitely delivered. Angie was super helpful every step of the way. They did a large tasting event and it was a perfect way to choose appetizers and entrees as well as decor. We heard the food was some of the best most people had ever had at a wedding which is every bride's dream to hear:)  I would highly recommend them! [REVIEW_14] We caught an Uber here and they wouldn't admit us with my backpack; nor check the backpack; nor search it. We had to miss our movie and wasted $30 on Uber fare there and back. Shitty. [REVIEW_15] While they do have the hottest wings I've ever tried (i like everything hott hott hott); there's just too much grease for this stomach to handle..and just me..my stomach is made of iron.  My inlaws really enjoy the teri wings and eat it weekly.  Wish there was a way they could clear their arteries. [REVIEW_16] The worst service I've had at a restaurant in years. Went on a Sunday for lunch and our waitress took forever at every step in the process; and acted like she was doing us a favor at all times. Never smiled or treated us with basic human dignity. The final straw was when she finally brought our food; I was left to stare at it while it got cold for almost 10 minutes because she didn't bring any silverware. I had to ask three different waitstaff for silverware before I finally got it. And all of this for pretty mediocre; way overpriced food. Nashville has SO MANY good restaurants (particularly burger places) that there's no reason to eat here. [REVIEW_17] So far the most amazing court house I have ever seen. Great for weddings; though beware there are tours going on; and it's open to the public. Probably the most beautiful building in Santa Barbara. If you can go to the tower; you can see the ocean; and a beautiful town. Love Santa Barbara. [REVIEW_18] Terrible Service! I went there with a co worker around 5pm to get drinks using a giftcard I got from RiteAid.com. I've been there a couple times because their chicken fingers are delicious! When I got there; I told the bartender that I had 2 /$10 coupons(only because it didnt allow me to buy $20); she said I could only use one coupon per month. So I said 'okay well then we'll just be getting some drinks.'  She never said anyrhing else. So when we get the bill; the owner came over and told me to never come back!! All because we didnt order food and he thought I was scamming him!! (If she said we had to buy food then we would have) Then said shouted that doesn't support alcoholism! (But owns a bar) I can't believe because I had 3 beers after work on a Monday; I'm considered an alcoholic! The bill was about $18 and I was going to give a good tip but.... I'm never going back. Just like another review I saw for this place- ""These people judge a book by its cover."" If you don't want people to use the coupons!! don't offer to be on the website!!. It's simple. Such bad business! [REVIEW_19] Not very hungry for this meal which was too bad as everyone seemed to enjoy their burgers.  Definitely what you're looking for in a sports bar - loud; energetic; good food and lots of televisions but beat of all the customer service! Thank you Jelicia - sweet disposition and even amongst the crazy Saturday night college football chaos; she maintained a high level of professionalism; accuracy and dang; she was one of the nicest waitresses I've come across in a sports bar!  Thanks Jelicia! [REVIEW_20] This place has the worst customer service. My friend and I went to jack in the box at 12:30AM on a Wednesday night. We were the only ones there and I went to order my food and said okay so that's it for that order; we're gonna have a second order and he said we actually can't do two orders and I understand that during a rush or something but we were the only ones there. So I said that and said well we are literally the only people in the drive thru; like what difference does it make? And he was like you can come in the store and do two orders and I was wasn't going to do that so I told him I would drive around again even though it was completely unnecessary. So I got my food and went around again (still no cars had been through the drive thru) and ordered a single coke. Not even food which made it more annoying. But anyways. So we got to the window and wanted to get more fries because they gave me a super small amount in my meal but we weren't gonna complain because we were already over this experience. So we were just gonna buy them. And so we asked if we could add on fries and she said no!! She literally said ""uhmmmmmm no"". And I was speechless. Needless to say. Screw them. [REVIEW_21] I have been here a couple of times and they are always friendly and very helpful. The part I picked up today was A LOT cheaper then the dealership and they also installed it for me cheeper then any other place I called. [REVIEW_22] The best coffee in town. Makes it hard to go back to SB ever again. I'm a Frappe fan but also love the hots and have never been disappointed by the quality. They even know what we like and will have my husband's ready before he reaches the window! [REVIEW_23] Sarah is a great barista! She knees exactly what I meant when I said ""that's apple thing. The hot apple juice!"" (Caramel apple spice) This location is very clean; the staff is super friendly. My room mate who worked at Starbucks for several years says the same thing! [REVIEW_24] Tried this place out this morning due to the relatively cheap price and good reviews and I was VERY disappointed. I swear my spicy tuna roll was warm and nobody wants room temperature raw fish! The mussels were dried out and tiny and 90% of the rolls on the menu have cream cheese so there's not much variety. I had two rolls and just left rather than continue eating there and will not be returning when there are so many other good sushi options in Reno.  I will saw however that the staff was very friendly; and I don't think it was the staffs fault as much as it as the obviously low quality ingredients. [REVIEW_25] We were looking forward to trying out this newly redone restaurant. The atmosphere is fresh and well done . We were there for breakfast. They now have table service. Things were great until the food came out. My pancakes tasted like stale bread.  My wife's eggs were cold. The potatoes were not cooked. They brought the wrong side dishes. For silverware; we were given  forks but no knives. It took a while to find a waiter to get the silverware we needed. We did speak to the manager. She offered a discount of $2.50  not that we were looking one; but why bother?). However; she did not remove the extra charge for the incorrect side dish we didn't order ($4.00).  She did apologize for the food verbally but somehow we were made to feel like she couldn't care less. I don't write many reviews unless I really love something or dislike something. This restaurant fits into the latter category. Sorry. A nice decor is not enough. [REVIEW_26] We had a great 3 course meal.  Or at least it took that long.  50 minutes to be seated even with tables open.  Another hour and a half to complete the meal.  Food was adequate by then they argued about their coupons.  Thumbs down.  Won't be back again.  I wish I could give this zero stars but then it wouldn't count as a review. [REVIEW_27] Salad was good.  Pizza is not good!  Boring; tasteless and just unsatisfying.  Very disappointed.  Also on a chilly night it is a cold interior.  This was my third try there.  Won't go back [REVIEW_28] I had my condo tented a few weeks ago. We came home 2 days later to find dog poop was shoved in the cracks of the floor rocks in the back yard. The whole back yard smelled horrible!!  We collect our dog poop for a week and put it in a bucket until trash day; we also add a little dirt to the bucket to keep the smell down. We forgot to through it out before the tenting and left the full bucket in the yard.   I called Jhonny's and asked for someone to come out and explain why they did this and clean it up. Two days later someone came over to look at it. They didn't bother cleaning it up and they lied; saying they got dirt from the ground and not the bucket. I told Jhonny's employee it was to much of a coincidence that the bucket of poop was entirely empty and the area where they had to add dirt smelled of poop. The employee continued to lie about where he got the dirt from; but agreed to have someone come by the following Monday and/or someone from there office would call me to set up an appt.  As of today no one called; no one showed up. [REVIEW_29] This place has gone downhill in a hurry.  When it first opened; the donuts were actually good and had creative toppings.  Now they have creative topping but the actual donuts don't taste fresh.  They have opened up a few locations and now the quality at the original location isn't there. [REVIEW_30] You will not find a more authentic place as this. From the decor to the food to the wait staff Mercedes parked out back. This is 100% Greek and authentic. Food is fantastic from the pita bread and hummus to the authentic Greek cuisine. While it may have touristy feel there are plenty of locals and Greek people eating here. I enjoyed every min of our experience here. There were so many choices on the menu that it was tough to choose. I had the combination along with a Greek salad. Delicious.  You won't be disappointed.",8
83,"[REVIEW_1] We stayed at The Saint last year for a girl's trip. The lobby is lovely; they have a cool bar and restaurant that you can't help but to ""ohh and ahh"" over when you walk in.  All the things I'm accustomed too when I stay at a hotel anywhere...ambiance; a little sexy but not overkill! Everyone is so friendly; etc.  I'm thinking ""oh shhhh this is going to be a great weekend!""  I checked in a few hours before my girl arrived because I had a ton of work i needed to do. So I set up my laptop ordered some room service and worked for about 4 hours straight. Left out to buy a bottle and get a mani/pedi.  My girl arrives...its about to be some trouble in NOLA... the two of us and no supervision...we pop out for dinner; come back in giggling as usual and we see it...a HUGH flying roach.  I'm freaked out.  I literally walk right out of the room down to the front desk.  I CANNOT!!!! They tell me they're sending a maintenance worker to handle it.  NOT GOOD ENOUGH! If there's one that's bold enough to show itself; he has other cohorts that prefer to live behind the scenes. They give us another room but tell me they can't do more until 8am.  No the room the move us too also has small spiders and other dead small bugs in the corners of the window. The TV doesn't work and one of the lamps doesn't have bulbs in it! COME ON!  At this point its about 3am and I know I'm not staying here past 8:15am. I dont want to sit my purse let alone my luggage in this hotel! I go online to my normal go to hotel; The W and book us there for the rest of the trip! 8am comes and goes no manager comes to our room. I go down and demand to see someone immediately.  This younger gentlemen comes out and apologizes.  I thank him for his apology and politely request ALL of my money back immediately.   He obliged and asked if  I would consider coming back after changes have been made! Bless his heart. NO dear! [REVIEW_2] Horrible food.  Bread sticks totally dry. Mozzarella sticks more salty than salt itself. And the worst tasting; bland; fettuccine alfredo ever.  Gave it a try despite the 1.5 stars but shouldn't have risked it. Wish I could give them a zero. [REVIEW_3] Original backribs taste like they were cooked several days ago reheated and came out of a vending machine!Most disappointing for a place that should be known for excellence in Backribs! [REVIEW_4] I seen this ad and thought what a cute name; i called for appointment and to verify if they accepted my insurance; the girl was not able to answer; so i figure I'd  go anyway; i was treated very nice and was advised they can give me a free consultation but in fact it was not free they get you into the room and than tell you they must charge.. so where the free consultation; i got up and walked out. Never going back [REVIEW_5] I was there when it was a wine and pizza bar and came back one more time as a taqueria...nope! Overpriced; no atmosphere; usually dead; menu is all carbs and the rum and coke was the worst I have ever had. Rock music was playing in the restaurant..nothing authentic about it. Ma Gerks across the parking lot steals the show. I suggest playing mexican music; testing your kegs to ensure freshness; have a wider selection of liquors; build an atmosphere and hire mexican cooks.  Whoever moves into this location next will have to be a hell of a sell being that there has been little success. [REVIEW_6] Terrible. Overrun with pretentious yuppies; babies and dogs. No point in standing in line for small portions that are overpriced. I left and had dinner elsewhere. Good idea; terrible execution. [REVIEW_7] No military discount for my son headed to Kuwait to serve our county! Shame on you all! All other places were happy to give the standard discount. Unacceptable! [REVIEW_8] I paid well over what I was wanting to and what they told me. and they had me bring my car in 3 times to get the problem fixed. then guess what? I got my car back and it's still doing the EXACT same thing!! no problem fixed and paid for extra shit that didn't make my car better. if anything my car is worse now. [REVIEW_9] The buttermilk chicken and the donut they give you with it were both disgusting. Couldn't even finish it. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Idk. [REVIEW_10] House of Beauty is an absolute sham; and possibly a scam!  I ordered products from them some years ago; and waited a ridiculously long time to receive them.  I decided to try them again recently; ordered my products online more than 6 weeks ago; and have received NOTHING!  No one ever answers their phone; and I have written several emails with no response whatsoever.  DO NOT order anything from these people; they are terrible!  Angela [REVIEW_11] the drinks suckkkkkkk!!!!! worst service ever!!!!!! make sure you bring cash. paying with a card; they add a extra charge just for that! never again!!!!!!!!!! [REVIEW_12] MY review is based on the sales department. The service department is AMAZING and are not relevant to this score. Also; Richard (aka Michael) at Ray Brandt was AMAZING. Great guy and made my test-driving experience one of the best! Unfortunate that the lease deal (that was not in his control) was nowhere close to honest or accurate.   BACKSTORY: Returning a VW Jetta lease just days before my lease is up. Went to Ray Brandt first (and did not just deal with one person; I dealt with 3+ not including Richard) because I initially leased from them and ended up running for the door. Called Southpoint VW immediately after and I have no words for how awesome they were. I'm just going to explain the difference between Southpoint VW and Ray Brandt VW:  RAY BRANDT: I am not in this ""90 day period"" to return my car so they will have to do me a PERSONAL favor and take the hit of my return fee and minor scratches (that added up to $1;300 btw). Meaning it was no longer an incentive for me to return my car; it was a personal favor I should be thankful for.  THEN on my quote print out.. there re-appears the $1;300! They snuck it back in my price thinking I would not notice and tried to cover up with some story about taking it out of my ""discount"" (but I followed what they were saying; and it indeed was a deception)  SOUTPOINT: No such thing as ""90 day period"".. I was leasing another VW; therefore they did not even care to inspect my car. I hand it in as is (assuming I had my 4 doors and bumper of course!).  --------- RAY BRANDT: I wanted the black Tiguan and I had to pay $200 transportation cost to get it from another dealer  SOUTHPOINT: No only did they pick up the black Tiguan from another dealer 100 miles away; they drove it all the way from Baton Rouge to my WORK! NO CHARGE! --------- RAY BRANDT: Expected I pay 70% of the MSRP in 36 months. WHAT?!?! and they had no explanation (except for jargon) when I asked three times for the break down and how that makes sense to THEM.   SOUTHPOINT: Paying 35% MSRP in 36 Months. BEFORE negotiation -------  RAY BRANDT: Any and all incentives (that I knew about beforehand) were now personal favors. Told me the price break-down print out was something they ""don't show people""!  Ok; only every other dealership I visited before showed me the print out WITHOUT that fancy line. I give my social; birthday; salary; credit history; and address... I think I more than deserve to know the details of my future car!   SOUTHPOINT: Gave max incentives; honored all deals online; adjusted discount to make whatever I put down still in ratio with other deals for down-payment promos that I wasnt participating in; wrote off $$ on contract based on negotiated prices we had talked about. Gave me all information and price details upfront.  ---------  RAY BRANDT: Jacked the MSRP price $1;200 more than market price claiming when the car comes from Germany it's a bit lower but once it gets to dealership they add things such as ""felt trunk separator"" and the ""first aid kit"" that factors the price higher. AGAIN... WHAT?!! hah!  SOUTHPOINT: MSRP was $4;000 lower than RAY BRANDT  (SAME EXACT CAR). Mind you- it's not actually ""lower"".. this IS the price of the car.  -------  RAY BRANDT: $467/month $1;000 down for basic factory standard Tiguan S 2016 (please look up so you can laugh that I could lease an AUDI for that much).   SOUTHPOINT: $256/month $0 down. SAME TIGUAN S 2016!!  -------  RAY BRANDT: Only saw me as easy $$$ and an ignorant consumer  SOUTHPOINT:  Respected me AND my wallet. They did EVERYTHING to make my experience as convenient as possible; honestly and ethically.   --------  Even if Ray Brandt dealership gave me a deal I couldn't resist; I still wouldn't be able to sign the contract because I don't trust them. [REVIEW_13] I was on the guest list tonight as my friend from high school was DJing; however; when I got to the front of the line I was unfortunately shoved through the front door before I could show my ID and verify my guest list status. After I was shoved through I tried to explain to the bouncer what had happened so I could properly verify that I was actually on the list. This bouncer then accused me of just trying to sneak in for free without paying even though I went back to him once I was inside. He then proceeded to belittle me and completely disregard the fact that I was allowed to be there. This ended in me being denied total entry; despite the fact that I was on the list; and I will never come here due to how I was treated by this bouncer. [REVIEW_14] Went here after being told by the owner that they had a taco sale. We were seconds from going I the restaurant next door because of their taco sale; but this guy was rather convincing that his place ""Rotten Ralph's"" had great tacos for sale.  Soon we realized that it was his sad attempt at getting someone to come and eat in his horrible eatery.  The staff were borderline brain dead and had no knowledge of their drinks. One of us ordered a blue moon and it seemed to taste like a colt 45.  I could tell you how horrible the food was and how old the salad must have been. I could tell you how the burger must have been a previously microwaved patty. Or I could tell you about the guacamole that came with the salad. The white guacamole. But I dot think I need to talk about how horrible the food was because it's called Rotten Ralph's....  We should have seen that coming.  I think this place could be good because of the location. It's near a lot of great places.It would make a great toilet.  Oh! And they didn't even have tacos on the menu!  Burn it [REVIEW_15] Got yelled at to close the door...as I was walking in....I guess they didn't want my business. [REVIEW_16] Asked for a trim and thinning out; got butchered instead! The ladies were rude to start I should've walked out but I didn't now we will suffer 6 months while this mullet grows out! [REVIEW_17] Myself and a family member went into Table Talk to purchase a new living room table about a month ago; the table was one from reclaimed Indian Teak; and we were very excited about the table! After speaking to the owners; managers; and a few employees they loved the idea of the table. We got a great deal; paid the down; and waited the 4 weeks to hear back from them saying that our order was in and ready to be delivered.  Then the phone rang. It was the owner (I cannot remember his name; he was an older gentlemen); and told us that they couldnt get the base of the table; and wouldnt be able to put the table together. He said that they could still sell us the top of the table; but there would be no discount. We were rather confused about the request; and politely declined to purchase the table from them at that point. Back to the drawing board!  So; we did some research and found the table from their vendor through a friend who purchases wholesale furniture. The cost was the same that they charged us from the wholesale vendor; that Table Talk wanted to charge us! Now; that doesnt make much economic sense to us.   In conclusion; we found it odd that they would 1. Lie to us; saying that they couldnt get the table; when they just mischarged us; 2. Attempted to scam us out of the difference in cash instead of just taking the loss on their business; and 3. That they would so disregard the common good practices of business.   If you are looking for unique furniture; there are so many better places that have ethics and integrity. Avoid Table Talk at all costs! [REVIEW_18] ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!!! I've been sitting in their drive thru a total of 20 minutes. Why have I never learned my lesson about this DD.. I do not know. But after today I will never be back again. People have to go to work... don't have time to be sitting in a drive thru for 15/20 mins [REVIEW_19] I visited Just Cookies to get some chocolate chip cookies for a friend and I before a concert at the (awesome) Murat.  Specialty bakeries are the best; unfortunately; this place was the worst.  For cookies at this price; they should be better than the discount day-old cookies at the supermarket..  much better; even!  But these were; somehow; worse.  Not just dry; but bland.  I couldn't believe that a bakery specializing on just one item could do them so poorly.  And while the woman was not explicitly rude; she certainly wasn't friendly either (not even a smile.)  To Just Cookies; I'll Just say No! [REVIEW_20] We were VERY disappointed with West Side Gravy.  My fried chicken was two small legs and a thigh; all undercooked;  served in a paper cone; with very small sides of tasteless potato salad and so-so coleslaw.  My iced tea tasted sour.  My wife had the lobster roll which was quite small and tasted mediocre at best.  My son had a hamburger and fries which was fine.  The service was adequate; but nothing special.  Not worth the $50+ (plus tip).  We will not return . The big reason for our disappointment is the fact that The Blackbird Restaurant (attached) is run by the same chef; share the same kitchen and the Blackbird is terrific. [REVIEW_21] Hmmm let's just say avoid this cheesecake factory! Upon arrival they said it was going to 40 minutes for our table. That's perfectly fine it is a rainy night and I expected it to be a little wait. We walked around the mall and did a little shopping before they texted us to let me know our table was ready. When we came to check in the hostess informed us that our table was given away to a larger party but they were working on getting our table together now. Strike one! Don't text me to tell me my table's ready and then give my table away when I check in. I asked to speak to the manager and he also informed me that they made a decision to pull the table that were going to sit at to get the table ready for a party; but they would have a booth cleaned off soon.... That should have been my clue that it was going to be a sucky experience when the manager cosigns with a silly mistake.  They finally got our table pulled together for us and we had a very friendly server from what it seemed. We ordered and waited and waited and waited. (Ok we will say it was because it is a busy night) Our food finally comes out and my Chicken Farfalle was supposed to have extra Farfalle sauce on the side. No Farfalle sauce. My friend ordered the steak Diane and shrimp scampi. Her steak Diane was supposed to be MW however it came out medium closer to medium rare. We informed our server that the steak was not cooked properly and I was still waiting on my Farfalle sauce. The server informed me that she ""just had not picked up the sauce yet and she would get it"". Strike 2. She brought me back my Farfalle sauce and let's just say it wasn't Farfalle more like Alfredo sauce. When I told the server it was Alfredo she took it sniffed the bowl and said ohhh let me fix that. She came back literally with the same bowl she sniffed and said ""this is the correct sauce the manager said it's the correct sauce"". I told her it was incorrect and I have eaten this many times. She proceeded to try and explain how it was the correct sauce. Strike 3! I am done. I know what this sauce taste like and that was not right.   I will not be back here and please whatever you do just go to the one in Green Hills! The Green Hills Cheesecake Factory service is always good and the food is always great. I've tried this one about 4 times and it always ends up the same. I'm angry at the service and the food is never good. I'm sitting here at the restaurant writing this review so that in itself should let you know the level of frustration I have tonight!!! [REVIEW_22] Food is terrible and too expensive for how bad it is. Took over 2 hours for delivery. Rude on the phone when we called to see about our order status. Terrible decision to order from this place; never again. [REVIEW_23] Changing original review below and moving to 1 star simply based on the fact that 4 out of 4 times we have had some of the slowest service making it not worth paying for. Went again a few weeks ago only because my mom wanted to go there for the lemon drop martini's. We sat down and waited 40+ mites to order our drinks; another 15 to receive them and that was just the start. Water served at table was warm; no ice and only refilled after multiple requests. Food came out not as ordered; tho was  very good as it always is... or maybe we were just that hungry after waiting so long.  Also learned our server was the assistant manager... if that's how much the assistant manager cares about customers and great service how is the rest of the place suppose to care?   I wrote in and spoke with the manager just to let him know. He was very professional and kind about it; even sent free drink coupons but even that has me questioning if I'll ever return... what goods a free drink if you have to wait almost an hour to drink it? Great bars on the other side of route 30 and they serve right away.   Bottom line - save your money and hit one of the other spots in Ardmore because there are some great ones!    Original Review: For suburban square; a decent spot. Enjoyed food and drinks; great lemon drop martinis. Ample parking in lot next door; close to train. Desserts very rich and filing. Servers not that great on 2 times being there. [REVIEW_24] The WORST electricity company on this continent.  PECO simply did not have my address in their system; so I was not able to pay or get my account information. I gave all the information I could to them. I even read the meter numbers to the customer service morons; but they still do not know what was going on. Now they are threatening me that they would turn off my service because I did not pay.   I think PECO's business motto is this: Solve all their problems with the I-WILL-SHUT-YOUR-SERVICE threat. [REVIEW_25] Braving the twisting road and hiking down to get there (NO parking.)we were met with a what i will call; THE REST STOP. If your idea of a ""Special Night"" out involves sitting in the dirt on tree stumps watching LA poseurs vaping after all-day wine binging sounds fun; this is your kinda place. Their walk-in hut offers beer only; no place inside to sit and relax. The outdoor BBQ sandwiches feed the crowd as they stare at the road to see who arrives next. The band was good; but were crammed into a corner of the dirt; near the beer hut with no dance floor.The only place of solace is the Tavern itself; and a charming respite from the outside. My ribs were tasty; but my husband's fish entre was a big disappointment. The servers were tense feeding the crowd on a holiday weekend. In short; I will never be back. The whole vibe just sucked. [REVIEW_26] If you're a Latino; you're best staying away from this place. The lady that cut my hair was rude and very unprofessional. [REVIEW_27] Absolutely disgusting. Do yourself a favor and never order from here. Food is terrible [REVIEW_28] although i live a stones throw away and love the concept; i can no longer support this establishment. the food is just too inconsistent and despite the reasonable prices; subpar quality. i guess its still better than Goldies but Sylvan Park deserves better. [REVIEW_29] We ordered a cake for my daughters 6th birthday. She wanted a princess cake and picked one from the book they gave us for examples. After picking one out we were told we would have to provide the decorations; such as the tiara.  While I hadnt heard of this; I returned a few days later with a couple items; tiara and wand; to put with our cake. I watched the girl put out items with our order. When I returned to pick up the cake; nothing was on it...NOTHING!  At first; thry tried ACCUSING me that I hadn't brought anything in. Luckily; the girl that took our items was working and remembered I had brought items in and she had no idea what they had done with them. Once I started describing items; they admitted they had thought they were extra and put them on another cake (which doesn't make sense because I watched them staple the bag to our order).  I demanded to speak with the owner and she wouldn't come out because she was too busy(I could hear her telling her staff member that) After 15 minutes of demanding to talk to her; she came out with the MOST RUDE attitude and acted like;""well; what do you want me to do about it. And said I could just run to the dollar store to get something else to replace it if I really NEEDED the cake that we ordered."" After telling her that I was on my way to the party and didn't have time to replace the items her and her staff gave to someone else; she returned from the back with a brush and mirror. A BRUSH. After saying I wouldn't have a brush on a cake she just stood there and was like well do you want this cake or not because she had other stuff she had to do. They knew we were in a bind and I paid for the ugly cake. ..with just writing ; just so I could get to the party on time.  Kim is by far the worse business owner I have ever dealt with. She is rude and acts like she doesn't need your business. I would never recommend this bakery to anyone and hope you choose another small business to give your money too. [REVIEW_30] This establishment is truly the worst. (And I'm not just saying this to fit in with the 50 other 1-star reviews.)  For starters; the owner is an absolute jerk off who has no problem getting wasted in the bar and kicking you out if you disagree with him. I've seen it happen at least twice. They should bite the bullet and place a sign over the door stating that differing opinions are not welcome.   I've also been privy to him taking advantage of drunk people and telling the bartender to add drinks to the tab that weren't ordered or that were ""on the house"" for other people.   Then there is the ""manager."" I can't count how many times I've seen him berate paying customers; get into loud; heated arguments; and throw people out.   And let's not forget the aforementioned bottled water debacle.   I'm not sure how or why this place stays open through Nashville's boom. I would come fairly regularly for a while to give it a chance but I eventuslly couldn't do it anymore.   I certainly hope this is not the impression of Tennesseans tourists leave with.",0
84,"[REVIEW_1] I used to come here a lot. However I will not be coming here very often in the future because the customer service seems to be lacking. My online order did not go through and this was very disappointing; they made me stand in line again and re-order my food and did not offer me any type of discount or compensation for this disservice. I asked to speak to the manager who also did not offer me any kind of compensation. They don't seem to care about customer satisfaction instead they were fine with the fact that my online order did not go through. So if you're reading this Panera please take into account that you should work to satisfy your customers. We order online because we have small kids [REVIEW_2] Went here for dinner; got the crab claws; gumbo and jambalaya pasta. Was really disappointed in everything. Everything came out like warm and not hot. The crab claws were the only thing that was good. The gumbo was not good at all. Our jambalaya came out and had a hair In it! We couldn't eat that and had to return it. The manager came out and all they did was apologize. That doesn't make up for me leaving still hungry.   Such a disappointing experience and won't be back here.   Next time take care of your customers and make sure that you do something besides offer an apology for ruining our dinner. [REVIEW_3] I have now been here 2 times; and both have been strictly out of necessity. The prices accurately reflect the overstaffed; up to date facility; while their service does not.   While every time that you have to take your car in anywhere; you cringe at what they are going to come and tell you; this place has been far and away the worst I've experienced. I do not trust them in the slightest. If you're looking for tires; they may be ok; but the mechanic services are horrendous. [REVIEW_4] The service was Ahmazing! The Meat burrito was delicious and served with great sauce!! The ambiance is real chill! I recommended this place to anyone visiting New Orleans or who lives in the city! [REVIEW_5] I am visiting from Chicago and stopped for dinner.  Food is VERY salty which any Thai cook will tell you is a big no no.  It is more Chinese style on stir fry's and they burned the fried rice.  Service very slow also. [REVIEW_6] I've been to New Orleans several times but this time I was looking for a different kind of dessert type of treat aside from the go-to beignets. So I found this spot on Yelp. They had 8-10 flavors to choose from so we got 4 of them. Praline bacon; raspberry white chocolate; pineapple upside down; and cookies and milk. Praline bacon was the 1st one we tried and it was a tough act to follow! It was a flavor party where sweet; savory and yummy had me dancing. The pineapple upside donut was good. The raspberry was my least favorite. However; the cookies and milk pulled up the rear and made the wait worth it. Overall; the donuts are great and whatever batter they use for the actual donut is really tasty. I will be back for some donuts AND sliders next time. [REVIEW_7] If you order the same type of meals they will make a meal for one and split the amount of meat with the 2nd platter. Yes they always short you out of your meat. Why the heck did we only have one strip of grilled chicken for each wrap. This is not the first time this happened either. Don't even bother to tip them because you will still be hungry and will have to eat again to satisfy your stomach.       When we all order separate meals or separate types of meals; we get the correct amount of meat and fries. Idiots [REVIEW_8] I will never eat there again. I ordered chicken Parmesan and after about four bites I realized my chicken was raw!  The manager Gary  said this hardly ever happens. What? Like it was a common occurrence. This place will never last. I ignored a good friends advice saying he had a bad meal there. Next time I will listen. [REVIEW_9] Things that make for a great date night: A beautiful date Reservations at a new dinner place Getting dressed up Finding a babysitter for the night Having good conversation   Things that kill any date night (and entire weekend): FOOD POISONING    My wife and I were so excited for our date night. I had made arrangements for someone to watch our daughter so we can have a fun evening as a couple. We love to try new places and after a little search; I found Taverna on groupon. The menu sounded wonderful and with it being in Broadripple; I thought this would be perfect opportunity to go to the Corner Wine Bar afterward.     This place is a little expensive and because of that; I though the atmosphere would would have been more intimate with cozy seating and dimmed lighting. Instead; an Applebees has a more romantic setting.   We were greeted with kindness; the service was really good; and the white sangria was fantastic which would have earned this place two stars but the way the lady handled my call; telling her my wife and I got food poisoning; made me take that other star away.    We ordered one pitcher of the sangria; calamari; we each had the 8oz filet mignon wrapped in bacon - my wife's portion was larger than mine with more sauce - and lastly tart for dessert. The calamari was really good; the meat was cooked to how we like it and and the meat by itself was really good. However my wife thought the blue cheese on her filet tasted funny and scrapped it off. We both love blue cheese too.   After our meals we got our dessert. It tasted awful and we could not finish it. However we were polite and didn't say anything. Now; if I was the server; I would have asked if anything was wrong with it because we only ate a couple bites and we didn't want the rest to take home. Oh well; the total damage was more than $100 but we had a groupon; taking a huge chunk of it away.   We sat at our table for a few more minutes after they cleared it and discussed going to our next location. Unfortunately; we didn't make it. Once we got into the car; we had to go home and it quickly went downhill.    I called the place on Saturday to tell them about our Friday night experience. The lady said that no one else had complained about their food; no one else got food poisoning and then acted like she didn't care. She didn't even say sorry.    Because this place has only been open for a little over a year and pricey; I would have expected someone to have handled this in a little nicer way. Having a child and dealing with food poisoning kills not only a date night; but an entire weekend.   On a positive note; I'm sure I lost a pound or two of my 'winter' weight - thanks Taverna. [REVIEW_10] Looking for a hard to find book January 9 for a one year wedding anniversary for my wife that I bought a KitchenAid mixer for. The special KitchenAid mixer cookbook showed in-store availability; yes I know how to search within a store to see if it's actually there. I pick the store; I checked the availability within that store. It said in stock limited quantities. I'm only a half hour from there but it was rush-hour traffic. I get there and looked everywhere for the book. And I do mean looked everywhere. I finally gave in to ask someone to search for this books location or these books; this guy behind the information desk said I'm looking in the warehouse not in the store... I showed him where it says this particular store in store in stock etc. complete with store number and address. He continued to argue with me that it just means warehouse; it just means it's in the warehouse; it's just in the warehouse;.! Seriously? If something says available in a particular store and in stock with a green check mark next to it that means for all you people out there don't waste your time trusting it-go to Barnes and Noble. I can't believe how stupid these people are by goading people to come into the store just to create more floor traffic! I will never frequent the store again and I will make sure this review makes it to every Internet site I can put it on. I was seriously pissed off at their lies! Yes I know it's only a book; But I sat and googled every possible bookstore all over the place and that was my closest possible store to pick it up especially during rush hour traffic. I must say these people are serious douche bags.! [REVIEW_11] We got there 30 plus minutes before the show expecting to enjoy a drink or two and some food before the show...were told a server would be right over to help us...no one ever came...so no drinks or food...seats were comfortable but no service took a lot out of the experience. [REVIEW_12] This was hands down the best tuna melt I have ever had. Very clean! This was also the best service I have ever had at a cafe. Awesome service and really on top of things. It's crazy because it is inside the grocery store! They should expand this cafe without the store attached!!! It would be amazing!! [REVIEW_13] We held our year end Holiday Party for our firm here this year.  The service is impeccable and the food is amazing.  The restaurant was closed to the public for our private event.   Tara was wonderful to work with as our party planner; working closely with us to customize our menu and provide our own entertainment.   The entire staff was very attentive and assisted us in setting up our little bar area (this is a BYOB).   We couldn't have been more pleased with the atmosphere; food and service.  We highly recommend the Silverspoon and can't wait to return again! [REVIEW_14] Ok well I'd heard so much about this place i had to try it. Well NEVER AGAIN! Dirty Dirty Dirty! Rude service. Chicken parm outrageous over priced. N never in life had chicken parm covered in black pepper. Would of sent back if waiter ever came back to table. Bread was so old n when asked for new i was questioned if i new what i was talking about. Well since i grew up in the food industry. I think i know. N from dirty table clothes. Too dirty glasses not once but 2x give up on clean one. If it wasn't for husband stopping me complaining right then u would of heard it all in person. I know restaurant have off nights. But this was beyond OFF. [REVIEW_15] First; I want to clarify that the service was great! Unfortunately the food sucked so hard that they only came out with the rare one-star rating.  I was really; really disappointed in the quality of food! It was basically inedible...the best thing was my daughter's French toast (which was still just average). My meal was hash browns covered in peppers & onions; salsa and cheese. The peppers & onions weren't fully cooked; the hash browns were like mush and it was smothered in plain old pace salsa from a jar. Sick. And so; so disappointing. Also incredibly over priced at $10 for a breakfast meal. We had 2 adult and 1 child meals; and used a free meal coupon and the bill still managed to be over $20?! When we go to Cracker Barrel around the corner the tab is $22 (no coupons or discounts) and we get way more food of much higher quality. Breakfasts will be at Cracker Barrel from now on! [REVIEW_16] This is the place we have been searching for! My friend and I have tried several nail salons in Tampa and nobody could do designs and stuff like how we wanted so we found this place on Instagram and we will never go anywhere else again! We drive almost an hour to get here but it is so worth it! I have had 2 different people who both did exactly what I wanted and are extremely talented! Thank you Pamela and Steven! You all do amazing work!!! [REVIEW_17] A few years ago I bit into my roasted peppers AND a fish hook. The staff could not have cared less; pretty much insinuating I brought the hook with me to put in their food. They didn't even take the dish off the check; even though I wouldn't eat it or anything else after nearly having my gums impaled. I'll never go back & have advised others to stay away. Not even an apology. I should say there was a lot of blood & they couldn't wait to get me out of there (after paying the full bill). Rude does not even begin to describe that staff. [REVIEW_18] Beware that this place charges $18 per day for parking and a ""resort fee"" of $15 for internet access; 2 bottles of water a day and on line access to a newspaper site. I reserved our room on line; and only found out about these fees when looking at the reviews on yelp when trying to find if any of the restaurants in the resort were worth trying. I called and spoke to a manager on duty about these fees and she refused to refund the fees since I checked the terms and conditions box on the reservations page. I informed the MOD that I had neglected to read all of the terms and conditions; therefore she refused to help. After returning home I looked at the terms and conditions on the reservations page; where the check box appears and indeed it does tell of the $15 resort fee; but fails to mention the $18 parking fee.   This room was $250 per night before taxes. The room was nothing special. I've stayed in La Quinta Inns and other places that were just as nice; if not better; for far less.   I also was left wondering what happened to the southern hospitality that us southerners are supposed to be so well known for.  When I pay $250 a night for a room; I don't expect to be charged exorbitant fees for things I get for free at far less expensive hotels. [REVIEW_19] What a fantastic and cozy place!  My friend and I ate here last night and we had such a wonderful time.  Our server was awesome and well prepared.  Not once did we feel rushed.  It's not too often you're in a restaurant and you feel like you could sit there the whole night drinking wine and eating.  This place and our server did exactly that.  From the starter; to the main entree to the dessert everything was to die for and the service was impeccable!    I started with the tomato soup while my friend started with the lamb meatballs.  The meatballs were AMAZING and the soup warmed me right up.  We both got the vegetable ragout and it was delicious.  I think every other mouthful came with a 'wow that's good' or 'there are so many flavors.'  I did appreciate how it wasn't too salty as well... or at least I couldn't tell it was.  And then dessert....apple bread pudding with brown butter ice cream.  I think that was the name of it anyway.  My friend and I almost came close to licking the plate!  We had wine by the glass and the pours are generous!!!   I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a restaurant so much!   I can't wait to return with my husband and I hope the service is just as good on a weekend night.  This restaurant is truly a gem! [REVIEW_20] Dreadful place. Nice products; but not worth the constant glaring and staring. The staff seem to believe that every shopper is going to suddenly run off with a rack full of clothes. I have never felt as uncomfortable in any other store. Creepy. [REVIEW_21] I wish I read these reviews before we hired Mayflower because we had a very awful experience with the company.  I do not normally write reviews that hurt companies but this experience warrants one.  My mother and father moved from St. Louis up to Chicago and my parents are older and therefore needed the help of movers.  I could not help them move because I was in middle of moving myself.  I wish I had moved at a different time because my parents could not have been in worse hands.  The caliber of employees/movers they sent to help my mom were horrible.  I will just list some key moments during the move.   -Telling my mother ""Don't you have a husband"" whenever she asked them to move something to another spot.... It was agreed upon and paid for that they would do this extra work.  My parents are older!  They are not able to move these things anymore.  -Lewd subject matters for conversation were audibly projected through the neighborhood and in front my parents.  -Argumentative when asked to move certain things to the basement.  Again; this was agreed upon to be done when Mayflower was hired.  -After getting upset about moving things to the basement; the movers proceeded to intentionally drop and slam items around the house.  Many items are now permanently damaged.   We called and complained about the movers behavior and the customer service representative told us that the mover who argued and slammed items would not be paid.  This does not really fix any problems.   I will make sure to tell people to hire anyone but Mayflower.  Thanks for making a emotional and difficult time just even more awful. [REVIEW_22] Took my bigger dog there for grooming.  She came home with cuts in her ear and uneven fur in the front.  Who knows what else was done wrong.  Be warned... if something happens; you won't be told.  Totally unacceptable!!  Our poor dog has been tramatized of groomers since.  Def don't recommend. [REVIEW_23] I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. Their biggest mistake is not having a customer service department. They rely on their sales team to provide customer service meaning every time you call in to try and get something done; you get put into a voicemail because the sales guy is out selling - which should be their only job. This left me on numerous occassions incredibly frustrated that I could not get an answer. I even left the manager a voicemail (big surprise I couldn't get them to answer) and they never had the decency to call me back - Just made my sales person call me back.  I purchased my car last July and was promised numerous things would be done to the car before I purchased it. One of which being the tint on the rear window would be removed as the view out of the back was blurry. Somehow; that passed thru inspection and when I came to sign the papers; I noticed that it was still on the back windshield. I was told that they would have it removed by the time we were done the paperwork. Also; I was told that the price was going to be higher than the original agreement because the sales manager did the math wrong the previous day when we ran numbers. I told him that wasn't my fault and I would only pay the agreed upon amount and he spoke with the manager and got it sorted out.   After sitting in the office for 2.5 hours; they finally told me that they were unable to even start taking off the tint and I would have to bring the car back. I dropped it off that Friday and let them keep it for the weekend. My sales guy called me on Saturday night to tell me that they never got to finish it and I would have to bring it back again and leave it. I live 45 minutes from the dealership so this isn't something I can easily do. I insisted on them giving me a loaner car for whatever day they would do this as I was sure this wouldn't be a one day process from my previous experience. 2.5 weeks later they were able to provide me with said car and I dropped off my vehicle. When I went to pick up my ""finished car"" there was still tint left on the bottom of the windshield.   After all of that I knew I would never bring my car back for service there if that's the kind of service they provide. Now with all the rain we've been having; my trunk is leaking and when I called to check with the service department to see if it would be covered under warranty; I got the same run around with the service department who just said ""I don't know"" - OK well give me someone who will be able to tell me. Once they forwarded me to the correct person; I again got ""I don't know"". We need you to bring it in and look at it then submit to our warranty company to see if it gets accepted. No thanks after my previous experience of bringing my car in there to get ""serviced"".   Invest in a customer service department to handle complaints in a professional and timely matter. This should not in any way be left upon the sales department to do. My sales guy did the best he could and I appreciated the help he gave me; but no one else would help me throughout the entire process. Not a good look on managements part. [REVIEW_24] I should have known it would be a bad experience from the beginning. The chips tasted stale and the salsa tasted like ketchup. Old el paso salsa from the jar would have been better. The guacamole lacked flavor; I suggest they add some cumin. The enchiladas tasted like they had Vodka sauce on them and the onions inside tasted like they weren't cooked. The tacos had cabbage on them.  The best part of the meal was the margarita. The strawberry margarita was really good.  The gentleman collecting the plates dropped a dirty knife on my cream colored shirt. I didn't say anything; we just got the check and left. We will not be returning. [REVIEW_25] Recently had a horrible experience here. Service- We were seated at a table to which none of the servers were apparently assigned. Everyone just kept walking by our table and ignored us. After 15 min; my husband flagged someone down.  Host came over; apologized and got our drinks.   Food- Definitely not worth the ridiculous prices.  My shrimp cocktail was so tough I couldn't chew it.  Scallops were ok but definitely not the best I ever had and not at all worth the price $32.  It was served with some watery cauliflower that they called ""puréed.""  My husbands $42 filet mignon was a piece of tasteless; stringy meat.  Host asked how our food was and he agreed that the meat looked stringy and explained that he appreciated the feedback because they are trying a new meat provider""!!  Offered to get something else but we declined. Just wanted to get out. We were offered free dessert.  Ambience- sounded like we were eating in the casino game area.  Noisy. Very bright lighting.  One of the ceiling recessed lights was shining directly on me like a spotlight. I actually brought it to our waiters attention and asked if they could be turned down.  He simply said no and walked away. Furnishings look so dated including the fake fish tank on the big ""gold"" wall!  Will not return. For those kind of prices there are soooo many better restaurants. [REVIEW_26] Put this review on south street on accident; but here is my review. I took my big puppy Vader to doggie styles on Pine St. He was a smelly mess; but when he was finished with his ""spa"" treatment he looked amazing!!! A big shout out to the grooming and staff. Erin did an amazing job and you could see her true love for animals. Lily was very helpful and set me up with an account. The store was so cute. I'll be coming back! [REVIEW_27] Define the worst Mediterranean food I have ever had.  The hummus appeared to have a good texture; that is the little bit I could see under the ocean of olive oil.  The pita bread was burned- not just over toasted; but black on the majority of the wedges.  I went home and was sick the rest of the evening from the amount of oil it had in it.   The manager was probably the worst of the experience. He told my gf he would ""upgrade her hummus for no charge; because normally it's $1.00"" but said it as if he was doing us this huge favor.  He then continued to yell at us from across the restaurant after we sat down  (instead of coming up to our table and actually having a conversation) and says; ""please let me know how your food is because that's the only way I can know if we are doing a good job or not is when customers tell me.""  But we agreed that the vibe he gave off would not be that of open mindedness and gratitude if we were to say anything about his plate of olive oil; er I mean hummus.  There is also a sign that advertises the ""cleanest bathroom in town"".... Ehhhh ok; good to know for our next road trip. [REVIEW_28] I would give them 6 stars if I could. We had a fantastic time at this restaurant. We used the Yelp ""Skip the Line"" option which out us ahead of a lot of other people who probably did a walk-in. We we're seated less than 15 minutes after our Yelp suggested arrival time. Our server Joe was the sweetest gentleman. We ordered Bloody Mary; Mimosa and a Bailey's Irish coffee for drinks. All amazing! The Bloody Mary basically came with an appetizer on top. Hah! We ordered the Breakfast Sandwich and Baked Breakfast Sandwich for our meals. The portions we're huge but so delicious! The hashbrowns we're better than the ones at WaHo and if you know me; you know my love for WaHo hashbrowns! The grits we're way better than Flying Biscuit's grits and that's saying something! Overall; amazing place for brunch and fantastic service! [REVIEW_29] I'm shocked to read that other people have had problems here; because this place has been nothing less than excellent every time I've been! Everything I've tried there I've really enjoyed. The cajun spiced catfish is by far my favorite! The wine list is good; though I've never tried anything else from the bar. The service is always attentive and even the chef comes to visit the table! Don't forget to get the apple lind betty for dessert; it's to die for! [REVIEW_30] I really wanted to be able to leave a good review; this place is within walking distance so the location is super convenient.  Basically; the food is mediocre; which is fine; I can handle so-so tasting food. It's the experience portion of dining here that caused such a low review. I saw the good and bad reviews; but I'm fair and like to judge from my own experience; so I came in with neutral expectations. I came in with a group of six people. We ordered separately; I was the first to order. However; our food took 25 minutes; and when we asked what the holdup was; no one seemed to know or care. We did end up letting them know the service was poor; and the guy I was explaining to walked away as I was speaking! He flat out did not care.  At this point; that's just plain rude. We tried to complain to the woman managing the floor and her response was; ""oh.""  Apparently; we weren't the only ones complaining; as we were walking out; another customer walked in to get her money back because her boyfriend has already been served and finished his food while she still hadn't gotten hers. This place has potential; but until they realize that service is an equally important part of the restaurant experience; they probably won't even try to improve. Such a bummer.",9
85,"[REVIEW_1] I came here once & never again! The girls working know nothing about the food & basically shove a menu in your hand! I wasn't impressed with the food myself; it was very bland & pricey for 1 meal. [REVIEW_2] One of my favorite breakfast places to eat love local food thank you for excellent customer service every time we go! [REVIEW_3] A 12 dollar burger and fries that were not even edible. Seriously; I used to enjoy this place but man has the quality taken a nose dive. [REVIEW_4] We'll I thought the place was going out of business. They basically had no cigar selection. [REVIEW_5] Wow. I am not a vegetarian; nor am I a health-food nut (except for my random ""diet"" binges) but this place is awesome. A co-worker talked me into trying it out one day (by going there and getting me something and putting it in front of me) and she created a monster. I may not order every day but I sure do think about them. And their delicious salads! Every time I go there I am greeted with a smile and there are tons of other people waiting for their food; as well. Good company =) [REVIEW_6] Coffee and tea done properly. First time here and i was not disapointed. Will be going back. [REVIEW_7] Took my bigger dog there for grooming.  She came home with cuts in her ear and uneven fur in the front.  Who knows what else was done wrong.  Be warned... if something happens; you won't be told.  Totally unacceptable!!  Our poor dog has been tramatized of groomers since.  Def don't recommend. [REVIEW_8] The Shop is an amazing space! Their attention to detail and services are unbelievable. Plenty of places to have private meetings as well as post up and get work done. [REVIEW_9] I went to the salon for a hair cut and Meghan was my stylist. She did an ABSOLUTELY amazing job and was full of personality. I got a wash; cut; and blow out all for $27 bucks because it was my first time! I also got a coupon to come back for 20% off anything I have done in the salon which I will be redeeming later this month. I am very excited to find a great salon that is near my house & doesn't cost a million dollars to get something done.   I have been here for the Benefit Brow Bar as well which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND; if you want your brows to look amazing - it is the best place you can go . I trust them with my life.   I really can't say anything negative about Ulta. I am surprised at the ""rude customer service"" complaint because I have only experienced the best here. (plus there is always a coupon so I really REALLY love this place).  OK bye! [REVIEW_10] My wife and I loved everything about this diner. The decor is lovely & the food was great. I had the cheese steak and it was much better than Geno's.  Our server was awesome [REVIEW_11] Absoulutely loved the ambience of this place! The food was beyond delicious and I was blown away by the dessert. Also; service was very good!! [REVIEW_12] Great place up on the mesa near lazy acres.  They have really good japanese food and give you a ton for the money.  I used to get takeout here a lot; but it's a good place to eat in as well.  I'm not a sushi guy; but I've been told that theirs is very good! [REVIEW_13] I ordered delivery; food was an hour ad a half late and cold when it arrived. I was told they would be sending a free drink and dessert due to the tardiness; but those items never arrived. When I called to inquire; they said they would remake my order - though since it had been two hours since I originally ordered; I was not surprised nor did I care when that never arrived either. Food; service and punctuality were all terrible. I recommend spending your money elsewhere - this was the worst dining experience I've ever endured. [REVIEW_14] Meet by a great hostess at the door; Jenna. Her smile was amazing! Drinks at the bar were rather good.  They actually have a loco moco! BOOM! [REVIEW_15] I went to El Camino on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. When I got there we had to wait for a table so me and my date grabbed drinks from the bar. We ordered a pitcher of margarita. The bartender came back to check on us and she couldn't hear me and flipped her head to the side and her hair landed in the pitcher. She said she was going to make another one. She pretended to throw out the liquid in the pitcher and make another one . Instead she walked over to the other bar and just added ice to the pitcher her hair landed in .That was strike one of the afternoon. Then when we were finally seated I ordered the pancho nachos with chicken. They brought it out without the chicken. I tell the waiter. Instead of bring out a fresh nacho they bring out the chicken in a bowl. Service is poor and the quality of goods is not great either. I used to like coming here but know I most likely won't be back again as the standards in customer service and quality of food and drinks has significantly decreased. [REVIEW_16] I've never had to write a review based on horrendous service/hospitality alone; but I've also never felt so humiliated as I did when I visited Wings Over Broadway for the first time the other night.  I was really looking forward to trying this place since people rave about how good the wings are and the great Tuesday night specials. I was coming from work so I arrived a few minutes after my party. The restaurant was half-empty when I arrived and there was no one waiting in line; so I went to my friends' table where their food had just arrived. That's when I was informed by the waitress that I couldn't sit down.  The manager came over and explained the policy of ""no add-ons"" to a table; and the waitress offered me one of the (many) empty tables; where I would be ""allowed"" to sit BY MYSELF; as if I was some kind of pariah. My friends were aghast and we explained that we'd never been to Wings before; and they would never have invited me if they'd known I wouldn't be allowed to join them.  I said I understood the policy for busy nights; and in the future we'd certainly abide by it; but since there was no one waiting for a table it couldn't hurt for me to sit down.  Then the owner came over and very rudely said; ""Fine; you can sit down. But you have to pay full price for wings; no special for you."" He and the manager were glaring at me; totally unsympathetic. I've never felt so insulted; and never before experienced this sort of treatment from a restaurant. It pretty much ruined my day.  To the owner of Wings: I was the nicely-dressed young lady that you turned away; and I'll be telling everyone I know how you made me feel and to avoid your establishment in the future. [REVIEW_17] Probably an amazing bar- I typically LOVE Margaritaville bars; but the security guard here was SO rude and SO disrespectful; even to those doing exactly what he asked. He put a huge damper on the day and the fun of the event. I'm so disappointed that the bar staff was so unreceptive to feedback from customers. [REVIEW_18] Not sure how this is classified as deep dish. The sauce tastes canned and lacks any of that fresh tomato taste. It has such a dark hue and strange flavor and the seasonings are just completely overdone. The crust is just bland. No amount of cheese can help this shame of a pizza attempt. [REVIEW_19] I pop in here for a manicure whenever I get a chance. They look good and last longer than many of mine do. The space is really light and airy; which is nice; and I love that they carry Smith & Cult polish.   I do wish they had another area for you to sit while you wait for your nails to dry; because I'm a huge klutz and pretty much always smudge them. Not a huge deal though!  ALSO; Raine is absolutely amazing if you need a wax--she's so fast (15 min) and really minimizes the ouch factor. [REVIEW_20] Nice stay hotel nicely decorated room OK nice comfortable bed after being out and about; paid $25 to park stated in/out but just used trolley to get around. Located about 4 blocks from Harrah's Casino and Bourbon Street. Breakfast was nice eggs oatmeal biscuits sausage patty; breakfast potatoes; waffles bagels ; evening reception 2 beverages and finger food salsa chips nachos meatballs celery/carrots and hot wings. Soda/coffee available all day  ;popcorn after 2 . Elevator had to be operated by room key and after hour entry plus pool. Pool gym and laundry room located on the 6th floor pool is nice size with jacuzzi . [REVIEW_21] I went to this store because they carried the phone that my daughter wanted.  I had researched the price and knew what i needed. The sales Associate; seemed professional; until he told me the price of my bill!  the numbers did not add up. I was shocked to say the least.  He was trying to sell me a shield for my phone; for 40.00- I did not ask for this.  I only wanted the phone and a case. I told him about my employer discount at least 5 times.  He gave me a ""new"" price; which seemed to be more in the ballpark of what I was looking to spend.  I asked for my receipt; and was not provided a detailed break down of what my charges were- first time ever! I was so angry that I had to leave the store. I called Verizon when I got home; they were able to direct me to my detailed receipt on line.  Turns out he charged me for insurance that I was not offered nor did I want and he did not give me my accessory discount! I am still so angry over how this sales associate tried to screw me and my daughter.  Buyer beware!!! ask for a detailed receipt.  do some homework before you go if you choose to use this store.  needless to say I will never go back there! [REVIEW_22] If you're looking for dentists who are detail oriented and friendly; precise dental is the right place to go to. The technicians were very skillful; and the dentist; Dr. Tanner; is very kind. He will discuss with you any concerns that you may have; and will make good referrals to other orthodontists or surgeons if needed. I think I found my new general dentist; Dr.Tanner is one of the best dentists that I have seen. [REVIEW_23] Had brunch on a Saturday. Food was delicious! Service was great! Great atmosphere! Will definitely put this place in my rotation of favorite spots! [REVIEW_24] Horrible place to live. Horrible customer service. They powerwashed the roof and slug came thru our A/C and stained the carpet and they have yet to come clean it up after a month. Zero lights at night so have fun walking up the stairs with your groceries. There are so many choices in this area for apts; KEEP LOOKING ELSE WHERE!!!! Even if there is a good price; they will increase the rent after one year by 20-40 percent; so if you like moving and packing up all your furniture n clothes; then move right in. If you're looking for a place to live where rent wont increase and force you to move out; then PASS ON CAMDEN BAY!!! Id recommend checking out Westchase area apts. Its a much nicer area; with all the amenities you need. [REVIEW_25] Rude employees. Suggested I was lying about trying to place an online order online with cash as an option. I could not use cash as the option as a ""guest"" and I did not want to create an account as I usually use much higher quality pizzerias when I am looking for a pie. I understand this is just a chain store but as a costumer you still expect to not be treated rudely. [REVIEW_26] This description is perfect: ""If you are looking for a venue for a group of your friends and you to hang out for a late night but not too late; come here. Mandarin is a 1am bar/club/lounge that has an Asian-fused ambiance with a great patio; a few reserved tables; 2 fully loaded bars; and dance floor space. Mandarin is kind of hidden from Maryland Ave. It is on the rooftop overlooking the fountain in the Central West End. With boasting rights of being located there for its fifth year now; Mandarin continues to grow strong and brings in a decent crowd every Friday and Saturday night."" The DJs spin video mixes which are pretty dope. The take the roof off every May; and have a lot of celebrity parties. It used to be accessed by elevator; but it wasn't reliable enough so now its stairs in and out; which sucks for the girls. [REVIEW_27] I have used Steve twice now to do jobs at my house. Today I had him come by and replace some of the ""criss-cross"" redwood trellis that was used as a ""skirt"" around my deck. My puppy had chewed on it. Steve showed up with the right materials and tools and was done before no time. He is very handy; courteous; and does excellent work. I plan on using him again for my next ""fix-it"" job that I don't have the time; skills; or tools to do. [REVIEW_28] This place completely exceeded my expectations; and I had a great experience. The space and equipment were very clean; the therapist was strong and responsive; and pricing schedule is very fair- the best deal in town for trained massage. Also; I was a walk-in and they saw me in less than 5 minutes. [REVIEW_29] Would not recommend; the customer service is awful. Went for Sunday lunch only about 8 customers in the building; Took 15 minutes before they got our drink order. Ordered iced tea but they must've had a shortage of ice; the tea was cold but only few pieces of ice.  Once we got drinks we placed appetizer and food order. Took only 55 minutes for our appetizer and food to show up at the same time. Only to find hair in the food. I made comment to employee about taking so long to for food and they replied ""well we only have two cooks"" then she waked away. Like its my problem that the appetizer and food took so long. While I sat and waited I started noticing how careless and rude the staff was yelling back and forth across kitchen; cooks yelling to employees that were sitting down eating at kitchen area. feminine male playing around thrusting his hips as if he was having sex with someone. I threw up in my mouth and lost my appetite at this point. I figured it was just a bad batch of employees until I walked outside and look back at the building and seen all the torn up American flags. The owner and management obviously just don't have respect for anything or anybody. [REVIEW_30] Finally a local barbecue master with a genuine passion for getting it right. The brisket is to die for... Melt in your mouth slice of heaven made right in Roslyn!!!  Mike knows how to make barbecue pork;ribs;chicken;brisket and cornbread like he grew up in the Deep South where this kind of cooking is religion. Guy Fieri would be calling this joint; ""winner; winner chicken dinner""   Take out or eat in bring your appetite to try the brisket sloo-ow cooked for 19 hours at 190 degrees the best in the area.  Get in early because he sells out. You don't want to settle for a McRib sandwich!!!",17
86,"[REVIEW_1] Went here for the first time yesterday. Staff was pleasant and food was really good. My husband especially liked the Vietnamese coffee! Too strong for me; but he loved it. [REVIEW_2] Yesterday; our breakfast experience was the low point of our stay in Montecito. The dismissive wait staff and the manager overseeing a nearly empty room who couldn't be bothered to refill a coffee cup so eclipsed the food that we will never return. The food was decent; but the ""service"" earned our server a $2 tip. [REVIEW_3] People in this place are generally friendly; but do not make the mistake of going to Katie.  She went through my hair like a bulldozer-- slapped colour on it in less than 5 minutes and cut it in even less time.  I think she was in a rush to get out of there (it was late in the day); but then she shouldn't have agreed to take me on.  The whole thing cost me close to $200; and I was shaken up by the experience. [REVIEW_4] My husband is a huge fan of Chinese buffets; but this place did not live up to its name. At all. We got there 5 minutes after they opened expecting fresh food on the buffet. It tasted like they brought out yesterday's leftovers. The baked chicken was over cooked. Most items were sitting in puddles of grease. Everything we put on our plates was cold or lukewarm. The egg drop soup was bland. Sushi had very little variety (every roll had cucumber and crab; and then something else on top). They do offer a military discount; but at the higher Sunday price it was NOT worth it. There are other options in town. Stay away from this place. [REVIEW_5] This studio is thoughtful and educational. With all of the knowledge that the teachers have and share; I find that they maintain a very down to earth feel and are not egoic in their style. The focus is about the teachings; and helping people to not get injured in their practice. Attention to pain and mindfulness around pain left me feeling well taken care of. [REVIEW_6] I got Bait & Switched too!!!!  They had the exact used Hyundai Accent I wanted on their website for 2 weeks.  I called to make an appointment for later the same day and drove an hour from Philly to get there. Upon arrival they informed me that it had been sold just 2 hours prior to my appointment but no one called to inform me.  Instead they were offering me a brand new car which would have been thousands more!  I just checked on their website and the car is still listed in their inventory!!! [REVIEW_7] Had the worst experience I've had at a restaurant in a while here. Ordered take out and waited over an hour and fifteen minutes for our food which was just a breakfast sandwich and grit plate. In that time; only one employee came to talk to us; not to tell us sorry for the wait; but to tell us that they didn't have enough grits to complete our order.  The food is good; but not good enough to wait over an hour for. [REVIEW_8] WORST location  out there. I eat Chipotle 4+ times a week; and every time I go to this location I have a terrible experience.  Today; my burrito (with almost no meat put in) tortilla fell apart while trying to wrap it. He then tried to rewrap it and failed.  It came apart again on the third try... as well as the fourth.  When the fifth tortilla broke in three different spots; he still wrapped and gave it to me.  Also; have the ingredients were stuck to the previous tortilla tries.  Like I said; I eat Chipotle 4-5 times a week; but I'll be going to Qdoba after this. [REVIEW_9] This place was a great! It was first time in Philly and I was starving. The guy that took my order was super nice. I got the buffalo bello and a chocolate & vanilla milk shake ! My meat eating friend got the chick'n fajita wrap and he devoured it. Even the water was delicious with orange & lemon slices in it. I'm definitely going back next time I'm in Philly !!! [REVIEW_10] Fantastic. We did carry out; tried a few different tacos; the tostada; and bean dip appetizer. Everything was delicious; fresh and interesting flavor combinations. Favorites were the tostada; poblano taco; and the el cochinita. Definitely a different flavor and vibe than traditional Americanized Mexican restaurants. Can't wait to go back. [REVIEW_11] Very surprised as this was by far the best butter chicken and aloo goobi from any Indian restaurant in the past. Service was a bit slow but worth the wait once the food came. [REVIEW_12] It has been a long time since we ate here. But we were getting tired of the same-old; same-old and the husband suggested we try it again. What a mistake. The place looks old and tired. NO atmosphere. But the service was prompt and friendly. We ordered our meals.... fish and chips for me and an open-faced roast beef sandwich for my husband. My dish arrived with three healthy  pieces of scrod in a very eggy looking breading. Fake fries (you know; reconstituted potato parts shaped like fries) and a very mayonnaise - y tartar sauce. The fish was edible. The fries were not. But the real surprise was the horrendous meal my husband was served. Instead of beautiful roast beef; he received fatty; chewy brisket; shiny gravy and those awful excuses for fries. We should have been suspicious when they offered neither a baked potato nor mashed potatoes. Nevertheless; he dug in. He hated the dish and ate very little of it. The waitress questioned him about it and he said he didn't like it.   She came back to tell us that the meat came from the end of the roast (thus the overcooked texture and heavy fat content). Even as we paid the bill; the owner apologized for serving such a lousy cut of beef. Then why serve it???? It makes no sense. In the meantime; my fish was just passable. Not inedible... but not very good.   They did reduce the bill and gave us a $5 off coupon. But too little too late. If you hurry; you will find the coupon in the entrance to the restaurant.   We won't be back; so you are welcome to use it. Though I wouldn't recommend that you do. [REVIEW_13] I really love NOSH! I originally came to try their Happy Hour on a Friday; but arrived at almost 8pm. Luckily they have their Bubbles Bar from 4-close on Friday's where select Rose and sparkling wines are just 4 bucks. Fast forward to the following Friday and I'm in again but this time to actually try Happy Hour. My bartender from last week remembers my name and order! I was able to have ""my usual"" rosé; since I'm a frequent diner now. I was also able to try the bites from their happy hour menu. First of all; the mac and cheese was bomb AF! It was cheesy and seasoned; something I was not expecting; so kudos! The pasta; which was either orecchiette or tortellini was al dente... not my fave; but I'll order that Mac and cheese again any day! I also enjoyed the sliders which were good; spring rolls and poutine fries. All of the food thus far was really good; came out quickly; service was great from hostess to bartender to server; to managers checking in. NOSH is really a cute spot to unwind at.  I'm really happy to have found my now go to Happy Hour spot. [REVIEW_14] It was first time visiting. and I didn't know what or how should I order my burger. but the cashier  didn't help me at all. She was so unkind and rude. I will never come back here again!! [REVIEW_15] I've been eating here when I'm in town for about 5 years and this place used to be great. The food has severely gone downhill in not only quality of ingredients but also in ability to prepare a dish. I ate here for lunch today; saying that so hopefully a member of the staff reads this and remembers me; I ordered the dry hot pot and my gf ordered fried dumplings and the cold noodles with chili oil and we shared each other's food. The mushrooms in my dish were impossible to cut even with a knife and the rest of the vegetables had a freeze dried feel to them being the consistency of bark. The pork was a bit rubbery and only had flavor from the oil draped over everything that seemed under seasoned as well and definitely tasted old. This was labeled in the menu as a 10/10 spicy rating; it was at most a 2. I didn't bother saying anything because of how rude the waiter/host was; but I'll get to that. The rice was cold and clumped together in chunks that led me to understand that it was previously microwaved. The dumplings looked ok; but the dough was undercooked and the sauce was just soy sauce that had no care whatsoever put into it. Her noodles were very bland and whoever prepared them obviously doesn't care about their food. The noodles had the same flavor deprived oil from my dish in it; just disappointing really. This type of food is supposed to be robust and I've eaten at a ton of places across the country and internationally that do care about what the put out. This place doesn't care anymore. The man that seated us was incredibly rude the entire time. He huffed and puffed and stomped his feet when I asked for the real Chinese menu instead of the Americanized Chinese menu. And; they used to throw shade if you asked for the Americanized menu; now it's the opposite. After we were done we both had a decent amount of food left and I decided to take it to feed to the raccoons that come around my house. They look cool and I like to feed them. Anyway; the take out container was dirty from previous food in it! I was blown away; especially when I pointed it out and the rude person pretending to be a man grabbed it out of my hand and stormed; literally stormed off before I was even half way through my sentence. I was calm the whole time; not sure what this guys deal is. Then came back with the same container that he washed! He washed the dirty container that should never have been used in the first place and thought that was acceptable. I will never go here again and I hope they go out of business so no one has to be punished by this Handy Nasty food. Disgusting food and disgusting people; except for the one guy who worked there who said goodbye to us. He seemed mortified because he knew what the cuck host just did to everyone in the dining area throughout the day and I assume throughout his life. I hate this place; and I can only hate it because I used to love it. [REVIEW_16] Went there because it was featured on one of those TV food shows.  Wow.  This place is excellent.  At prime time the lines are long; outside; and wrap around the corner.  Expect to wait-Expect the wait to be worth it!  The food is delicious.  The service moves with the precision of a well-trained military unit (that's a good thing!)  Prices are fair; portions are generous.  The variety and unique items make the meal one of those things you'll talk about afterwards; you'll share your positive experience with friends and family; and you'll go back. [REVIEW_17] Great food! The homemade bread on my dlt was delicious. My husband loved his pork burger. Chow chow was a sweet slaw; which was good but a little too sweet for me. Service was outstanding!!! My husband and I split a salad and a beer and they split them both! Atmosphere was nice and relaxing. Can't wait to come back! [REVIEW_18] This place moved locations and when I placed a call in order the guy on the phone didn't even tell me or give me a heads up! I called to find out the new location and he gave me wrong directions! I was super bummed! No thanks! There is a ton of great Thai places in town with better service! [REVIEW_19] Yelp; please let us start giving zero stars!  Terrible.  No concept of service or how to shift employees to help high volume times.   Almost no one dropping off cars at 6:30 pm to take flights and a line going out the door to pick up cars yet there are still employees just walking around out side while 2 ladies are slammed.  It has  already been 40 minutes and we will be in line another 45 minutes at this pace.  of course...the self service kiosks are broken too.    This place is a train wreck. [REVIEW_20] Stopped by on my way out of Nashville for a quick bite. Mistake. As soon as I walked in the manager made an offensive comment about my appearance (I have long hair and a beard so she referred to me as ""baby Jesus"") Not a good start.  Food quality was very poor even for a buffet; and the stock was extremely low on everything; and what was there was cold and unpleasant. Drinks never were refilled.   I tried to salt my food and discovered not one; but all salt shakers were caked with water and unfunctional. When I asked the server for fresh salt she proceeded to check the tables and came back several minutes later with what she claimed was ""the best she could find"" rather than making a fresh bottle; and it was just as caked as the others.   If I had to say one positive thing about it; I'd say that I'm 90% positive that the steak was made from actual beef!   Do yourself a favor and never go here. [REVIEW_21] I love Mint! I've only ever had good meals here. Fairly priced; delicious food; good vegetarian options. [REVIEW_22] I absolutely love this hotel. It is certainly one of my favorites. Upon walking into the building; to your right you will enter the lobby. The lobby is adorable with eclectic decorations and 1 million places to sit that are very comfortable. They serve wine every day from 5 to 6 PM; it's nice to relax down in the lobby with a glass of wine and friendly staff..  Speaking of the staff; they are amazing. Checking in is fantastic; Jasmine and Kayla are the ones I dealt with and they are both wonderful. The hotel concierge Roshid is a very friendly and knowledgeable concierge; they are very lucky to have him on staff. The housekeepers are great; the rooms are immaculate. What I love most about this hotel are the fantastic bathrooms; I'm not sure about the regular rooms; but if you get a king spa room; the bathrooms are absolutely amazing. You have a freestanding tub; and a large shower and you can jump in between the two should you be so inclined ha ha. The decor is so attractive; incredible wallpaper; beautiful rugs; everything seems brand new and they keep it in perfect condition. This hotel is a must for anyone visiting Philadelphia. They make you feel right at home at the moment you step in the door. The pictures that you can get from inside the rooms are enough to make up your whole trip to Philly LOL. But if you want to get out and explore Philly you're only steps away from the Liberty Bell and a historical museum. Right in Center City or the old downtown area; you'll find lots of historical information about Philadelphia.  Definitely stop in and stay at the Monaco; you won't regret it! [REVIEW_23] Schlafly Bottleworks is more than just a microbrewery. Yes; they do brew their own beer onsite (tours are available) and they have a nice bar area with plenty of seating.  They also have great; affordable food. I'm a big fan of their burgers; but have never ordered anything at Schlafly's that I didn't like. They also have a large outside patio area and sponsor a weekly farmer's market during the summer on their parking lot.  I appreciate that they use local sustainable food and that the entire building was smoke free (even the bar) before the smoking ban went into place. They keep a fire going outside all winter in the patio space which gives the smokers a warm place to huddle.   I've also been to several events with the back room with it's own bar and their bartenders will let you taste the beer until you find one you like. [REVIEW_24] The only thing I love more than their coffee are the baristas that work here. It's a quiet; good place to read a book and enjoy a multitude of drinks they offer. [REVIEW_25] Food and service were excellent;   We had a Country Omelette; and the Wildflower Signature Scrambled plate.   The omelet was large and truly a masterpiece; with really fresh mixed greens on the side.  The Signature Scramble was basic; but good; a little on the small side. For most people it would be just enough.   There is plenty of parking; efficient service; friendly hostess and big picture windows.   The prices! Inexpensive! Really a nice surprise.  Tip: They have home fried potatoes; but only on Sundays.   See the photo of the dining room I posted. [REVIEW_26] This was a great experience for me! Just what I wanted my wedding dress experience to be! Jayna was so sweet and really listened to the type of dress/style that I wanted.  She was actually the one who picked my wedding dress from the rack!  She just knows what looks good on people.  Loved my experience here and definitely recommend The Dress.  Also; have her do your alterations- she knows what she is doing! [REVIEW_27] Life-changing pancakes; amazing selection and the waitresses' tshirts were really funny. Also loved the decor [REVIEW_28] I expected to go there; try the veggie burger and leave without giving it that much thought.  It turns out a place that sells a lot of beef might become the new vegan hot spot of Philadelphia.  They label their menu which shows they are attuned to the concerns of vegans. So they meet the bare minimum. Good thing they surpass it.  For starters; get the pickles and slaw ""bare snack"". Two kinds of vegan slaw. The whole thing is fantastic. It made the perfect sharing item for a party of three.  They also have so many toppings and sides that are vegan. The vegan sandwiches they offer can be modified to add these items such as chickpea onions and stout onions.   My wife and I split two vegan sandwiches; Guadalupe burger and the Mazuma tempeh sandwich. Both were great. I especially appreciate that they make their own veggie burger. No Morningstar Farms here.  For dessert we had the vegan carrot cake. The only item we ate that we didn't love. I would skip it net time.  Seriously; the meal I just had there compares very favorable to the many great all-vegan restaurants in Philadelphia. I am very very impressed. [REVIEW_29] Dined at Kanella three times in three different situations (dinner with my wife; dinner with my family and dinner with friends) - all were greatly enjoyable. Our favorite restaurant in Philadelphia.  We came for dinner at Friday night. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful and most importantly the food was amazing. We are from the Middle East and the food made us home sick in a good way. The Kanella Platter was the star but other starters were very good as well. In fact; everything we ordered was tasty; with the Stuffed Peppers being the highlight of our dinner.  The owner/chef really cares about the customers. [REVIEW_30] I have NEVER been disappointed by them! I have tried practically the entire menu and it has all been tasty. Great portion for the price and relatively quick service considering everything is cool to order. Nice hidden jewel on the Northwest side of Naptown.",18
87,"[REVIEW_1] Had a really good time here. The staff was quick and friendly. We had the breakfast buffet which was really good and had a great selection. Definitely will be a place I recommend to my friends. [REVIEW_2] This restaurant is over rated. My family went because we were new to the area and have heard great things. They are very packed; hardly any parking and you always have to make a reservation. I thought I would be happy with the food. However; when we went for dinner the menu had some food that sounded good; but my husband and I struggled to find something that we liked. We did get the California roll and that was good; but we were not impressed with the teriyaki chicken. It seems like our experience is one of the few; but personally we will not be going back again. [REVIEW_3] This place has went so downhill over the years...it's really sad. Used to be the go to place for a beer; watch the game; and hang out. But nowadays they are often ""out"" of the beer I order (fat tire; yazoo; etc); the menu is like a third of what it used to be; and the service is mediocre to say the least. I live in Goodlettsville so this is close to me but now I drive the extra 5-10 minutes and go to Buffalo Wild Wings. Maybe they'll clean this place back up...and a staff turnover would probably go a long way. [REVIEW_4] Three Dog Night had a popular song that hit number 1 on the charts in the 70's. It was appropriately called ""One"". In the lyrics; it stated; ""One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do"". That may be true in love; but when it comes to dining sometimes you just want to dine alone.  If you do; avoid HWK.   Not once; but twice I have been turned  away when wanting to dine here as a single person. The first time when I called to make a reservation; the young lady who answered informed me they preferred not to sit single diners at tables and that I'd have to eat at the bar.  At first I was content with that arrangement; but then she continued to tell me that  those eating at the bar can not select from the entire menu. At that point; I decided not to make the reservation.  I wanted the true HWK experience. After all the reviews have been amazing.   The second time; I stopped in for early lunch while shopping the main drag in Maplewood.  Once again; I was told I'd have to sit at the bar and order from a ""limited menu"". When I asked if I could be seated at one of the hightops in the window; she told me she needed to save those for parties of two. The kicker came when I asked if they were already reserved and she said; ""no"".  I ate else where that day.   What I do not understand; is why can I go to Chicago dine at such top restaurants such as; Girl and the Goat; RL; The Pump Room; Table Fifty-Two; The Purple Pig; Frontera Grill and The Publican and be welcomed with open arms. Many of the chefs at these restaurants have been on Top Chef and published cookbooks.  How is it that their establishments are welcoming to the lone diner; yet a small Maplewood restaurant is not?  I understand they have a small space; but if you are going to sit single diners at the bar; let them order from the entire menu. Before posting; I shared this review with other friends who are single diners and being women; they said for them they would not feel comfortable eating at the bar and would not eat here if a table was not an option.   Disclaimer: I did dine here as a couple opening week and was not impressed. I contributed that to opening week jitters and wanted to give them another chance. It is a shame that I have not had that opportunity. [REVIEW_5] I had a horrible experience here. The waiter was great but as I got my appetizer; there was it has a hair in it. Next the noodles came out mine was fine but my friend has a huge hair in his. I thought he was joking until he told me. After that it ruined my appetite; I gave the noodles back and they didn't even give me a new one; I thought I should've got the food for free at that point.. never eating here again [REVIEW_6] Provi is such a wonderful person I came here because of her. The chipotle chicken avocado sandwich and chicken noodle soup is just to die for. [REVIEW_7] The vegan pecan turtle bar was by far the BEST vegan baked good I have ever consumed. My non-vegan girlfriend was also impressed. She also loved the poptart that they recommended for her. If they added more vegan options to their daily menu; I would not complain!! [REVIEW_8] This establishment is truly the worst. (And I'm not just saying this to fit in with the 50 other 1-star reviews.)  For starters; the owner is an absolute jerk off who has no problem getting wasted in the bar and kicking you out if you disagree with him. I've seen it happen at least twice. They should bite the bullet and place a sign over the door stating that differing opinions are not welcome.   I've also been privy to him taking advantage of drunk people and telling the bartender to add drinks to the tab that weren't ordered or that were ""on the house"" for other people.   Then there is the ""manager."" I can't count how many times I've seen him berate paying customers; get into loud; heated arguments; and throw people out.   And let's not forget the aforementioned bottled water debacle.   I'm not sure how or why this place stays open through Nashville's boom. I would come fairly regularly for a while to give it a chance but I eventuslly couldn't do it anymore.   I certainly hope this is not the impression of Tennesseans tourists leave with. [REVIEW_9] Had the brisket sandwich with two sides and a drink for 9.99 - Great barbecue at an affordable price. Wonderful side such as potato casserole cream spinach baked beans green beans [REVIEW_10] I'm not a coffee afficianado; but the coffee is good; noticeably better than Starbucks and the regional chain; Kahwa. They also have good matcha; as an alternative to coffee. Edibles are high quality but limited; and I rarely partake. Coffee and edibles are served with good ceramicware and glassware.  The room and seating are spare...nothing soft and cushy...which is fine with me; but might not be if you're expecting ergonomic or cushy seating. It can be crowded; with many 20- and 30-somethings in pairs and with laptops and cellphones. Most people are well bahaved; meaning take their cellphone calls outside. But even when crowded; I've always found a place.  Exceptional staff - attentive; professional and skilled. [REVIEW_11] I almost don't want to rate this restaurant 5 star....only because I'm selfish and want to keep this place under the radar.  I've not had one thing on the menu that wasn't delicious; and I've eaten here at least 6-8 times in the last 3 weeks.   Steaks are delicious; and if you like pasta; Try the Tuscan Gravy w homemade fettuccine. If you've had breakfast at their beach location; you find some of the same items; but some prepared differently from the beach spot.  I had the sausage gravy and biscuit; it was probably the best I have ever eaten. My companion ordered the lox eggs Benedict and loved them.  Happy hour 2-6 everyday with drink and app specials. I love the Thai Chicken Flatbread  There is Outdoor seating; and two indoor dining areas. Great ambiance and the service is quite good as well. The drinks are generous and delicious.  Parking can be a bit tricky; nut go around the corner and there's parking behind and a back entrance. Enjoy; and I might see you there! [REVIEW_12] It's bad. More breading than meat. Frozen Chinese food; it's a cookie cutter pop up Chinese restaurant. [REVIEW_13] So... ima make this very short and simple just got a haircut from this place; thought I would check it out because of the great reviews of yelp.. worst haircut of my life.. it seemed like the hair stylist had no idea what she was doing. My hair is completely uneven. So bad I actually felt like crying and I am a 20 year old guy. I went to a different barber shop later that day so they could shave my head. Maybe they cut women's hair really nice but guys do not come here unless you want people laughing at your haircut. [REVIEW_14] The last 2 times we took our dog here; our female dog got kennel cough.  Added vet bills over $100.  Never going back to this place again. [REVIEW_15] The guy checking you out is horrible.  He seemed high to me. It took almost 20 minutes to get through the 'exit' gate.  When I went to return the car I was distracted and forgot to fill it. I asked the attendant where I could go; and he was helpful.. AS I went to leave; I told the gate guy (ironically the same one) what the attendant told me to say. I have a contract that started last Sunday; and I just need to head out to refuel. The guy gave me deer in headlights; and said... ""what do you mean re-fuel"".  I said; I forgot.... and need to fill the car  up before I turn it in.""  -What do you mean fill it up?   Do you have a contact.... then 5 minutes......... Really [REVIEW_16] Great Indian spot where (IIRC) one had been formerly; but closed. We dined-in on a quiet summer Saturday; and found the service extremely hospitable and attentive. Each dish was satisfying; with emphasis on quality and attention to detail. I'm extremely happy to have such a good Indian option available again here in South Philly. [REVIEW_17] Ordered the shrimp skewers; they were garlicky and delicious. The chili was spicy and good. I saved the best for last; the turkey club was the absolute best that I've ever eaten. The wait staff was friendly and quick. Put this place on your to do list. [REVIEW_18] Sublime! Came here on a recommendation from a NOLA native friend and was not disappointed. Everything we ordered was incredible and our server Gary was excellent. Great cocktails; amazing appetizers (tuna tartare; hamachi curry; marinated shrimp   I strongly recommend this restaurant; definitely will go back next time I visit New Orleans. [REVIEW_19] So disappointing on so many levels. Have been coming here for years - and the quality of food has fallen off a cliff. Strike one - we shared an artichoke to start - and clearly it had been prepared beforehand (eg; cold on the inside - but the flesh was cooked through)  Strike two - my wife had a Greek salad - and it clearly all came from a bag and was extremely overdressed with tasteless dressing.  Strike three - I had grilled yellowtail which was basically execrable - could not even finish it (overcooked and an inferior-frozen piece of fish - unacceptable for SB).   In short - great setting; good service - but with such horrible food - not worth the visit. This place really needs to up the quality of food - or it's going to end up just another lower State dive for the tourists. [REVIEW_20] STAY AWAY! I am a gold member; so I stay at Hamptons frequently. I have stayed here before; and it seems to be under constant construction. My room was dirty. I came back to give them another chance as it is close to my appointments. I show up for a four night stay; and they send me away because they are booked; but tell me I can come back tomorrow night. Seriously? I couldn't believe that. I wont be back. [REVIEW_21] Cantina has hosted several of our Breakthrough Network business mixers and they do a super job. We pack the place with over 150 people during the mixer. The service is great and they work closely with our team to make our events a huge success. [REVIEW_22] I have curly hair and spent too much time with stylists who cut my hair poorly.  I've found found a place which not only makes my hair bounce and flow but also does wonderful color and highlights.  As another reviewer noted; they are Deva cut professionals and are trained to cut curly hair. The work is thoughtful; thorough; and artful-I get compliments on both my color and cut. The salon is comfortable and homey; it lacks that ostentatious attitude that most salons project. The pricing is reasonable and fair--especially compared with other Main Line and Center City salons. [REVIEW_23] The worker was awesome; this is a review for the company.  The price paid isn't in alignment to the service provided; it is just expensive. The worker is still paid hourly; which motivates him/her to work the hours. I believe it is a better way to hire someone off craigslist and pay them to do a service; rather than hourly. [REVIEW_24] Feeling compelled to write this review laying in bed; dreaming about the Pro Tap Burger - what every other burger out there wants to be when it grows up. I don't love this burger just because it's literally a block away from me - I would walk 500 miles to fall down at Pro Taps door for this burger. I am also a HUGE fan of brioche buns. Fries are covered in a garlicky herb situation unlike any you've had before. Do yourself a favor and skip your kids recital; blow off that friend you've been playing phone tag with for weeks... but don't bring your friend who's all like ""are these gluten free vegan fries?""... get some of their seriously awesome beers; a burger; maybe start off w some of their mac and cheese? I'm just sayin..... [REVIEW_25] Well worth the wait... and weight  The Banana and Nutella with caramel is my favorite. [REVIEW_26] Great place. Started coming about a month ago prior to Lightning game. Has become my go to place. The food is excellent. Being new it's not really that busy early in the week but I like that. Great tunes on sound system. Great bartenders ( Jenifer; Ryan; Josh ) [REVIEW_27] Wonderful experience. My my mother and I went; we had Landon and Gil and they both did an amazing job. Perfect pressure and hit every area with tension. Many parts of the experience can be customized as well including cream vs oil; scent of the room; sounds for the room; and much more! I would highly recommend this studio! [REVIEW_28] Coorie was such a pleasure here! Had so much fun wine tasting with my girlfriends and she made the experience very enjoyable. Nice atmosphere and decent selection of wine. [REVIEW_29] fantastic!! Perfect for romantic dinners or meals with family or friends. Delicious traditional Italian everything. [REVIEW_30] Great Cranberry Orange Muffin and Caffe Latte on a Saturday morning. Great ambience and fast service.",18
88,"[REVIEW_1] I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights for the memorial day weekend. I had one of the worst experience in this hotel. When we checked in I saw bed mattresses and pillows lying outside our room. When we entered the room; the air conditioner was not working. So I went down and told the person on the reception about it and she told me that a engineer will come soon to fix it.  After 20 min no one came. I had checked in with my family and it was a very hot day (max temperature: 94 degree Fahrenheit). This time I called the front desk and the phone was busy. I tried it few more time and I got the same result.  I thought let me get few more stuff from my car and then call them again. So when I was passing through the front desk on my way to garage I thought of talking to the receptionist. I found no one there. I came out of the hotel and I saw the receptionist smoking and chatting on her mobile!!  Eventually the engineer came and told us that there was a leakage in some duct. So we were moved to another room where the air conditioner was working.  Next; the ice vending machine was not working on our floor. I tried it one floor below and again it was dysfunctional there. So I had to go to the second floor to get some ice.  When we came back to our room next night (after spending the day in an amusement park) we found that the room was not cleaned. The bed sheets were in the same condition when we left in the morning. The trash was not emptied. The shampoo and conditioner were not replaced.  Please don't waste your money here. I will never recommend this hotel to anyone. [REVIEW_2] Unbeatably good ice cream!  Love maple walnut; and they had it with blondie bits -- to die for.  This is THE ice cream place to go to if you are in Nashville -- forget the others! [REVIEW_3] Completely unprofessional and pathetic. I called last week to get price quotes on a battery and brakes. I spoke to someone very nice- he gave me two quotes; fairly low but close to other shops. I call today to schedule a time to come in and the prick who answers the phone; his name is either Mike or Nick (and quite frankly I don't care what he's called); tells me there is no battery even close to that price. He ""blames"" the quote on me; saying ""I don't know how you came up with that price?"" Then I told him I'd like to speak to someone else and he says ""no; we won't do a battery for that price; so bye-bye"" and he HUNG up the phone. NEVER NEVER call these people. I can go to Walmart before I deal with these assholes. [REVIEW_4] I have heard tons of good feedback from people about this restaurant and have planned to go eat there because of it. But i feel a bit disappointed in their customer service; i had been calling for a week for their catering services and no one ever called or texted me like they said; they didn't have prices to offer and only one person apparently does their catering quotes. If you offer catering and want to gain profit you should have something set. I ended up having to get a diff person to do it but was looking forward to their tacos. A bit bummed; maybe in the future i might eat there but I'm dissatisfied in my service as a potential client. [REVIEW_5] Terrible; just terrible!  They need to tear this place down immediately.  I remember going here in the 80's for decent pizza & to a movie; but time has passed this place buy.  I went into Kmart to look for backpacks just a week ago and even that was a bad experience.  All there stuff looked old and outdated.   Why don't they turn this place into a Target; its practically empty anyway.  Either the stores have gone out of business for lack of shoppers or wisely moved elsewhere.  Sorry to see this location die a slow death; but its no more than an eye sore now. [REVIEW_6] This place is awesome the food is dynamite . Super friendly service. And the. Coup de grace was the flan made in house fresh and believe me I've tried flan everywhere; there's is exceptional. The price was right on point. My only suggestion to make this place go into the stratosphere is if they had a liquor license. [REVIEW_7] I went there once years ago I believe I cut my order down when the employee went from picking up trash to picking up my bagels No glove; not even paper.. I don;t recall all the details; but my immediate thought was it's another establishment that has no concept of hygiene and exploits the lack of oversight..To top it off; the bagels were far from fresh Needless to say; I haven't been back But I realize many people don't care about cleanliness. If that's you; you'll enjoy this place. [REVIEW_8] The blue version of Razoo; this is a bunch of sweaty tourists who will crowd and probably vomit on you.  Everytime i walk by the place; House of Pain is on:  ""Jump! Jump around! Jump! Jump around!"" [REVIEW_9] My fiance and I both visited this restaurant separately a few years ago; and neither of us enjoyed it.  Yesterday; we thought we'd try it again; together.  We walked in the restaurant and were seated at a table by the bar immediately.  There were two people at the bar and two other tables seated.  The host (may have also been our server) asked us what we wanted to drink.  Ten minutes later; the same man came back to our table; told us he had a ""brain fart"" and forgot what we ordered to drink.  We politely gave him our drink order again; and after at least five more minutes; we still hadn't seen him again; and we left.  The bartender; who walked past us at least 3 times; was at the bar on her IPad about 3 feet away from us when we walked out.  We gave them a second chance; and we won't be back.  We each have at least 20 years of restaurant experience; so we understand what service should be; and there are too many other choices to give this place another shot. [REVIEW_10] Terrible selection of food. No ""real sweet tea"" first and last time visit"" anywhere that doesn't carry real sweet tea automatic gets a 1* [REVIEW_11] I dropped off a suit that I needed cleaned last week and was told to pick it up on Friday. When I came in I was told it wasn't ready yet and I could pick it up on Saturday. I come back on Saturday to find them closed for 3 days. Now I have to go buy a new suit for a funeral today. This is very unacceptable [REVIEW_12] Despite a recent renovation; the Black Sheep is dingy and dirty and the sloppiest; most unattractive hostess (that is until I saw our waitress) sat us at our table upstairs. Although it was 10 pm on a Wednesday night; she was hesitant about sitting a party of two at a large table. Perhaps she was expecting a sudden stream of late night diners. The waitress was as sloppy and disheveled as the hostess. No makeup; no hairstyle and clothes that looked as though she found them on the street. I ordered something from the menu that did not have goat cheese listed as one of its ingredients; but she argued with me that the menu did have it listed. I showed her the menu and corrected her. She was rude and had a nasty attitude. I guess I would too if I looked like her. It was $30 for a burger; a salad and two Diet Cokes.The staff is arrogant; the place is filthy and the food is perfect for those who don't care about their health or appearance and like to stuff their faces with a bunch of high fat; high cholesterol; high calorie greasy food. No thanks. [REVIEW_13] Do not do it unless you just want to drink. We had the hummus platter. It was ok at best. Then for the nachos. Gross. Sent them back and ordered the BTL. Took one bite and asked for our check to get the heck out. We are both just crossing our fingers we don't end up sick. [REVIEW_14] Went the other night in a group of 13.  We had a great time.  Chef Poon is so much fun.  You can tell he truly has a passion of the culinary arts.  The best part you feel like your actually eating in the chefs kitchen.  My only suggestion is bring a big appetite because there is so much food. [REVIEW_15] I had such a great experience at Salon Fiber on New Year's Eve morning. I had been going to a salon in South Philly for years but never really clicked with the stylist I went to. I ended up getting an email from my old salon that the stylist had moved on; and since I've been spending most of my free time in Phoenixville; I decided to try out a new place there; and I'm so glad I did! Everyone at Salon Fiber was friendly and accommodating. I even got to make friends with the cutest 2 kids while we were waiting for Amber to finish their mom's hair. When it was time for my appointment; Amber took a look at a couple of pictures of the cut I was interested in; asked me some clarifying questions about what I was looking for in regards to length and texture; and got to work. I get a little antsy when I have to sit a long time for a haircut and I was really impressed with how quick and thorough this cut was! Amber was really friendly; assured me that my hair isn't as thin as my old stylist always described it as (which over time gave me a complex about thinning hair!); and gave me a cut I am so happy with! I think I've found my new regular salon and I can't wait to go back in a few weeks! [REVIEW_16] Wow!!!!   What an awesome Cuban. I was googling places by my work and thought I'd give it a try. 10 stars!!!  Everything was so fresh!!  Can't wait to come back and try the other Cubans. [REVIEW_17] The food at this location was amazing. I throughly enjoyed the food and service provided by Ciara (I couldn't find my receipt; so I'm not sure if the spelling is correct). However; Ciara was pleasant; responsive; quick; and knowledgeable about the menu and the surrounding areas. I would definitely visit this location again!  P.S. the jalapeño cornbread was delicious. [REVIEW_18] Great place for a large gathering. I was there for a private party and they have a great space for it. The cocktail menu is very good; and the good is great - would reccomend the black forest chocolate cake if you like chocolate. [REVIEW_19] Saw this on our way to Art Museum and sculpture garden.  Looked interesting so we stopped to check it out and it was large and impressive. Lots of history and it's a great cemetery.  I wasn't aware Nola has so many nice cemeteries. There are like 6 on this road and I really enjoyed exploring here for hours. [REVIEW_20] I have visited Mucho Burrito over the years here in the Edmonton Area; but this location by far is troubled.  In my humble opinion the more negative or cautious reviews of this particular location are accurate and are consistent with my own experience of the place.  For my own experience; the presentation and cleanliness of the restaurant is fine.  You are greeted with a modern looking fast food restaurant with some nice branding about clean eating.  But once you speak with staff the experience unravels.    I found staff to be more involved in whatever they are up to rather than customer service.  This can involve on going conversations amongst each other; or something else that is not readily apparent.  In any event; some staff are completely distracted or disengaged.  My order took a while to come out; and it required corrections which added more time while customers continued to line up.  Within 30 minutes after enjoying the meal; I became violently ill; and the rest of my evening was basically spent nursing myself back to normal.    I made a complaint many moons ago about this to Mucho Burrito's website; but be forewarned I did not get any follow up whatsoever from them.  This is a demoralized business to the core.    If you are craving Chipotle or some other Mexican branded place; do not come here.  You will be better off for it.  In fairness though; the Downtown location has been more consistent and I cannot speak for the other locations yet. [REVIEW_21] Pathetic experience with them. I ordered for rava masala dosa and vegetable uttapam to take out. They gave me dosa which is as good as burnt. Packing was so bad that the dosa layer has stuck to the white sheet of wrap. It did not smell good either. I called them and explained the story. I was expecting an apology and someone to provide us with the replacement if not refund but nothing of the sort. They did not even apologize; forget about refund or replacement. i shall be disposing the dosa as is. Uttapam was not very good either. It tasted sour and cilantro seemed old. I could not take it more than few loaves. Remaining will go in the dustbin as well.  Such a disgusting experience with them [REVIEW_22] Great staff; service and food!  I ordered the kale salad (OMGosh - good!); short ribs tacos and the fried cauliflower- a MUST - even if you don't finish it all. [REVIEW_23] Was once a great place to eat but I will not order from here again just got a stake and bacon sub all I found was raw fatty pieces of meat I'm guessing that was the bacon. Small pineapple and beef pizza well I really think the meat is old and no good because it was dry and the way the cheese was on the pizza it looked microwave. Being from the New York area originally this is NOT how they cook in ny. [REVIEW_24] By far the WORST Taco Bell ever.  First problem was we found hair in our food and it turns out to be one of the rude supervisors and refused to even help us out and denied us our money back so the general manager who was awesome helped us out and refunded us. Then all of a sudden tonight after months of not going back to this we decided to and we specifically asked for our nacho cheese that's comes on the burrito to just put it on the side like all the other t bells do we never got charged for it and my boyfriend is deathly allergic to it and for a soft taco instead of hard shell. Of course it was all wrong cheese everywhere charged for the nacho cheese no soft taco and the young lady who took our order tried to argue with us saying ""you didn't say that"" last time I checked the customer is always right. Working in the food industry i know good service when i see it and she didnt have any of it. Her voice; attitude; body language all wrong. The manager at the time accommodated us. He was polite and so nice. But the young employee however was horrible and shouldn't be even interacting with people. Pathetic attitude; laughing as she got our order wrong and horrible service all around and nothing done about it no apology...nothing. This taco bell just needs new employees and people who actually pay attention to what's going on instead of goofing off. [REVIEW_25] The most professional salon! They give you refreshments when you come in and never mess up my hair! [REVIEW_26] There is no help in the appliance section. If you do receive help they don't know what they are talking about. Bad service. Sears home Appliance store in Springfield is definitely a better option if you're looking to get great prices and great service [REVIEW_27] I very rarely eat fast food but when I need that fix; Chick-fil-A is it.  I just had their chicken biscuit and was very happy; the Chick-fil-A standard for being clean; prompt; tasty and courteous is well met here; the staff is doing an awesome job and I really appreciate it because it is so far the opposite of what I find at many other places. [REVIEW_28] On 3/5 (big snow day in Nashville) a couple of friends and I went to Local Taco in Sylvan Park for dinner.  When we arrived; the place was jam packed; and we knew there would be quite the wait.  I live right by Local Taco; and frequent the place.  Food is always delicious; along with the margaritas!  The Shrimp Taco is my favorite; along with the Local BBQ (try it out!)...   My friend got her food on a separate ticket; and awhile went by; and I still had not received mine.  It took a little longer than usual; but I figured it was because they were so slammed.  A few minutes later; the girl who took my order came out and saw my number was still on the table.  She asked if I had gotten my food yet; and I said no; and she apologized and said she'd be right back.  Then Bryan Haas (I'm guessing he was the manager at the time); came out with our food; apologizing.  Long story short - I received AWESOME customer service from the Local Taco staff; and Bryan Haas especially.  They comp'd our food for the delay; and gave a gift card to return as well.    I told him the gift card wasn't necessary; but he insisted. Bryan also slipped his business card in there; which I thought was very professional and sincere.    I just wanted to give a shout out to one of my favorite restaurants and the all-star staff that works there.  Going above and beyond for your customers is what makes everyone love Local Taco so much :)  Thanks!  And see y'all soon! [REVIEW_29] Sat down over a half hour; only miso and drinks served. Waiting for actual food ordered or someone to cook it ....waiting ... [REVIEW_30] The worst body shop ever. They will blame you for their mistake. Don't go here if you have a Mercedes or BMW.  Honestly they did a good job on the paint but they are careless. They scratched up my leather seats; drain my battery; and my panels is not installed right.",12
89,"[REVIEW_1] i live a block away from this place; yet took nearly a year to venture that long block to what may be my favorite bar in the city.   the bar is pretty low key; rarely very full; and a decent place to bring friends or a date. the noise level is acceptable with a great jukebox and; in the few times i've been there; douchebros have been minimally invasive. there was one night that some guy was trying to read a book and some dudes were being total assholes right behind him. i mean; it is a bar; so i don't know why anyone would be trying to read there; but these guys were exceptionally annoying. that was an isolated incident; though.  now; i didn't drink beer regularly until a few months ago (i don't really like any of the shitty beers that typically populate college parties; so i'd usually just try and get drunk off of vodka or gin); so i don't know how qualified i am to judge the beer selection. from what i've seen at other bars; prohibition's beer list isn't super extensive; but there's a good variety of beers both on tap and in bottles. the bartenders are nice; attentive; cool folks who know what they're talking about way more than i do.  now; the food is nothing out of the ordinary; but damn it's good. i don't like green beans so i haven't had those beer battered things everyone's having conniptions over. the polenta fries are absolutely perfect: spicy; salty; fried crispy on the outside and velvety on the inside. the aioli that comes along with it makes me want to cry just thinking about how FUCKING GOOD it is. the wings are banging; too: good size; tender meat; extra saucy and a 4/5 on the heat level. i had a burger once; and it was decent; but i won't be having it again.  it's very reasonably priced with most beers on tap being 5 or so dollars. the food is a little more expensive than usual for bar food; but definitely worth it.  and that sign just tops it off. five stars. [REVIEW_2] Just stayed here for a conference for three days and nights. What a lovely hotel. Very clean and sleek and the staff was friendly; knowledgable and professional. Everyone had a smile and was willing to help. The food was amazing and the Market Place buffet had great choices; all fresh and delicious. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for comfort and class in downtown Indiana. [REVIEW_3] Caution- Absolutely - stay away.  There was nothing about the food that can redeem how unusually bad the food was here.  While the staff is very accommodating; you're better off skipping this restaurant.  I worked in a very large well known Cajun/creole restaurant and what we were served was very bland and poorly prepared.  Red beans were definitely from a can. I didn't taste any of the distinct flavors of red beans n rice.  There was no ham hock flavor; no bay leaf flavor or discernible mirepoix flavor.  The collard greens tasted like they had been boiled without any additional seasoning and served; poorly drained. I couldn't eat it.  The jambalaya was also very odd; most definitely from some prepackaged mix.  The jambalaya barely had any meat in it and was definitely not close to anything like jambalaya. They aught to be ashamed of calling that Jambalaya. It was more like frozen mixed vegetable rice pilaf; seriously. Jambalaya ""jambon a la aya"" the jambon (ham) is the core of the dish; seriously. Wtf.  If the management is reading this: revise your recipes and quality check often. It's a downward spiral when you sacrifice quality.  One of us who are the crawfish etouffe had terrible food poisoning.  I think there are issues with storage; food rotation; labeling and training.  Several hours after writing the review;  I was sick. [REVIEW_4] I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND !!Late lunch (1:30pm) on Monday 7/16. No more than 4 tables. Seated at a dirty table. Waiter came after about 5 minutes asking if I wanted water (it's Reno!!). Came back minutes later with water and said my glass of wine was ""being poured.""  He wanted to take my order. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich (no onion ). Wine (finally) came right before the food. Fries were stale and cold. Chicken inside of sandwich was so chard it was hard to eat. Waiter NEVER returned until he brought the check. I complained about the quality. Was ""comped"" the sandwich. Never apologized to; nor given any sense of caring. Food was awful; service was inattentive and it was over priced. [REVIEW_5] Went here for the first time today; and it was AWESOME! Highly recommend; service was wonderful; food was amazing and fresh; all over a good time! Not overly expensive and a great atmosphere! [REVIEW_6] What's not to love? this place is actually Laotion; or food from Laos. which is why you may find dishes slightly different then Vietnamese. So first off the food is amazing and they are open late everyday! until midnight on weekends and 10pm week days. There is a Shaved Milk Ice bar which is very good treat while you wait for food or after you eat!; it's condensed milk on shaved ice with choice of many toppings from fresh fruits to weird jelly cubes. There is also and fresh Ban Mi bar; which is a pork sandwich with arrangement of toppings. the staff is nice and decor is cool. [REVIEW_7] I concur with all the other 5 star reviews!  I'm always skeptical as to reviews really be honest these days; especially in this case since mostly all of them are 5 stars; but it's ALL true!!  This boutique is very nice and clean; and Lori did an excellent job with the waxing and making me feel comfortable.  This was my first time getting the blue hard wax; and I'm sold!  I don't ever need to go back to the regular wax again!  Another plus is the option of a ""custom wax"".  I left there very pleased; and already made my appt. to go back!  Soooo grateful to Yelp reviewers in helping me find this spot! [REVIEW_8] We had a great time at the pool a few weeks ago.  Dylan; the young man working at the pool; was very attentive to us. He got us towels and searched for 2 empty spots for us! [REVIEW_9] I am positively LIVID.  I went to check my account balance and what do I see? An overdraft fee of $220. How could this happen? My card was never declined and there are two large fees deducted from my account.  I called TD and sat on hold for 45 MINUTES. I don't have that kind of time. Granted; the guy that was with me was nice and helpful; but never mentioned anything about the wait time until I brought it up. I asked about these fees and he said ""Just so you are aware; TD Bank's new policy is that when you have insufficient funds; your card will not be declined. It will be run through; and you will be charged an overdraft fee."" OH THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME NOW; JERK.  I have too many salty words that are unacceptable in the public domain; so I'll stop now.  Needless to say; I am switching banks.  Sort of UPDATE: I thought you Yelpers would like to know that last night; when I was depositing the cash that I didn't have into my account via ATM; I flipped off the cameras. TAKE THAT; TD. [REVIEW_10] Give as much attention to my review that they gave me as a customer. 1.  Food sucks if you can even order it 2.  Service Sucks Worse - Service was just as bad at the bar as at a table; on two pretty slow nights 3.  Good Beer Selection; but I would rather go to a beer distributor; bring it to a McDonalds; and sit there to eat and drink (and I haven't been to a McDonalds in 20 years).  At least there you don't expect any service. [REVIEW_11] Like the whiskey selection; the bartenders are lively and knowledgeable. The food is great; especially the burgers and sandwiches. [REVIEW_12] The best coffee in town. Makes it hard to go back to SB ever again. I'm a Frappe fan but also love the hots and have never been disappointed by the quality. They even know what we like and will have my husband's ready before he reaches the window! [REVIEW_13] I have eaten here several times - never been disappointed.   I usually have one of the meat and three specials...sometimes just vegetables.   It is southern comfort food...nothing more and nothing less.   The staff is friendly...always. [REVIEW_14] Never been here before today and never ever going back. All I came in for was some to-go queso. $9 and 10 mins later I've got some pretty nasty cheese in a styrofoam to-go cup and two pop corn bags filled with chips. Also the inside was pretty bad and the person that checked me out at the register had to be no more than 10 years old. [REVIEW_15] I would eat here every day if it was a little cheaper. Fourth time here and I've never had a bad experience. [REVIEW_16] Gosh.... I still just love this place.. I moved away but my burger buds remained with whiskey village.. [REVIEW_17] Horrible service. Sat there for 20 minutes before server finally came out. Claims no one told her we were there. Guess she couldn't see us. Had to get something quick because we had tickets to the playhouse theater. Got to the restaurant with more than an hour to spare. She took our order and said she would be back with our bread. She never came back. Another 30 minutes passed; so we decided to leave. Just as we were leaving our food showed up. They couldn't believe we were leaving.  Felt good to stick it to them for a 55 minute wait. Luckily the playhouse is a short distance away. [REVIEW_18] UPDATE to my used car purchase ..... it's been a little over a month; and the detailers wax and scratch remover has started to wear off; and wouldn't you know; scratches EVERYWHERE on the hood and trunk. Deliberately hidden by a professional detail job..... you seriously need to hate yourself if you are going to buy a car here. I guess this is why they were so hell bent on selling a dings; dents; and scratches warranty. [REVIEW_19] The food was terrible! the sushi had no flavor. Beef was soo dry.  Potato salad was nothing close to a salad. Food was not good at all. [REVIEW_20] I would give this place zero stars if I could. They advertise 2 paddle boards and all year only one paddle board and no paddle. Filthy conditions.  When u contact front desk they say management will call u but they don't. Units are not clean when students move in.  They allow animals. Configuration of the apartment is horrible. Like living in a cell block. Kitchen is too small. Not enough area for food prep or dish storage.   They put on a good show when students are checking the place out but it is bait and switch. Don't rent here [REVIEW_21] Weird location...looks like somebody's house..ancient equipment just like the workers. Probably an okay place to take your great grandma for a perm real quik; creepy old guy is the receptionist and barber. Super creepy. [REVIEW_22] My boyfriend and I went for dinner on a Friday night. We sat at the chef's bar which allows you to see the food being prepared in the open kitchen. It was fun to watch until we noticed that one of the cooks was tasting the food with a spoon then continuing to use the spoon to cook the food. He did this with every dish he cooked; reusing the same dirty spoons to taste; stir; and serve everyone's food. We reluctantly ate our food anyway. It was tasty; but we both got sick the next day. Will never go there again. I would have said something to the head chef; but he was present in and around the kitchen the entire time; so I had to assume he saw this too and did not care. [REVIEW_23] YES!!  MUST HAVE!  1. Banana Foster French Toast 2. Shrimp and Grits!  They managed to somehow get bananas fosters INSIDE the French toast so when you cut it it's creamy oozey and so beautifully delicious! MUST GET!  The shrimp and grits has a barbecue style touch to it along with bacon and cuts of bread as you can see in the photos!  If you're a couple between 130-175 pounds this should definitely fill up the both of you!  Best breakfast spot so far! [REVIEW_24] I love the atmosphere in Hyde Perk not only do I love being in the north end but this little coffee shop is so comfortable and relaxing. Its quiet at just the right times and I love their friendly staff. I tried their Kombucha it was a blueberry flavor and it was so tasty! Definitely going back to study or just hang out with close friends! [REVIEW_25] Wow what a terrible spa. I can only speak for the manicure/pedicure aspect because I did not get a massage. Typically; you go to a spa to escape and relax - you can not do that here. It is small; dirty; and the staff is terrible.   I walked in and the receptionist was on the phone - he did acknowledge that I was standing there; but several staff walked by and did not offer to assist. Finally; after two other guests came in behind me; someone came up and took me back - just to get me out of the way. Asked what my name was and left. Did not offer me water/refreshments of any kind. I've had better reception at the local nail salon. Then I had to wait for 10-15 minutes for my technician to finish up her current client; which I didn't mind because I leisurely picked out my color. When it was my turn; the nail technician was shaky and rushed. She cut my cuticle and I bled. She was sick and kept blowing her nose into her shirt (gross!!) and took time outs to really blow/dig in her nose with a tissue right in front of me! Lady; you are touching my hands with yours; you are blowing bacteria into the air; if you are that sick don't come to work - *Management; if your employee is that sick do not make them come in! You will lose clients.   She gave me the worst hand/arm massage I have ever had (that is usually everyone's favorite part; and the technician's opportunity to shine!). No pressure was applied; and she just basically rubbed lotion into my skin and made a snarky comment about how my skin was so dry is was just ""drinking up all the lotion."" Yes; I realize it's dry; probably due to the 20 degree weather and wind outside; but thank you for making me feel self-conscious.   When I went to leave the receptionist was on the phone again; but did actually put them on hold to get me out of there. I opted to put everything on my room charge; which resulted in extra fees but I didn't care. There was a blaring sign saying how they preferred cash gratuity and that there would be extra fees associated with putting services on your room. Yes; everyone prefers cash gratuity - but how tacky can you be?!!   Overall; it was an extremely disappointing experience. I have been wanting to stay at the Monteleone for years and made it a priority to experience their salon. My gel nail polish is already chipping and it hasn't even been a week. Spa Aria definitely needs a overhaul and I would recommend you go anywhere else but here. [REVIEW_26] WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!! Originally ordered rolls to go; asked to double check and they yelled at us for just wanting to make sure if we had all the rolls we ordered. After we left; we found out we were missing not 2 rolls like last time; but 4!! so we called back; asked to speak with the owner. We got on the phone supposedly with their manager; and the manager said he would give us a gift card for next time we came. Don't you think I should get my food that I already paid for? why do I have to wait til next time to get reimbursed for what I should have already gotten. The ""manager"" said the owner wasn't there but later when we asked if we could talk to him; the same ""manager"" turned into the owner. Then the ""Manger/owner"" hung up on us for trying to figure out how to fix the situation. I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN. You do not get all of what you order; and best believe I will let everyone in  the Reno/Sparks area know to not eat at Sushi Minato. Unfriendly; rude; and a big rip off. I only left 1 star because there is no option for no stars. [REVIEW_27] Great work; great service! I am so grateful for Elite Fireplace - we had an emergency issue with our chimney liner that caused us to have to shut off our heat. I called over a dozen chimney places and Elite was one of the few to call me back; and was willing to prioritize my emergency faster than anyone else. They are professional; use high-quality materials; and have high standards for their work. They give a discount for payment by cash/check; and also offer payment plans. Thank you; Elite! [REVIEW_28] This Mcdonalds has poor management. Went there once and they informed us they were out of straws. Another time The shake machine for st pattys shakes was down and they didn't know when it would be up. Went there 2 weeks later and it was still down. Went there once for take home and when we got home there was no hamburger in the buns. Just a bun with pickles; tomatoes; and lettuce. Finally I got the message that these people did not care about their customers and stop going there. [REVIEW_29] I had high hopes for this place since the parking lot was full. I ordered fish and chips; and got peas and macaroni and cheese on the side. My companion ordered the knackwurst and saurerkraut with mashed potatoes on the side. The main courses were all right. The macaroni and cheese was inedible for me. The flavoring tasted very artificial. My companion's mashed potatoes tasted like paper. We have eaten at enough establishments like this to know we can get better quality food for more affordable prices. We will not be returning. [REVIEW_30] This is one of the WORST venues I've been too and definitely won't be coming back. I came here over the weekend to see Primus and I was so disappointed in both the layout of the place and the people that worked there. First the security at the door was confused; they took our tickets and then walked back in the place; leaving us outside. When he finally decided to return he actually asked us for our tickets (even though he took them with him). After rummaging through his pockets...tada! He found them and finally let us in.  We were escorted upstairs to the bar & restaurant where we were told they were out of food menus and they would give us one when it came available...so that's when the waiting game began. We waited about 10 minutes for a menu and then it took about 15 minutes for someone to circle back around and take our order. After placing our order it took them over 30 minutes to make one chicken caesar wrap. Once we finally got our food they proceed to ""kick us out"" because they needed to get the top floor ready for the show - so frustrating! The night continued to go just as frustrating. The layout of this place is rectangular and very long so if you don't get there early and man your spot; good looking getting a glimpse at the stage. They cram over 1000 people in this small club and if it wasn't for the TV screens people would have missed the show entirely. I feel horrible for about 70% of the people that came to watch the show; there is really no good seat in the house. Also their security is absolutely horrible; they were constantly rushing through the crowds to stop people from smoking or taking pictures. When they weren't shoving you to get through they were shining a flashlight in your eyes. We also had security shove us out of the way so he could stand in front of us and take video himself of the band that was playing. They are so unprofessional and rude. If you plan on going to see a show here; I wouldn't recommend it especially if there's going to be a lot of people and a sold-out show because chances are you won't see anything. And I'm serious when I say it that only about 30% of the ticket holders could see anything; the rest of us were just standing around watching the TV screens. This place is super lame and I won't ever be back.",14
90,"[REVIEW_1] I am in love with this place! ! A charmingly friendly and helpful staff. Incredibly diverse excellent spread for breakfast. Chocolate covered strawberries as a treat in the room. Great location across from Redding Terminal.  Great happy hour in the hotel bar!! [REVIEW_2] After today's lunch; Iris has moved to the top of my New Orleans favorites lists--no small feat in a city where restaurants are numerous and culinary competition is fierce. Iris excels in every area: food; drinks; service; atmosphere; location; music and overall graciousness. I made the reservation for 10-15 people; not knowing exactly how many in my party would show up. Iris pulled out all the stops to make sure everyone had comfortable seating and even prepared an overflow table for us. At no time did we feel jostled or rushed; which is a common fine dining concern.   The layout of the restaurant allowed diners to move freely to and from the table and to exchange seats as needed. The music selection was fun and unique; ranging from the Magnetic Fields to Johnny Cash. It was also quiet enough to be enjoyed while allowing conversation to flow unimpeded. Our waiter had excellent timing and anticipated our every need.   Though they don't have a full drink menu for lunch (I hear they have an amazing mixologist for the dinner hour) they do offer a selection of martinis and wines. One of the guests has accounts with several high-end bars in the Quarter; and the drink list passed his muster. Our table settled for Chardonnays; Perseco and chilled shots of Chartreuse; though I hear they have several types of absinthe as well.   Our group began with slices of warm; heavenly bread that Iris bakes in house. We continued with an assortment of salads--I had the Hollygrove arugula with warm goat cheese; niçoise olives and balsamic vinaigrette. It was fresh perfection. A few of us opted for the mussels; which I heard were delicious. For my main course; I had a wonderful drum with onions prepared in a tangy soy reduction; which was an elegant complement for the fish. I also heard rave reviews about the gnocci and chicken.   All the entrees were creatively arranged and selected; and at no point did I feel overwhelmed or that any fuss or pretense had gone into the food. I also appreciated that the portions were European-sized (it always makes me laugh when other Americans list too-small portion size as a complaint even when the food is well-prepared!). Iris prepares a lot of their basic ingredients in-house; and I appreciate that the kitchen makes a point of incorporating gulf fish and produce purchased from local; farmer-friendly markets.   We settled on the prix fixe menu; which was $20 a person for appetizer; main course and the dessert of the day (the best strawberry sorbet I have had yet). With the added drinks and tip it came out to under $35 a person; which is an excellent price for such a delicious white-linen lunch. No matter the size of my group; I will definitely be returning! [REVIEW_3] This place was definitely the best dining experience I had in NOLA during my week-long trip! My husband and I walked in without reservations during their Sunday Jazz Brunch. We waited about 40 minutes; but we had the music and ambience to keep us occupied.   Despite the place being ridiculously busy; our server didn't rush us at all. He encouraged us to take our time browsing the menu and placing our orders- definitely one of the friendliest servers I've encountered.   The food here was absolutely amazing! The complimentary bread and butter was very nice. My husband and I started off with the seafood gumbo; and it was delicious! Both of us had a sea bass entree and it was definitely the best fish I've ever had. The fish came with a side of green beans and this DELICIOUS sauce that could make anything taste great. We finished off with chocolate orange ice cream and creme brûlée for dessert. The next table over was raving about their bread pudding; so I'm guessing dessert is usually a hit all around at this place.   The coolest bit about my experience here was that my husband and I got seated where Ronald Reagan sat on his two visits to Mr. B's (far left corner)- Reagan just so happened to visit on my birthday!   Our bill came out to be $100+ but it was worth every penny. If I'm in NOLA again; I'm definitely revisiting Mr. B's. [REVIEW_4] Great food at a great value! My favorite items on the menu are the Pho; Pork Bun; Bahn Mi; and the pot stickers are delicious!The Bahn Mi comes on true French bread (I recommend the pork belly). As for Pho; I usually get the beef with extra bean sprouts. Pork Bun is my favorite menu item; it comes with vermicelli noodles; cucumber; carrots; and more. The best server there her name is Tim. Ask for her if you want to get the best service! [REVIEW_5] Pulled pork and fried fish are great.    Don't miss the sweet tea.  My wife had the white beans and cold slaw really good much better than my Mac and cheese and potatoe salad.    But a must eat if you love bbq. [REVIEW_6] Talk about amazing breakfast this is your spot I love the meat lover omelette with the biscuit gosh the best!!! And the customer service forget it amazing everybody is so kind and sweet!!! [REVIEW_7] Cool little place that has amazing cookie dough! It tastes just like real cookie dough; but is made without eggs or dairy (chocolate chips technically are handled with dairy). They'll let you try whatever you want so have at it until you find what you like. 1 scoop is more than enough. You can get it in a cone or a cup just like ice cream! It stays if you need to take it home for later or the next day! Love it! Staff is super welcoming and will tell you all about the flavors and process if you have questions! [REVIEW_8] Horrible horrible!!! Got a flat tire.. took them 3 hours to send somebody!! I know the flat tire happens but 3 hours??!! When I was only 20 min from the rental car center... I will never use them again.. I travel every week and thought I would give them a try.. [REVIEW_9] Quite possibly THE BEST restaurant in philly. It's a very personal; small place which requires reservations well in advance for popular dining days/times. Northern Italian fine cuisine of the highest quality by James Beard Award winning chef Marc Vetri. A visit to Vetri Ristorante is a special occasion in itself.  $$$$ [REVIEW_10] I have been to so many dentists; and Sonrisa is by far the best! No judgment; awesome little tips (like which tooth to start on when you're brushing); and Dr. Velez is so warm and kind. I used to get nervous and flake out on dentist appointments; but never with Dr. Velez! If you are ashamed of your cavities; to to Sonrisa; and you will feel better! [REVIEW_11] My boyfriend and I are visiting the Philly area from Pittsburgh and I'm so glad we found Bernie's on Yelp. The place is beautiful; the service is kind and efficient; the food is killer (I got the goat cheese small plate and the southwest burger) both were so extremely good. My boyfriend was super stoked about their vast beer menu. Our waiter Joel was glad to help when we had questions; he was great. I highly recommend coming here!  *definitely make a reservation on OpenTable. We were sat right away on a Saturday night at 7:30pm because of our reservation! [REVIEW_12] Everything went perfect! I don't shoot often so i was a little nervous; but the staff is very friendly and comforting. It was all very easy process; will def be back! [REVIEW_13] Giving five stars simply because the staff here has always been so great. Been in multiple times for various issues and always get very helpful service and diagnostics. The service manager in particular is the bomb! South 6th Ave Autozone is my go-to whenever I have a minor issue with my car or need to pick up a part. [REVIEW_14] Long story short:  It was West Philly Comics 3 weeks ago and I was sorry to see the shop move...it was conveniently located by my house around UPenn;  however; I followed them because the owner impressed me with his customer service.    He calls to check in with me about picking up my books; the service is great; the staff respectfully provides opinions on other graphic novels I might like.  Check them out.  The shop is smaller but the area has some good restaurants to chill or geek-out with friends or just read some killer graphic novel you bought.  Drake [REVIEW_15] We are from out of state and came here for breakfast. Loved the location; was super cute and quiet. We had our breakfast outside near the train tracks. The waiter was so nice! We had our first beignets and OMG I'm hooked! I'm a little bummed that i won't have anymore when I return back to Oregon. All the food we ordered was simply amazing! [REVIEW_16] Very cool place. The food is fresh and delicious and the donuts are so unique and seriously good!! I have had the fried chicken sandwich as well as the burger sliders and both have been divine! Highly recommend. [REVIEW_17] I compare this hotel to a pig wearing lipstick.  It is still a pig.  Nice beds; yup; updated bathrooms; yes; new carpet in room; yes. Nice staff; yes. So why 1 star?  It is a dump and whoever decided to put all this new stuff into rooms that smell like mold and mildew should be fired. I am staying here for a convention so someone else booked the rooms as I usually look at reviews before making a reservation. Heading that it was a Marriott and that is was an Opryland hotel; I thought; oh it will be nice. After walking into the room and getting the nasty smell hit me; I turned to the Marriott app to look st the reviews as well as on yelp.  Many other complaints posted. I asked my co-workers and 3 of the 4 people that I am traveling with also have the same smell.   Note to the management team: shame on you for booking these rooms without fixing the problem. [REVIEW_18] Greta hike! Views ; desert fauna ; peace and quiet and more. It's not easy; bring the right shoes and water. The grandkids (5 &9 ) scampered up with much stress; wife had a bit more work.Park at top of Alvernon. [REVIEW_19] Winner's is hands down my favorite place to karaoke in Nashville.  While there are some aspiring country music singers scattered throughout; I feel more comfortable singing my random crazy songs here with a group of friends. A lot of downtown karaoke bars are 80% amazing singers; 20% random drunk people. I like that I don't feel that I'm the only bad singer out there when I visit Winner's!   Plus; you never know who you will run into at Winner's. One night a random dude came in and sang ""Friends in Low Places"" with someone from our group who was on stage; it turns out the guy is a well known songwriter in Nashville; and he WROTE that song. Wow.  The prices are reasonable and you are sure to meet some new friends! Plus I love the patio out front and the randomness that ensues!   Note: karaoke is only on Friday and Saturdays :) [REVIEW_20] This place is amazing. First time I have tried Turkish coffee and LOVED it here. The veggie wrap and cheese steak is also great. This place gives off great vibes; there is an entire cafe section within the restaurant. I will definitely make sure to come back to this place if I am in West Philly ever again. 5 stars. [REVIEW_21] As a place super close to the Piazza; it doesn't strike you as a busy place with amazing food. This place has great service; with the bartenders and servers always extremely helpful and personable. The place is even packed on week nights. [REVIEW_22] This place has been around for years and it's still the best local burger/taco place in town. The fajitas are to die for.  Ultra-friendly staff and a fun; atmosphere.  Guy Fieri from DDD should visit here! [REVIEW_23] I love love love World of Beer! I have been to their establishments in FL; VA; MD; and this newer location in Exton PA. Every time I go I am never disappointed with their beer selection; and the food menu seems to constantly be improving. If you can't find a beer that you like at WOB; I feel like it is time to move on from the beer world and go to wine bars instead because this place is fantastic. When I go I usually get a new draught beer on tap and then a bottled beer from Evil Twin Brewing Company. Jeppe Jarnit-Bjergsø is the founder of Evil Twin Brewing Company. He has a cool story - "" gypsy brewer"" who launched his beer in Denmark; but then used friends brew rooms in ten places around the world to produce his beer. He is finally opening his first stand alone brewery in Queens; NY this coming spring. I feel like it is a little harder to find his beers; but not at World of Beer! As for the food; I have tried their wings; tacos; chicken sliders; cheese board; and most recently their fried pickles. All of the food items were quite tasty; and if you go during happy hour a lot of the appetizer items are discounted to $5 dollars a piece. Next time I am in Exton; I will be capping off my day here! [REVIEW_24] David did an excellent job repairing a small crack in my windshield.  Work was done cleanly and quickly and he even cleaned my car windows. [REVIEW_25] Super! In every way. Just attended the Blueberry Festival. Had a special steak sandwich and blueberry tart. Home made chips. Excellent and service rarely seen. Thanks! [REVIEW_26] Though seemingly Inconpicuous driving by; this turned out to be a good place to go for a good haircut. Good conversation and attention to detail means that I'll come back again to see if they can duplicate the experience. [REVIEW_27] I was lucky enough to spend 2 weeks in Boise for ""work."" Spent my free time drinking my way around Boise's great craft beer scene. I visited about 10 breweries or brewpubs and Payette was far and away my fav. Tons of beers on tap. I would guess probably 30. Fun custom 4 beer flights; and cheap too! Like hard to believe cheap. Beautiful building and space. No food; but on both of my visits they had a food truck parked outside. Great vibe. Oh yeah; and most importantly; the beer is excellent! [REVIEW_28] Best BBQ in Nashville!  Food is consistently amazing & all of their locations always a really fun; relaxed atmosphere. I recommend Edley's to all of my family and friends who come to visit. [REVIEW_29] This place is great.  Michelle is the best hostess.  What I really love is all the food combos.   It's amazing!  The beef bulgogi is the best And so is the miso. [REVIEW_30] the handmade orangina is delicious-better than the bottled version! and the croissant sandwiches are amazing!",28
91,"[REVIEW_1] As usual G and I had 2 great meals to celebrate his birthday of Wednesday. Food and service; as usual; was spectacular. The birthday boy had the prime rib. I always have th gyro salad; which is my fav. [REVIEW_2] Unbelievably the worst experience shopping I've had in a long time. Pre shopped online at home to find 3 of a particular tool chest they had in stock. Looked good. Drove down to the location minutes after confirming the stock. When I arrived I talked to no less than 3 associates who all were clueless as to where the item was. After being abandoned multiple times while they went to ""go look for me"" and then found these same associates helping other customers I decided to go up to the customer service desk to seek assistance. When I arrived there they also had no idea why their computers showed 3 items in stock but couldn't find them still. Ok so I begrudgingly agreed to have a new item shipped to the store (they couldn't figure out how to ship it to the store closest to me so I again; beaten down; acquiesced to driving down to this much further store to get the item I wanted.) I was told we'll have the item here in 1-2 days. Great. Fast forward to 5 days later. The store has no idea where the new item is. I wish I was making this up; but it gets better! They have no idea where it is! And tell me the order had actually been canceled on their end. But... it's in stock at another store even further away! I leave upset but determined to get my item. Fast forward. I'm now at the other store with the receipt for my initial purchase which was refunded because they could not find the item. Which shows a discounted price for my troubles. The other store now says they can't match the price of the original store because that was a discount they gave me and they are different stores. So finally I gave up and went else where. I've had some bad customer service experiences in my day but this one may take the cake. Cheers to you Home Depot. I salute your commitment to underachieving! [REVIEW_3] Once upon a time in the dusty town in the badlands of Tucson there was a Taco truck on the Corner of Wetmore and a wet Canadian. They had a hot-dog that had been hand made by angels from heaven that sing songs of magical enchantment until the drones of other Sonoran dogs are just considered devil songs. The food here is just like waking up from a long awaited nap after the heat of battle. No more local hot dog chains made famous from a lackluster Food network....just locals bringing the heat on from a truck made from dreams.   In this dream ...I will make this simple....I work very close to this place. I have been here many times over the last few years. So; they are consistent in their quality. There are other place in town that people think are the best for the famous Sonoran Hot Dog. This place is king of the Sonoran Dog. No one can touch them....kings.  Like mama said knock you out Kings! Asada Tacos; Carmelo's; condiments....all of it is legit. Come here...don't mind the dusty parking lot...this is Tucson. You are allowed to have a concealed carry and the right to super dank Mexican food. [REVIEW_4] Out of this world Shrimp Civeche!! The Mexican menu was an unexpected treat. I'd go back again just to have that. [REVIEW_5] Terrible American Mexican restauraunt. Extremely bland food. Excessively uncomfortable seating.  Had the fish tacos. Got food poisoning. Our chips had hair in it.   I'd rather eat at Taco Bell even if i had to pay the same ridiculous prices they have at Las Tortugas. 2nd worst restaurant I've been to in my life. [REVIEW_6] Salsa is absolutely terrible. Chips are great; but man that salsa lacks any and all flavor. No salt in it; no spice; no heat. The sweet potato and pork nachos were okay. It seems like a place that's overpriced and terrible because it can be due to its location. Up your salsa game.    ******************UPDATE***********************  So I went into their location on oak street after a fun night out with my buddy and I told him ""let's just go see if their salsa is any different than the other location. Plus; it was Endymion that night; so who knows. Everyone deserves a second chance.""  We sit down at the bar and my buddy goes to use the restroom. Bartender asks me if we're eating; drinking; or a little of both. I told him about my previous salsa experience and he nodded. Thinking nothing of it; I go to use the restroom after my bro comes out and upon my return I have the general manager; the owner (I think?); and a chef all gathered around me to have me try their new salsa! Apparently they recognized me from my yelp profile picture; and wanted to leave a better impression. Well they most certainly did. They did something that I'm not accustomed to seeing in restaurants: they cared.   To veer off into a tiny tangent for a second; of all the restaurants I go to; good food is usually just a percentage or part of the overall experience. You won't go into an Applebee's or Chili's expecting to be taken care of. You go in there; you lock eyes with your waiter's tired eyes; you know everything is nuked in the microwave; you order it anyways; you eat; you pay; you tip; you leave. Don't expect anything magical from Applebee's or Chili's. They don't care. It's a mechanical process that's specialized by corporate heads in nicer places to delude you into thinking you're getting great service; or at least are entitled to; but you're not. You know that. But that's now why you go there. But that's the difference between those chain restaurants and restaurants that care. So to bring my tangent back to my main point; La Casita definitely left a lasting impression on me by showing how much they care. And that's what you want in a restaurant.   They changed their salsa and I got to try it. Now to be honest; fair; and balanced I didn't like their new salsa either. But if you're going based off of flavor; it was a thousand times better than what I experienced previously. I've worked at a Mexican restaurant where they made their salsa in house; and my tastebuds can't speak for everyone as everyone has specific things they like and dislike. I just happen to like salsa with a bit more heat; tang; and pop. But their salsa is definitely unique and improved.  Have not had an opportune chance to sit down and dine there yet; but will as soon as I can find some time! If you're in the mood for ""Tex mex meets Southern California with an authentic Mexican twist"" as the bartender described it; then definitely head down there and be greeted by people who want you to enjoy your experience not because they're getting paid to but; rather more importantly; because they care. [REVIEW_7] My favorite Italian restaurant in Tucson. Family owned since the 1930's or 40's. Excellent lasagna and chicken parmesean. Why people flock to the Olive Garden over this place is beyond me.... [REVIEW_8] Very fresh ingredients with an authentic taste. Priced per taco to mix and match- which I prefer. Would definitely come back for my next taco fix! [REVIEW_9] I recently went to Ame for a hair cut and wedding makeup trial run. The salon looks lovely; and would have been much more pleasing if the receptionist had smiled; or offered a welcome. Neither were given. Though my hairdresser was polite; there was no genuine friendliness. The cut turned out OK; but not jaw dropping. I won't be harsh about the cut because I mentioned I didn't want to cut it too short because I'd like to keep it long for my wedding which is in October. She had asked if there was anything I was looking for and I replied with 'just a trim; unless you have suggestions'. She had no suggestions which I usually mark as characteristic of a hairdresser that either isn't creative or doesn't enjoy their job. I let it go though; and thought I'd wait till after my hair was dried before making my final judgment. The Blow out was horrible; even I could have done a better job than she did. I usually love the blow outs I get after my hair is cut because the hair is smooth and full of body. My hair was flat and boring. I had considered having her do my hair for my wedding but decided that if she couldn't do a decent blow dry she probably couldn't do an up do.  Once the cut was completed she took me to the front to check out. When I told the receptionist I had an appointment for make up she said 'Oh. Well; I don't see it and there isn't anyone here to do it. Do you want to make an appointment for another day'? When I scheduled the appointments I confirmed that I wanted both; and when I told there wouldn't be a problem I assumed both were booked. I had even told the woman booking the appointments that I live out of STATE and am only up on some weekends. I will not rebook any appointments with Ame; fearing that I would make a three hour trek to be told 'sorry- it didn't make it on the books'. Not worth the visit- unfriendly staff; poor service; and unreliable scheduling make this salon the worst I have ever visited! I'll be finding another salon once my move to PA is final. [REVIEW_10] Amazing Indian Food. Flavors most of us have never tasted before. Very friendly crew. Will come back over and over and over again! [REVIEW_11] Finally got to try the infamous prep & pastry; went in with mixed feelings thinking it was all hype no show but damn was I wrong. Ordered the steak and eggs sand which and an order of biscuits and gravy. 5 stars for my sandwich it was simply amazing!! The tri tip was flavorful but what really stole the show was the cheddar jalapeño focaccia! The sand which alone is what will bring me back to try the rest of the menu; the biscuits where delicious and the gravy was good.   Only thing that i wasn't impressed by was the Danish; I ordered the berries and cream cheese Danish and it seemed very plain and didn't stand out what so ever. There was another Danish that had a cream cheese and goat cheese mix in it so I will try that next time in hopes to redeem the pastry end of this establishment! [REVIEW_12] Yum and yum.   What a cute place w great food!  Have been twice and will be back again soon.   The burger; the crème brûlée pork belly special; are two instant faves.   I almost don't want people to know about this place so it doesn't get over crowded! [REVIEW_13] My visit this Saturday was a complete zero from the time we walked in.... The entire place was so very disorganized. The owner Jerry was screaming at his employees in front of customers and was very arrogant to his dining patrons. Our server admitted to me that things were not in place and that all of his fellow employees were confused and unhappy... after almost 10 mins of waiting for a server to acknowledge we were waiting for service he took our beverage order which took 10 more mins.... Server also communicated to us that no one took the time to review the ordering process with him prior to opening... The food did not match up to past experiences at this restaurant.. We always had Paul serve us and he always and still remains an excellent server; but his tables were all booked! We would have had a better meal at McDonalds!! Will never return to this Hell hole....: [REVIEW_14] Gypsy Saloon is and has always been one of my favorite restaurants outside of the city. Kim and Marianne are the owners and are totally hands on. Their menu is so fun and amazing. They are always consistent with their food and it has always been my ""go to"". Food is always fresh. The lobster mac and cheese is second to none. A fabulous restaurant not to be missed. Fabulous Brunch; lunch and dinner. You will not be disappointed.....EVER!!!!! [REVIEW_15] So I am going to come clean here up front.  I love this place.  I love the food; the casual atmosphere and the staff is professional and welcoming.   They are adjacent to my hotel every time I come to NOLA so I am here at least once per visit.   I wanted to step outside my comfort zone and try something else today for a late lunch but when I sat at the bar; ordered a glass of wine and was given the menu- I didnt see what I wanted ( I had seen it on the lunch menu).  I wanted oysters; as in welcome to NOLA - oysters.  They would not serve them at the bar so I drank my wine and left.  Here I am back at LUKE for my third meal this week.  And I got those oysters.  I also got a warm welcome; great beer and hello - happy hour!  Thank you John Besh for doing what you do.  #superstar #kingofnola [REVIEW_16] This place was amazing! I only tried their ice cream I really wanted to try the hot chocolate but didn't get a chance :(. Well the ice cream was great! The first night I came here I got a brownie sundae all for myself; brownie on the bottom and three scoops of ice cream topped with whipped cream and nuts. I finished it all happily! I chose pumpkin cake flavor which was delicious and smooth. I also got pralines and cream that was better than other praline ice creams. The Tennessee fudge was vanilla with fudge swirled it was good not too special.   The next time I came I got nutter butter ice cream that was really good had cookie pieces in it! I got the hot fudge topping over it and that was a great combination.   The service was great the workers were really nice and patient with me haha indecisive! They would joke around with me and let me sample all I wanted. Also no judgement for eating all the brownie sundae alone :) lol [REVIEW_17] I have been to so many dentists; and Sonrisa is by far the best! No judgment; awesome little tips (like which tooth to start on when you're brushing); and Dr. Velez is so warm and kind. I used to get nervous and flake out on dentist appointments; but never with Dr. Velez! If you are ashamed of your cavities; to to Sonrisa; and you will feel better! [REVIEW_18] I Love this food here! My first time here I was so skeptical because of all the contraversy serounding this place but I'm so happy I decided to eat here. [REVIEW_19] One out of three dishes was good. I ordered what was highlighted on Guy's show. The chargrilled oysters were fine. The pizza and the crawfish beignets looked like they should be amazingly delicious; but that fake white American-tasting cheese ruined it for me. End of story. [REVIEW_20] We've been using Ranger for ten years and they have excellent and responsive service. No one is better. [REVIEW_21] Got an amazing facial from Dianne and a relaxing mani-pedi from Vicki. This place is the perfect balance of peaceful organic spa and skilled; seasoned estheticians that  know their stuff. The products they use are natural; potent; and reasonably priced with a retail area full of products I can't wait to try. Great place just to stop in to buy a quick gift for someone or have a full spa day with all the bells and whistles. [REVIEW_22] Great date night place; can't wait to go back. We ate at the bar and enjoyed apps and a shared entree. Great service for a new spot! [REVIEW_23] So basically; you are going to be having a student cut your hair...  There is a ""teacher"" watching; but I don't think they are any better since the ""teacher"" messed up my cut more than the student did.  The haircuts are cheap; so if you are looking for something really affordable and want to take your chances; then go for it.  It will really all depend on how good of a student you have and how ready they are at that time to be a real stylist/barber.  My cut just so happened to turn out horribly; but I prepared myself for that since I knew what I was getting myself into.  Just prepare yourself for the same if you decide to take a chance to get a cut here.  DO NOT do it if you definitely need to get a good cut for an event or something because it can potentially turn out to be tragic! [REVIEW_24] We were happy to discover Luke thanks to the concierge at the Hilton that recommended it. We were hesitant to try it since it was adjacent to the hotel. Shame on us. We quickly discovered that celebrate chef John Besh ran the place and it truly was hopping. Our first visit was for happy hour shortly after we landed in New Orleans. Half price oysters and drinks; you can't go wrong. We quickly reordered another dozen as they were fresh and the sauces ere great. The sazerac was delicious.They have a nice wine and beer list too. We didn't originally order the fries but the table next to us were enjoying them and they looked so good; we had to try. We weren't disappointed. We liked Luke so much that we went back for Christmas day brunch. Equally good. Note that you really need a reservation at any time of the day. It's always busy. They say that you can wait and sit at the bar but it's packed too. If you call and they say that they are fully booked; try opentable; it seems like there are tables hidden away and available. [REVIEW_25] If I could leave negative stars then I absolutely would. I waited for a long time for my pizza in a relatively empty restaurant then walked up and was handed a BURNING HOT pie that I couldn't carry. Mind you I worked in food service for 6 years and I myself would never carry a pizza that temperature. After dropping a scalding pizzas I was called "" stupid"" and then given the impression they would remake my pizza. After waiting 20 minutes; I followed up with them. The assistant manager then told me it was all my fault and I'd be lucky if I got a couple pieces. End of story is worst custom service ever! [REVIEW_26] Probably the the worst place ever still didn't get all that was ordered!! The picture of margarita is just a picture of ice ! And margarita mix WOW only 1 waitress ! Was not but maybe 5 tables to wait on WOULD NOT RECOMEND COMING HERE . will not return [REVIEW_27] Awesome time with my first time to NOLA. Captain Jules did a hell of a job showing all of us and good time and super knowledgeable. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for something way out of the ordinary to do. [REVIEW_28] What an amazing dinner!  The wonderful ambiance of this restaurant was enough for me; but when they brought out our food; I was mesmorized by the flavors!  The owner/chef came out to greet us and he shared a nice glass of limoncello with us.  You will not be disappointed in any way if you come here for dinner.  Everything we ate tasted like the chef prepared each dish with a little bit of ""love"" in every bite. [REVIEW_29] My wife and I really enjoyed our dinner at Sbraga.  Thought the tasting menu was reasonably priced and it led me to try a few things I would not have otherwise.  The highlights for me were the Foie Gras soup (absolutely terrific) and the Brook Trout.  Probably the best fish dish I've had in quite a while; great flavor.    The service is very professional; your next dish comes out promptly after you've finished your previous dish (each time w/ a different server; not sure what the reasoning for that is).    One thing to note is that the tables for two by the windows on Pine are very tightly packed (you have to move your table for the person near the window to get out of their seat). We're pretty oblivious; but if you're easily distracted by the conversations of others; its hard to avoid it.   But overall; just a great meal. Highly recommended. [REVIEW_30] I posted this 2 days ago and somehow it's not showing...  Not too happy at this point.  I took my Gateway all in one to them because it wouldn't turn on. They replaced the hard drive in it. I took it home; set it up; went on FB. got off of it. Went to go on a couple of days later and it wouldn't turn again. They told me they would give me a $243 credit towards a new laptop...fine. I pick up the laptop (that not  all of my things were downloaded into properly); paid another $410.00. over $600 in total. We leave directly from there to go on vacation. At our vacation house; I want to go online and set up and play with the new computer; I couldn't get it to sign on; said the signal strength was too weak. In the mean time; on my old laptop; I'm sitting there watching television shows; my kids are signing on with their laptops; everyone's phone is getting wifi.  I take the laptop back to them; tell I want to return it ; it's lousy  First they tell me ""I can't return this; you were given multiple discounts on this"" I said no I wasn't ; I was given a credit (I paid over $600 for a laptop that costs $380 at Walmart)  Then told ""well; we can't resell this because it's used""; and that's my problem??!! Your computer dosen't work; I want to return it. I told them; look; forget the $243; I'll call that a wash; I just want back the $410 I just gave you. He ended up telling me they were going to check the computer and determine if there is a problem and let me know if they'll return my money. ......I'll keep you posted.",21
92,"[REVIEW_1] We had some great concrete's here this past Saturday.  My favorite is Vanilla with Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.  It makes me hungry just thinking about it. :)  My wife likes the chocolate custard with oreo's.  I've honestly never had anything here that wasn't good.  They have a sundae that has devil's food cake; custard; and hot fudge.  It is dynamite!  I'm always amazed at how busy this place is; even when it's cold and raining.  The staff does a great job of getting through the lines in a hurry.  Even if the line looks long; there's never a long wait.  I just wish it would have been nice enough for my wife and I to sit outside and eat.  It was too cold so we ate it in the car.  This is a St. Louis landmark; so if you've never been; it's definitely worth trying.  We try to come here several times a year; and it makes a great spot for dessert if you eat dinner at Trattoria Marcella. [REVIEW_2] Great sandwiches! They run about $5-$7 each and no they don't come with French fries but if you compare that to the average sandwich at a certain sandwich chain that claims to have 12-inch sandwiches; Javan's sandwiches at only 9 inches for the large size blow commercial chain sandwiches to smithereens. Super packed with meat; cheeses; vegetables; and whatever else you want; I've gotten the Chicken Club and the Philly Cheesesteak and both are to die for. French-fries here are great too.   Really great for groups of college kids; there's a lot of space indoors and outdoors; a large TV and old school arcade games. Definitely bring cash though; like most places in IV there is a 50 cent charge on Credit/Debit cards. [REVIEW_3] We were really surprised about this place! We had no idea what to expect; we didn't realize it is a Vietnamese restauaurant. But we love all Asian food & decided to try it. Plus; they have tons of Boba drinks to choose from - YUM. The place was pretty busy; even on an off time of day. And I always think if I'm in an ethnic restaurant and there are a lot of customers of that ethnicity; then it must be pretty good.  We both really liked it a lot!!!!! [REVIEW_4] Awesome I can't wait to go again next year best attraction around. Almost feels real in some of the houses. Haunted hayride was spectacular with fire torches machine guns chainsaws Churches demonic preist. Walking in the woods with a little glow stick is awesome and scary.Very real feeling. FORGET bush gardens howl o scream and haloween horror nights all you need is screamagedon. [REVIEW_5] Yesterday; our breakfast experience was the low point of our stay in Montecito. The dismissive wait staff and the manager overseeing a nearly empty room who couldn't be bothered to refill a coffee cup so eclipsed the food that we will never return. The food was decent; but the ""service"" earned our server a $2 tip. [REVIEW_6] Ordered 4 pot pies she said they have them made. Then manager takes one and says I have to wait 20 minutes for another one and I should order something else. Every time I come here there's a problem. Go somewhere else.  How is a 20 minute menu item that is all over TV even a fast food item? [REVIEW_7] Just walked out of this place.  When we got there the wait staff was all outside and we were the first people in there restaurant. We sat down they gave us water and then never came back. We waited 20 minutes again we were the only people here and NO ONE came and even asked us if we wanted a drink. We finally left without ordering after waiting the 20 minutes only to have a couple walk in sit down and have a waitress come up and start taking their order. Horrible service. This was our first time here and I wouldn't come back. @Nick from the blue duck  if you are at work now then you were one of the people who did this and yes it's unacceptable. [REVIEW_8] Bleh!! Their food is so gross if you order late and for pickup. I gave them more than one chance and I regret it [REVIEW_9] I went in here the other day for a rehearsal dinner and it was the worst service. 2 waiters had our table but we still had empty cups the whole time had to ask for breadsticks about 4 times; nothing we had was got it was all room temp; and he messed the bill up in the end. [REVIEW_10] We had dinner at Convivio right after it opened and we will definitely go back. There were a few minor quirks with the service and with wine being out of stock; but I'm chalking it up to the fact that it just opened and they were working out the kinks. The owner visited our table and he could not have been nicer or more gracious. The food was excellent...nothing to change there! I had the tortelloni pansotti; and i think it was the best pasta I've ever had. I'm sure we will be frequent diners . [REVIEW_11] My first time coming here was super awesome. So I decide to bring my Mom for my second visit. Unfortunately I was so disappointed and mad that I took my mom here for lunch. We waited for about an hour for our food and they even manage to messed it up.  Might come back for the drinks but not for the food. [REVIEW_12] Over priced drinks; mixing 4 or 5 different liquors and adding juice should NOT cost 15.00; and its not top shelf liquor either.  2 crab clusters and 2 pieces of corn should NOT cost 25.00! It's a shame since I live right up the street; I keep trying to give this place a chance; but every time I leave disappointed. I'm not even going to speak on the horrible parking. ..this place sucks ass ! [REVIEW_13] I was excited about the opening of this restaurant. The location is amazing and I felt it would help to welcome the cruise visitors as well as provide ""revitalization"" of the area. I don't know that they know anything about Mexican cuisine; but then again; the choice of name should have told me that. It might be an intent to be witty; but they know about mexican food as much as they speak a language that does not exist. Was the food Tex-Mex? no. Was it; maybe; a glorified franchise version of what a taco could be? close. The location is fabulous. Tons of potential there. The place itself is like a franchise is. Nothing peculiar or memorable. The music is loud and definitely not in Spanish. It is a try to compete with Hooters. Tons of very young and inexperienced servers who stood around the kitchen-dispensing counter that can be seen by all the patrons sitting around. All expressions of waiters and staff easily read. It is a new place; and we were instructed that most of the menu was not yet available. Quite limiting as of right now. We were given the standard chips and salsa of some restaurants. The chips were crisp and thin. Lovely; the actual problem was how to scoop up the guacamole and queso fundido we ordered with them. They crumbled and broke every time. We ended with a kind of tortilla soup/puree of sorts. The salsa was rather sweet. It tasted like marinara with some roasted chiles in it. Not spicy at all; and I ought to know because everything is spicy to me. The guacamole was definitely fresh. Want to know how I know? I had a whole avocado slice inside the green tasty mush. Needless to say; the thin tortillas presented a challenge. We cut it in pieces and used a knive to spread it on the tortillas as if they were crackers. Our order was brought to the table and about three minutes later; a confused waiter brought another for us (of the same we were eating) and was baffled as to what to do with the obvious mistake. She returned to the counter and the whole crowd of staff members seemed uncertain as to what to do with the extra queso fundido; refritos and guacamole. We ordered tacos! yes; they hablan taco! we got: cold flour tortillas; stiff upright and if you tried folding them into a burrito they broke. Sounds familiar? we have all bought ""la Banderita"" and eat them unheated at home. I wanted steak taco; but was told they had ran out of the meat (it was 5 o""clock on a Sunday) so I decided to go for chicken... it had ONE texture; As if it came from a can. It was also cold. the toppings and their runny juices of veggies cascaded to the plate. The same story happened with the beef tacos. Cold and runny. The hamburger (yes; they speak hamburguesas too) was charred but almost raw inside. And cold. The server asked us how our food was. I aswered with a cold: ""interesting..."" He never bothered to ask as to what I meant. There were not desserts or coffee offered. Apparently not a place to linger. Our server passed us by and we asked for the bill. He immediately took it out of his pocket and placed it on our table. He was psychic enough to somehow know we would not want anything else. Ever. [REVIEW_14] half-price margarita pitchers on tuesday. i'm so there. the mahi mahi taco is calling my name. [REVIEW_15] Went to lunch at Tavern today 8/29/17 with three co-workers who had never been before on my recommendation. It was a huge mistake on my part. Tavern had been ok on previous visits but today a real disappointment. Slow and indifferent service. Hidden costs-charges for extra salsa on already over priced nachos. Ordered extra chicken on the nachos- it was not on the nachos when they arrived-we were still charged for them because Tavern brought us a plate of luke warm chicken to pour on after we'd already finished. We asked about the hidden cost of the chicken and salsa our server rolled her eyes and let us know she does not make the rules. This place is way overrated; over priced and the douche bag factor is off the charts. Fu*k Tavern. [REVIEW_16] Jon Butler was a pleasure to work with in buying a new mattress! Highly recommend going in to see him specifically. The store is clean and easy to navigate w a great selection! Jon made the whole process quick and easy which was important to me. Thank you Jon- I'll be back for sure! [REVIEW_17] Thoroughly displeased with Ray Brandts customer service. I was only able to get in touch with a person if I called before 8 am. (Business hours for service are 7 a.m. - 6 p.m.) I left voicemail's two days in a row; last week and this week; while no one attempted to contact me back. I was told my car would be looked at on Monday or first thing Tuesday morning. Left two voicemail's on Tuesday; no return call was made. I finally get in touch with someone on Wednesday and they have yet to look at my car. The appraisal states the work is to take 1 day to complete. They proceed to tell me it will be next week before I; might; have my car back. I get that hundreds of people had damage to their vehicles when my was damaged. However; this does not provide an excuse for poor customer service. I am spending a good deal of money and if no one wants to communicate with me there are multiple shops that want my money and will be more than happy to not only answer; but return my calls. (Ray Brandt returned 1 or my 7 calls over a week and a half) [REVIEW_18] Horrible food; the pork was under seasoned. The queso was watery. I will not return. [REVIEW_19] I love this place! This past summer; I would go here almost every other day to buy a different kind of donut for my family to try. The atmosphere is great; service is great; and the food is amazing. Not only are their donuts tasty as heck; but their sliders are to die for as well. If you are a donut fan or just a sweet-tooth; you got to try this place. NOTE: The food truck that you might see around town; IMO; does not have the same quality. Go to the location on Magazine St. [REVIEW_20] Ordered from grubhub waited an hour and a half for delivery so I called naturally no one picked up for another 20 minutes then when the guy answers his explanation was that they were on break and hadn't made my order yet and gave me the "" oh well"" attitude and didn't offer any kind of compensation. [REVIEW_21] Moved here from Baltimore last November and have had a hard time finding a good hairdresser.  Tried two other salons with disastrous results.  After reading the reviews on Yelp I decided to try Co. Capelli.  Jana happened to have an opening on the next Saturday; and knowing none of the stylists; I decided to give her a try.  She was great!  My haircut is one of the best ever.  She took time upfront to understand the style I was looking for and the type of hair I have and didn't rush through the cut.  She even gave me some styling tips that have my hair looking better than ever.  Thank you Jana!  i will be back soon. [REVIEW_22] Best breakfast on the beach!!! Diane; Renee and Paige are the best!! If you are looking from delicious food and great service; stop in!!! [REVIEW_23] Been here so many times before and all I can say is the food is really good. A hidden gem in Florissant; it has the best Panang curry around. Haven't been to their sister restaurant yet; but I can't seem to want to move on when I am always so satisfied with their fare here. [REVIEW_24] One of the worst service experience. I ordered egg roll and the pho. Egg rolls came out covered with burn crumbles all over and very drak color of the shell and you could the content pretty much black color as if it was almost burned or at the least fried in the last drop of over used burned oil and I could not posssibly put it in my mouth. When I was explaining that Im concerned things are too burned; the owner lady walked up and snatched the plate away from me without saying anything. I did not know if they ate bringing another one or not. Only after I grabbed my waiter later he said they are not making another one ans would take it off my check.  Absolutely rude; not communicating; disrespectful of their customers..  the only reason I came was because the neighboring miss saigoin restaurant was flooded but I think it's worth a wait compared to this place if I want to spend any money for pho and walk out feeling happy :( [REVIEW_25] So I went to this fine establishment yesterday after a night out on the town. Was looking for some quality pizza and possibly some wings. The wait was a little long but not terrible considering the night rush. I got a large pepperoni and a dozen wings with a side of hot sauce. Everything sounds great right? Pizza tastes good; wings taste good. Me being slightly... buzzed thought nothing of the bill... after all my main mission was to get Pizza. It wasn't until I collected myself this morning that I realized how ridiculous it was that I spent 32 bucks on a pep pizza and a dozen wings. I think you guys can do the math. I got fleeced in my moment of drunkin pizza need. Anyway; go next door. These guys can't operate like decent human beings. I'm sure the owner will read this so my message is: yeah we might be drunk when we order but we remember the next day and apparently this isn't an isolated event according to my friends. Deuces. (Drops mic) [REVIEW_26] This restaurant is delicious and has reasonable prices. We had a group of 12 and after being turned away by several places; jasmine rice accommodated the party in a short amount of time. Service was fast and friendly. We had a great experience here. [REVIEW_27] A 5 star review? I must be crazy right? Well; maybe but certainly not for giving this particular hotel 5 stars. I stayed at this location for one evening and while the building is older and not at all flashy the staff is really what made the stay a 5 star stay. I really have never dealt with such a friendly front desk staff both at check in and check out and to top it off I received a really delicious chocolate chunk cookie. Chocolate; friendly staff and super quiet/private room....just what I love and just what I needed. [REVIEW_28] Wouldn't go here again..... I got my belly button pierced...first off it was pierced crooked; secondly the artist was making really Inappropriate jokes the whole time... Not to mention the fact that he told me about one girl who he pierced who thought the pain was so bad she fainted...Like that's not something you should be talking to customers about as they are about to get their piercing.....NOT COOL! I also hated the fact that he bad mouthed other shops and tried saying that he was the best piercer ever because he's been doing it for this long and blah blah blah.... Sorry buddy but if you were the best my piercing wouldnt have been crooked...wouldn't recommend [REVIEW_29] Bomb food; especially for the price. The owners and workers are super nice. Overall great place; definitely check it out. [REVIEW_30] I am not from the area; but I do know good food when I have it and let me tell you; this was GOOD FOOD!!. Fried chicken; fried okra and squash casserole all done to perfection.  Dessert was a blackberry cobbler that was almost as good as grandma's (come on; no one beats grandma!); this was the best I have had since.  As we are staying in a hotel; we ordered food to go so that we could have it for brunch tomorrow; I am very excited to get to do it all over again!!  As to the service and the ambience; well; this is my kind of place; mismatched chairs and tables with no pretense at all. The servers are only happy if you are happy; it just doesn't get better than this!",15
93,"[REVIEW_1] This is by far the best pizza in the area.  Brick oven and very tasty.  We love getting the special sodas there as a extra treat.  Tony is so friendly.  We usually get take out or delivery.  I love this place! [REVIEW_2] My boyfriend and I came to Ybor city and stumbled upon this place. When we walked in; we noticed the Galaga/Ms Pacman table was just getting cleaned up. WHAT? So we sat there. He kicked my butt at Galaga and Ms Pacman; and I still love this place! Great live music. I would recommend just getting some mixed drinks (I had 2 Bombay Tonic; he had 1 Johnnie Walker black on the rocks) Bill was $25 before tip. Not bad considering the awesome live music and game table! The service was ok; not the best but not the worst. I see a lot of reviews of this place and it seems like some of the issues could be resolved if you order drinks like I recommend instead of the frozen drinks. Cheaper; enjoy the great music; and less of a hangover. Win/win/win? [REVIEW_3] If I could give zero stars I would. I never ever have had such an experience at an establishment. I came here with a group of 8 for a birthday dinner. We had more than 1 server. I have no idea what any of their names were. They give NO REFILLS on anything (soda; tea; lemonade; etc) which I think is insane! So they recommend buying a pitcher. The pitchers and ice bucket were both in plastic containers you can get from the dollar store.   We wait nearly 2 hours for our food. Majority of our party ordered mac & cheese as a side. Once we got our plates we noticed their was shrimp in our mac & cheese. When we questioned our server; she responded ""Oh I thought she told you we ran out"". Mind you; that is completely fine; but what if someone had a seafood allergy?   To top it off; 2 of our party members (birthday girl included) did not receive their meals. They didn't even check back at the table until we flagged them down to report the missing plates. Our server then responded; ""I honestly don't even know what you ordered"". We didn't even finish our food and the birthday girl didn't even want to eat them to even bother making her food since we had waited so long and they were closing. We asked to speak to a manager and was told they would come. When they didn't; we asked again. At this time; our ""server"" (the same one we asked to get a manager) claimed she was the manager. WHICH WE KNEW WAS A LIE.   I understand they have just opened but theres no way an establishment should be run this way. Our entrees came out on glass plates; but everything else was on paper plates.   I WOULD NOT recommend this establishment to anyone. They didn't apologize or seem interested in good customer service. [REVIEW_4] Featuring only Canadian ingredients (over 90% of which are sourced in Alberta and BC); the now 11 week old addition to Edmonton's growing 124 St was not far down on my list to eat. Our reservation was for 7pm last Saturday and when we arrived; it was surprisingly not fully seated! A long bar counter actually allows diners to show up without reservations; something I wish I would have known earlier. Large windows made it feel quite open and as the night went on; the dark interior gave it a very trendy atmosphere.  To start; I had my mind set on a Caesar; a truly Canadian drink. I didn't even bother to look at the drinks menu (whoops!) and when I ordered; our server Chris kindly told me they had removed it from the menu. Aperol Spritz then? North 53′s mixologist Brendan Brewster (formerly Woodwork; Manor Bistro); happily accommodated my off menu request.   Joe and I decided to order off the a la carte versus the $85 tasting meu (lowered from the original opening $100); although many tables were doing so. There's just something about being able to choose what to eat!  The ""Various Beets"" has been on the menu for some time now and that's always a sign that it's a winner. Indeed it was. Beets sourced from Riverbend Gardens; done in a multitude of ways: sorbet; pickled; and dehydrated meringue; layered with a goat's cheese mousse; red wine vinaigrette; candied walnuts; and nasturtium (a watercress-like leaf with a peppery taste). Best presentation ever. And incredibly delicious! The beet meringue was the most intriguing; dehydrated to the point that upon contact with moisture (your mouth); it almost dissolved into a burst of beet flavor. What just happened there?!  While I was pondering away on the use of a dehydrator; Joe was trying the duck rillette; which he chose from the menu. Similar to a pate; the Fourwhistle Farm's duck was cooked until tender; shredded and formed; topped with pieces of smoked duck breast; and cherry gelee. Gastriqued cherries along with a cherry and hazelnut puree decorated the rest of the plate. Joe loved the gastriqued cherries and both of us enjoyed the smoked duck breast. More of that; please!  Sauteed carrots came on top of pearl barley risotto; finished with the Cheesiry's pecorino stock; freshly shaved perocrino; and watercress. Sprinkled over top was a dehydrated brown butter powder; giving the dish another layer of seasoning.  The black cod; sourced from Vancouver Island; was done to perfection and supremely moist. Little neck clams and a clam froth were mixed in with the butternut squash puree and roasted butternut squash; although a different server (not Chris) said they were oysters when he brought it out. I really enjoyed this dish and it's because of dishes like these that I'm always keen on ordering a fish entree instead of another protein. I won't know how it compares to the wild boar or milk fed veal sirloin tip until my next visit!  I have learnt that two desserts will always make me happier than one and seeing that we were both 80% full; why not. Chris highly recommended the sunchoke ice cream. This dish is definitely not to be missed! Aside from the creative use of sunchoke; it was placed on a thyme sponge; layered with balsamic vinegar curd and more of the brown butter powder; this time with black malt. The ice cream was very well done; smooth; no crystals of ice and had such a pleasant flavor. The thyme sponge had a... spongey texture. Honestly one of the most interesting things to eat; next to the beet meringue we had earlier. Really starting to wonder what kind of dehydrator they're using back there!  Our second dessert was the wild blueberry sorbet; accompanying a goat's milk panna cotta. On the bottom were dried blueberries; roasted rolled oats; and a blueberry tuile to anchor the dish. All components were gorgeous; and overall the dish was very unsweetened; which can be a nice way to end a meal. The tarragon granite might not be for all; especially if you do not enjoy licorice! I didn't even know tarragon had that natural taste; it's always mixed in with other herbs when I've had it.  Overall; the meal was one of the best that I've ever had. Points all around for presentation; creativity; and taste! It's like an episode on the Food Network. Not only that; the service was excellent and the kitchen was timely with our plates. Chris was extremely knowledgeable on the menu and its ingredients. I had read from some diners that the atmosphere was quite formal; but not so when we went. Quite relaxed in my opinion but they may have eased up; much like the cost of the plates. [REVIEW_5] this place is amazing.  i don't get cravings for italian food a lot; but MAN! their meatball sub is heaven... like i want one now... right now... not kidding...  their food is always so fresh and you can taste it. at first i saw their portions and was all ""this is not enough to be called italian"" but half way through you're waving the white flag... but then the food is so nommy you just don't want to stop. and you finally do when you've used the last of their amazing bread to lap up the last drops of sauce... THAT'S ITALIAN!  i never make it to gelato; but the one time i tried some from a friend he ordered ""chocolate covered bacon"" and the base flavor was smooth and delicious; the chocolate covered bacon part started off good... tasted like toffee... then this hickory smoked flavor comes in from left field... needless to say... i'll be getting my own flavors [REVIEW_6] So glad to have this addition to our local restaurant scene. They always have fresh fish; never frozen. Nice and courteous staff; and a clean place. Keep it up Joe. [REVIEW_7] It's like they have the blind leading the blind here. We ordered a deluxe pizza and when we opened the box; ALL of the cheese and toppings had slid off the pizza and into the corner of the box. It was as if he carried the pizza vertically. We actually laughed out loud when we saw it. Plus our roast beef sammy was way overcooked and dry... and missing the ""everything"" we asked for (lettuce; onion; pickle; tomato; mayo).  So we called back and explained the situation and they promised to send the remake out RIGHT AWAY. lol.... another hour later we got a nice looking roast beef sammy but a pizza that was even MORE jacked! There was not a single topping even hinged on the the crust of the pizza.  We called back again laughing. I said; ""I am not even mad; I am impressed. Let me send you a text image of this pizza- it is crazy."" He apologized profusely and promised to send another; but at this point it had been 2 hours and we had drank our sodas; and eaten our wings and had dinner plans so we refused another pizza.   At this point; the gentleman offered to bring us back our ten dolllars for the pizza and we accepted. He said he'd be by shortly but it was another hour before we saw him.  Total s-show. Avoid this location altogether. I have had far superior service at the U City or Maplewood locations. YIKES [REVIEW_8] Do yourself a favor and order up a beef gyro platter. It comes with so much food you could probably feed two; but you're going to want to hoard it all for yourself. Plus you get enough hummus and pita to bath in -- win win. [REVIEW_9] The price point is amazing. The size of the plates are just right! We had the squash dumplings; brisket slider; collard greens; and hot chicken - all worth trying. Loved the Mobile Mule cocktail. [REVIEW_10] Extremely slow.  I have been here since 8:00 am...it's now 8:29 am.  The lobby has four people left and started with six.  Only two people have been helped.  One person checks in patients and draws blood. [REVIEW_11] Local ice cream stand in business for over 55 years. Homemade ice cream; amazing milkshakes and chili cheese dogs are must try items on the menu. Bring cash; they don't accept plastic. [REVIEW_12] I've been to Baileys Range three times and each time I leave happy and fully satisfied! The food is amazing and the drinks are different and delicious!  The food: the burgers are constantly changing but they always offer something that you'll like. I always go for anything with guacamole and cheese :) oh and the fries; oh wow! So good!! They have several different dipping sauces which is really nice!  The drinks: they have awesome pitchers for a great deal of their lemonades. Boozy lemonade? Who doesn't want booze in their lemonade? The ambiance: the layout is super fun with upstairs and downstairs seating.   Definitely check them out for your burger and fry fix :) [REVIEW_13] It may be in the back of a best western but it has carefully selected beer; games and BBQ that was 1000 times our expectation. Awesome! [REVIEW_14] Great food! We have eaten here many times and had filet; salmon; crab cakes and pasta dishes and everything is fabulous! They also have a great selection of local brewery's such as Flying Fish and Cape May brewery. We highly recommend this restaurant. [REVIEW_15] Recently had a horrible experience here. Service- We were seated at a table to which none of the servers were apparently assigned. Everyone just kept walking by our table and ignored us. After 15 min; my husband flagged someone down.  Host came over; apologized and got our drinks.   Food- Definitely not worth the ridiculous prices.  My shrimp cocktail was so tough I couldn't chew it.  Scallops were ok but definitely not the best I ever had and not at all worth the price $32.  It was served with some watery cauliflower that they called ""puréed.""  My husbands $42 filet mignon was a piece of tasteless; stringy meat.  Host asked how our food was and he agreed that the meat looked stringy and explained that he appreciated the feedback because they are trying a new meat provider""!!  Offered to get something else but we declined. Just wanted to get out. We were offered free dessert.  Ambience- sounded like we were eating in the casino game area.  Noisy. Very bright lighting.  One of the ceiling recessed lights was shining directly on me like a spotlight. I actually brought it to our waiters attention and asked if they could be turned down.  He simply said no and walked away. Furnishings look so dated including the fake fish tank on the big ""gold"" wall!  Will not return. For those kind of prices there are soooo many better restaurants. [REVIEW_16] I'm in the Clearwater area quite often for business so I'm always looking for good restaurants. Cafe Ponte was a recommendation from the customer who was joining us for dinner and it did not disappoint. The lobster bisque was excellent with just a hint of habanero. Something unique that I was not expecting. I had the Boullibaisse which was loaded with seafood in a rich broth. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town. [REVIEW_17] These are the very best pancakes I've ever had. My wife too and our 3 year old son too! We got there very early and it was still busy but when we left; the live went around the block. Normally I would criticize people for waiting that long to eat but I was actually thinking about getting back in line!!   This place will ALWAYS be on our list of MUST GO places whenever we are in Nashville. [REVIEW_18] Place is a bit run down. Office staff are not knowledgeable or helpful. They act like they don't have time to answer questions and absolutely are clueless on what is happening in the complex. We only paid for one semester (overpriced) and regretted not just finding off campus housing. I would never recommend this place. It is NOT worth the money or the headaches. [REVIEW_19] Went here a few weeks ago for contacts. I had previously gotten an eye exam at another place but they were way too expensive when it came to ordering contacts. Saw this place while shopping at the plaza and decided to check it out. I was greeted right away by the receptionist. I was helped by an associate named Paige who made the transition of my records very smooth without hassle. I was looking to try out new colored contacts and Paige was very patient with me as I tried nearly all the colors they had to offer!  Despite me trying all of the different colors; the associate worked efficiently that the whole appointment lasted less than 30 minutes.  Also; they told me it would take 3-5 business days for my contacts to come in and it came in 2! Will definitely come back for my next contact order. [REVIEW_20] Yummy food;  they will veganize things for you as well. The servers are friendly and the restaurant is spacious and has a bar and a stage area. We have had our work Holiday party here for the past couple years; both parties turned out great. The guacamole is awesome! [REVIEW_21] Food is good; however if your attitude stinks I refuse to give you a good review. We've been here before while visiting PHilly we were in Delaware and decided to drive to Philly. Only to be greeted by someone who appeared to be having a bad start to the new year. Hope you have a great new year. [REVIEW_22] What a treat!  Unplugged brings a great wine bar to downtown Tucson.  I've been here multiple times; and I love the wine selection they have.  The ambiance is beautiful; and the bites are delicious!  I could go on ranting about how great it is; but you'll have to try for yourself! [REVIEW_23] Drove past this place recently and I think it's closed .;.............................................................................. ..............................................;........................... [REVIEW_24] OMG the Buffalo tails must be made with Crack! !! I can't stop eating them!  Seriously;  with the light flour dusting these are perfect. Got with mild - super tasty and a side of hot for those more adventurous in our group. 50 tails for our family of 3 lasts about 3 days! [REVIEW_25] Daniel and Ben exceeded my expectations with their level of dedication and professionalism in helping me get the heat working at my house during the frigid cold blast we had last week. Before swapping parts out and increasing the repair cost; they were able to fix the wiring on the unit and saved me a lot of money. I would recommend them to anyone looking for fair; honest service. Much appreciated guys!!! [REVIEW_26] Always consistantly great for breakfast.  Delicious beignets; great eggs.  Try the city grits! [REVIEW_27] Service is terrible; food is ok; location is great (which is why the average yelp review is currently hanging to a mediocre 3 stars).   I've been here many times. It's always about the same. Very convenient; as it's located in Jackson Square. The open window seating is great.   The food is ok; not great; but edible.  The service is where the place needs serious help. One example: I sat at a table (this is a seat yourself type of place); and the table wasn't yet cleaned. The bus boy (old man) was rude about the situation and yelled ""you need to get up and move so I can clean the water on the floor!""  Umm; ok? Maybe you should have a better system for cleaning tables? Or realize that the whole city is a little dirty and a little water on the floor would have gone unnoticed?   Overall; management is the problem. No standard protocol; and not much training for their workers. [REVIEW_28] Never thought I could sit down at a place like this do work and homework and enjoy a coffee. But this place is amazing. Great to do business and school assignments and enjoy it. Service is great; always seems like they are in a great mood. Still haven't tried the salads but have had every sandwich and they are delicious. [REVIEW_29] Inedible & FDA Beware!   Le Saigon wins the #1 prize of being the most inconsiderate; rude; and unsafe restaurant on the main line.  The produce; meats; and other ingredients used by the owner of Le Saigon is cheap; expired; and extremely unsafe.  The food is horribly prepared and lacks any flavor.    The service is rude.  I bet you Le Saigon will have the same fate at Yangming; that is; it will be shut down by the FDA.    An embarrassment to the Main Line restaurants. [REVIEW_30] Best wax I've ever had. Was kept distracted and entertained the whole time; which was actually insanely quick. The woman makes her own natural wax out of honey; which is really cool and she even gave me a free arm pit wax for being a first time customer. The salon is hard to find but once you do it is the best! It's in a kind of unmarked building then you go in and take the elevator to the second floor and walk down the hallway past a few other business.",21
94,"[REVIEW_1] Great job on my fill and gel pedicure. Even though it was close to closing; they took their time and even accommodated every request I had (I'm VERY particular). Clean environment and very friendly staff. Way more than I could have expected for a nail salon in a mall. P.S. My foot and hand massages afterwards were heavenly. I will DEFINITELY be back!!! [REVIEW_2] I'm not sure why I'm writing this since you can just look at every other review written for this place and get the exact same story.   My wife was literally grabbed; like actually literally grabbed; by the face the second she stepped in the door. The culprit was a big-tittied shot girl that proceeded to dump a bunch of piss water down her throat. Then I was informed I owed her $24. When I refused to pay I was told the police were being called. My wife; not wanting to spend our trip coming to pick me up at the police station; (which is where I gladly would have gone rather than give a penny to these shady-ass MFers); swiped my wallet from my pocket and paid the bill.   Everybody there from the door guys to the managers to the bathroom attendants are the worst; most sketchy people on Bourbon Street. If you gave this place a five-star review please do humanity a favor and shoot yourself in the face. [REVIEW_3] We loved it there. Went Saturday night with 3 people and even though WE messed up the reservation (we only said it was 2 not 3 of us) they accommodated us right away. The food was delicious and even though we were the last guests after a while they didn't try to get us out but chatted with us. Great service; great food; perfect I say! If George is around you are in great hands [REVIEW_4] I love coming here! Food is great and the service is what I'd expect coming to an lower-end Indian restaurant. The portions are so large I always have enough for 2-3 meals after! [REVIEW_5] Beware of smiling Joe! We bought living room furniture from him. We trusted him. He told us that once furniture was delivered it would be harder to return; however; he didn't say it couldn't be returned--just harder. When I called to tell Joe two of the furniture pieces weren't going to fit and we needed to exchange; he said ""oh; let me talk to customer service and call you back."" I let two days pass and called him back since he didn't return my call. The person that answered phone asked if they could give Joe a message; I said yes; that they could tell him I wanted him to call me back like he said he was going to do. Within 2 minutes my phone was ringing; but it wasn't Joe. I think she said her name was Madilyn; not sure. She said that she was just calling to tell me there are no returns or exchanges. I told her that Joe had said it was hard and the paperwork just says Ashley reserves the right to refuse returns but it doesn't say they won't. She proceeded to rudely and condescending ly say that she could read the paper to me. I told her thanks but I know how to read.   It's sad that some Ashley employees in Clearwater Florida are rude and intentionally mislead what would have been ongoing customers. Our home is new and we need more furniture. However; we will now look for a more reputable company to give our money to. Hope it was worth it smiling Joe and condescending customer service person [REVIEW_6] One of the worst service experience. I ordered egg roll and the pho. Egg rolls came out covered with burn crumbles all over and very drak color of the shell and you could the content pretty much black color as if it was almost burned or at the least fried in the last drop of over used burned oil and I could not posssibly put it in my mouth. When I was explaining that Im concerned things are too burned; the owner lady walked up and snatched the plate away from me without saying anything. I did not know if they ate bringing another one or not. Only after I grabbed my waiter later he said they are not making another one ans would take it off my check.  Absolutely rude; not communicating; disrespectful of their customers..  the only reason I came was because the neighboring miss saigoin restaurant was flooded but I think it's worth a wait compared to this place if I want to spend any money for pho and walk out feeling happy :( [REVIEW_7] I've been to Nordstrom before but this was my first time at this store inside the mall. Very clean inside; lots of varieties to choose from. The men's jeans are very costly so you should take advantage of whatever sales that they have. They got some good cologne for men and women. [REVIEW_8] Jessica C. was Super Helpful; it's a Huge & Busy Store;  i can't even tell how much she helped this newbie on the South East corner across from the Speedwasy Shopping Mall; across the street from Marsh & also directly across from KFC [REVIEW_9] Its an awesome place for a vegetarian person; staff is friendly and food quality is also good! Must go [REVIEW_10] OMG!  This is by far the worst Thai food I have ever eaten.  The food was bland; and seemed reheated in a microwave.  The restaurant had an odd odor; the bathrooms were dirty; the phone rang extremely loud during our entire dinner; the service was slow and the employees were less than attentive and not very friendly.  In addition; I left my Maui Jim sunglasses there and called to see if they could mail (i'd pay for any mailing cost) them to me since I live out of state. they stated they were too busy and didn't have time EVER to mail them.... [REVIEW_11] Staffed exclusively by apathetic; dull-witted employees committed to helping you as little as is humanly possible. First one I asked for help wasn't even aware the business had closed 15 minutes before; which would have saved me some time; the second replied to a question about whether there were any other open car washes close by with ""Do you know how to work GPS on your phone?"" Absolute waste of time. [REVIEW_12] The food was excellent even the beans and rice taste great. The chicken enchiladas are amazing. The prices aren't bad and the service was good. [REVIEW_13] Great food good times if your looking  for a great time this is the place hands down the staff are professional and always taking care of their customers tell unsweetened tea comes in a huge glass and the food comes in huge portions the customers are nice and will hold a great conversation with you as well. [REVIEW_14] This is the worst restaurant that I have ever been to. Service is poor. Food is soso. We have to go to another restaurant afterwards to get some real food. I will never come again. I would not recommend it to any of my friends. [REVIEW_15] Simply the best frozen custard you will ever have in the city. Do not come to St Louis; MO and not try this gem. [REVIEW_16] Pros: I was able to make a sameday appointment for both my sister and myself. The woman running the front desk was very welcoming and was expecting us. I had told her on the phone that I wanted a strong deep tissue massage and she hooked me up with a really fabulous young woman. It was one of the best massages I've ever had. I really liked that she asked me what I wanted. She tailored the massage to my needs (neck and shoulders) rather than going through the motions and doing my whole body. My sister and I had massages in the same room at the same time; and it was nice that we could do that.   Cons (I'm extremely picky and mostly pointing this out to help Massage Envy; not to dissuade): I did not love how the receptionists are at the front desk loudly making confirmation calls while you're sitting waiting for the massage therapist. But My sister wasn't as thrilled by her massage person. There were only enough hooks for one person's stuff in our double room.Our therapists chatted amongst themselves a bit more than we would have preferred.   Overall; highly recommended! I am a member; so I can get my massages at the local member price; which in Tampa is pretty low. It's a bargain for a lovely service! [REVIEW_17] Tried this place out this morning due to the relatively cheap price and good reviews and I was VERY disappointed. I swear my spicy tuna roll was warm and nobody wants room temperature raw fish! The mussels were dried out and tiny and 90% of the rolls on the menu have cream cheese so there's not much variety. I had two rolls and just left rather than continue eating there and will not be returning when there are so many other good sushi options in Reno.  I will saw however that the staff was very friendly; and I don't think it was the staffs fault as much as it as the obviously low quality ingredients. [REVIEW_18] One recommendation: STAY AWAY FROM THE MARGARITAS!  For $5.00; you get a small cup of artificially flavored; watered down liquid that reminds me of the restaurant cocktail mix bottles sold at Bed Bath & Beyond.  A Mexican establishment; with a bar and expansive drink selection; should always serve decent margaritas - no exceptions.  And the service was just as awful.  Our waitress didn't fill up our water glasses once in the 3 hours we were there; and for our table of 4; she repeatedly got our drinks wrong (but because it took forever to get them; it wasn't worth asking her to correct the orders).   For the same price; I can go to Bakersfield and drink freshly squeeze lime juice with premium; smooth tequila; and it comes in a substantially larger size.  So you can guess where I will be the next time I have a hankering for margs... [REVIEW_19] Food is delicious; staff is great. Love the lettuce wraps! All the food is worth the price. Good for takeout and dine in. My ultimate favorite restaurant. [REVIEW_20] In and Out is the worst neighborhood take out place in West Oak Lane. I ordered breakfast (I know lol) from them about a month ago; and received pancakes that were drenched in some weird butter substance and home fries that were rock hard. I spoke to a man named Tommy; who offered all kinds of excuses about the food before finally offering me a credit.   Fast forward to this morning. I decided to give them another chance because I was hungry and had a credit. I call and am greeted by a young woman who informed me that I had two people waiting before me and asked me to hold. She proceeded to place me on hold before I could even respond. I held for about 3 minutes before she picked up. I placed my order and then explained that I had a credit. She stated she would need to look in ""the book"" for my credit. Another two minutes of waiting and surprise; she can't locate my credit. I ask to speak to a manager; and she says that the manager is out doing deliveries. Seriously...wth? She tells me I can call back later. Umm no; I'm hungry now.  I ended up canceling my order. This place is beyond ratchet and I will never order from them again. The food at Bruno's and Bally's is much better...so is their level of cleanliness and customer service. [REVIEW_21] Hidden Gem! Great outdoor patio for spending a relaxing afternoon or evening in New Orleans! We missed the live music but loved the wine and the shop for your own meat and cheese board! [REVIEW_22] I ordered the shaved zucchini salad- it had a blue cheese yogurt; candied beets; pistachios (I think?) and some greens. Kind of small for $12; but it was good!  Also had the beausoleil oyster with chopped cucumber and some kind of mignette- delightful and you can buy them individually so you don't have to get a full order like many places!  The rose sour cocktail was right up my alley- slightly sweet and made with bubbles- how could I not like it?  We also ordered the sorghum bacon- thick cut like pork belly- sweet sauce! Yummy!   I really LOVE LOVE LOVE the decor and atmosphere here; eclectic industrial and slightly vintage- so super cute!    The menu changes quite frequently so be sure to check back often! [REVIEW_23] The guy checking you out is horrible.  He seemed high to me. It took almost 20 minutes to get through the 'exit' gate.  When I went to return the car I was distracted and forgot to fill it. I asked the attendant where I could go; and he was helpful.. AS I went to leave; I told the gate guy (ironically the same one) what the attendant told me to say. I have a contract that started last Sunday; and I just need to head out to refuel. The guy gave me deer in headlights; and said... ""what do you mean re-fuel"".  I said; I forgot.... and need to fill the car  up before I turn it in.""  -What do you mean fill it up?   Do you have a contact.... then 5 minutes......... Really [REVIEW_24] Always love going to Whirled Peace! They have a nice rotation of 10-12 flavors and all the fixins. I go there about once a week and have been doing so for months (even in the cold). Great place to get some reasonably priced frozen yogurt! [REVIEW_25] Ivy is the best! I'm a male and Ivy is always up-to-date with the latest trends and hair for men. She's very talented; and if you show her a picture of the hairstyle you want; she will replicate it. Super friendly and nice; if you are a guy in the Uptown area looking for an awesome and trendy haircut/style; go to John Jay and ask for Ivy! [REVIEW_26] I went to LA smoke on Thursday afternoon we had to poke rib coleslaw and fries when the rib came out the first time they was Cold send them back they came out hot but they tasted horrible [REVIEW_27] They've yet to get even my most basic of orders right (iced black coffee); and when I do order specialty coffees; they suck. I ask for extra espresso every time and even though they'll charge me for it; they rarely add it. Specialty Lattes? They'll taste like mostly milk. Service is also mediocre. They will give me the correct drink if I drive back; but who wants to have to drive back every time? Not to mention it comes with a side of attitude.   Whoever is running this place; please get it together. [REVIEW_28] Don't do business with this ""company"".  They don't respond to emails or phone calls. In fact; they don't even have a voicemail set up so it just rings to no avail. I ordered a product along with 2 day shipping.  I waited the 2-3 days processing time and emailed to inquire for tracking number. Nothing. Called over and over. For an establishment that sets such strict guidelines on no refunds; high restocking fees and also threatens they will seek monetary damages if you file a pay pal claim; you would think they would follow their own rules.  As soon as I filed a claim with PayPal they responded and refunded my money. How difficult is it to communicate with your customer?  It's a fraudulent business in my opinion and PayPal should discontinue doing business with them. [REVIEW_29] I was so disappointed when this opened; I was hoping for Nashville's first real authentic Greek restaurant (Athens notwithstanding).  This isn't Greek; it isn't even Mediterranean. It's pseudo-Americanized versions of Mediterranean classic cuisine. The corporate chefs got so many things wrong:  Skordalia is a classic Greek dip made out of potatoes and garlic (not bread).  Avgolemono is chicken soup with egg; lemon and rice -- not this thin; awful broth they are currently serving. If one wants true Greek cooking; one should go to Greektown in either Detroit or Toronto.  Just say no. [REVIEW_30] This is my ultimate favorite pizza place ever! I have wonderful family memories of going here with my grandmom and the whole family. They have the best pizza ever and very yummy cheese fries. No matter what you get the food is always wonderful! I went to the 60th anniversary celebration recently and it was great fun! I will never tire of this place. It's a great place to go with friends and I always recommend it to new people. I just love it so much.",16
95,"[REVIEW_1] Stopped in to Aldine on Friday night for a post-dinner drink and ended up getting a preview of some items that are now on the tasting menu. Atmosphere is minimalist romantic. Drinks were superb - interesting concoctions that actually were coherent (unlike other high end mixology-based bars in Philly). Smoked scallop was perfection; and the garnishes (fennel cracker? YES PLEASE) were creative and well executed. The carrot cake???  Delicious! Also got to try the butter sundae and chocolate mousse; both were excellent. Chef George (and his entire staff) was gracious; informative; and clearly is cooking at the top of his game. Just GO; order the tasting menu; and enjoy! I will be back soon and often. [REVIEW_2] Super fast delivery. We order at least once a week and it takes 15 minutes. I like that you can get any sandwich as an unwich. Love the pickles and that they quarter them. [REVIEW_3] Excellent restaurant & service. Very nice atmosphere & friendly staff. I have tried the pizza & the calzone. Really nice and I loved it. [REVIEW_4] Awful! Typical Philly ""hot spot"" that appeals to hipsters and snobs that would rather have a ""scene"" than quality dining. We ordered several pizzas. They were thin with burnt crust and room temperature. Worst of all they were $15-16 a pop! Insane. I could stay in the suburbs and go to a mom & pop joint where real unpretentious folks go and get a pizza ten-times as good for half the cost!  Plastic chairs and little to no atmosphere. The service wasn't bad and that was the high point! I hate that places like this can actually be successful. A total half-assed effort catered to mindless hipsters and wannabes that think it's cool to do the Philly thing for a few years. Real Philly people know where to get Pizza and Vetri ain't it! [REVIEW_5] horrible. in Everyway. coffee and food taste horrible. horrible service too. Hat trick of horrible. NO STARS. [REVIEW_6] Our new favorite for Asian cuisine take out! Finally I don't feel greasy and heavy after eating. Food tastes fresh and prepared so well. The crab Rangoon is the best I've found since I lived in the city. Highly recommend this place. [REVIEW_7] These guys are hands-down the best customer service I've had in 15 years of owning a car. They genuinely care about helping you out; always polite; always willing to accommodate you and they don't overcharge. I recommend them to ALL my friends! [REVIEW_8] Food is bomb.  Plus good servers.  Right by river.  You have nothing to lose and everything to gain by eating here. [REVIEW_9] Yelped this place and when we arrived the line was out the door towards the back of building. Was almost discouraged to stop but I read other Yelpers say it moves fast...in which it did and so well worth the wait. I absolutely love this place. The service is great and Katryn took my order giving me the best suggestions since I had no clue what to order; delivered my food; cleaned tables & fountain machine; and ensured customers were good and always asked us all if we needed anything. She works hard and was so kind and receptive to customers. The atmosphere was nice and Blues theme and music was playing. It was small and claustrophobic inside so we sat outside. No music on the outside though. I absolutely love this place and will make sure I visit it every time I'm in St. Louis. I'm not big in sandwiches so me giving this place 5 stars is really saying something. Great place !!! Finally a place in St. Louis I like over what we have in a Florida. I've dined at so many of the 4-5 star places around here and have not been this impressed.   I'm sure all the sandwiches are good. I ordered 7th Street Sicilian; Big Tommy (ask for Au Jus to dip) & Prez Reuben...all delicious!! Crushed Ice for fountain drink was awesome (see pic)!! [REVIEW_10] Was wandering the streets of Philly and came across this restaurant.  Realizing I hadn't eaten all day I stopped off to grab a sandwich.  I immediately fell in love with the atmosphere and the staff was amazing and friendly.    Sitting alone enjoying the view; a glass of proseco; and my amazing turkey sandwich; the staff checked in and offered light banter.    Very impressed and highly recommend. [REVIEW_11] Best tacos in SB!  Front counter guy always pleasant and friendly too. Love this place. [REVIEW_12] The burgers are fresh and delicious. Great sports bar on bourbon st.  I would definitely recommend this place if your looking for a good burger!!!!! [REVIEW_13] The sizes and flavor of the endless sushi rolls are perfect. I got a Rainbow Roll; Rock & Roll; & some nigiri on top of miso soup & gyoza. The only thing mediocre was the gyoza; but the amazing service; great wine choices; and fresh fish make up for that. If I lived here I would come here 3 times a week! It's not every day you have great food; reasonable prices; & amazing service. [REVIEW_14] We made it to the friendship gate; and I really just can't wait;  I found out that thing was sushi and not fishing bait; come to shop or if you're out on a date;  Don't be late to the Chinatown friendship gate [REVIEW_15] I am not sure they deserve one star..but they do not deserve two. Went this afternoon shortly after lunchtime. Walked in and was seated with my girl near the buffet. We discussed eating from it...but decided against it. I haven't been to a CM since the one left the Foothills mall many years ago....I never had any issue with anything at that location. The one on Campbell was not good. Server was polite; but when she came and gave us silverware...it was as if she was playing tiddlywinks...I was a bit perplexed when my three pieces were laid down knife....spoon over knife at a 45 degree angle; then the fork over top the same way...about 6 inches from my napkin. I hadn't thought about it until now...but I feel she was trying in code to tell me not to eat there. Yeah....that has to be it. I looked at the fork...and it looked as if it was taken from the table behind us....as they were using it....it was replaced with a clean one....I am hoping it was anyways...at least there was nothing on it that I could see...and that is 90% of the battle. On to the food. I ordered a chorizo burro. $9.00. This was the driest chorizo I have ever eaten....as my girth with attest.....I have had much chorizo in my life. About three hours after.....I feel yucky. Anyways.....I will not be returning here. [REVIEW_16] Dr. Todd is the best! I started going here about three months ago and I have noticed such a big difference.   I had broken my back in two places and have suffered from back pain for years. After seeing Dr. Todd I have noticed a difference in my flexibility and have not had the aching pain that I have dealt with on a daily basis. Dr. Todd is super friendly and truly listens to what is going on with YOU!   He is very flexible with scheduling and their prices are so reasonable. I have recommended him to many friends and family. He has truly made a big difference in my life and I am grateful!!! [REVIEW_17] This place is the best.. Bob Diehl is a straight forward honest man.  He has past his talent and character on to his sons.   He has done B service on my 430S and taken care of a broken gear shift. They get things done as promised; quickly and correctly for 1/2 the price.. I have referred two other Mercedes owners to Bob and they called to thank me for the introduction to Bob and the Stuttgart Autohaus.   Mike [REVIEW_18] What a great place for beers and a match! Plentiful selection of beers on tap. Didn't try the food; but it looked delicious.  The best part - never miss a second of the match since there's TVs in the restroom! [REVIEW_19] I have curly hair and spent too much time with stylists who cut my hair poorly.  I've found found a place which not only makes my hair bounce and flow but also does wonderful color and highlights.  As another reviewer noted; they are Deva cut professionals and are trained to cut curly hair. The work is thoughtful; thorough; and artful-I get compliments on both my color and cut. The salon is comfortable and homey; it lacks that ostentatious attitude that most salons project. The pricing is reasonable and fair--especially compared with other Main Line and Center City salons. [REVIEW_20] Over priced.  Over rated.  Totally disappointing.  No jelly donuts.  How can any self respecting donut place not have a jelly donut? Luckily the coffee was decent. [REVIEW_21] I had not visited Perlis in over thirty years and I now remember why.   My mother used to bring me there when I was growing up. My relatives shopped there too ; it was THE place that all of the old well to do familys of New Orleans went.       As a child ; I never noticed the rudeness ; I guess because it was my mom who had to work with the attendants while I sat board.   At twenty three ; I had not yet purchased my own suits ; and was still wearing the ones my mother had bought for me in my early years.    As a Twenty two year old I was a little intimidated as I walked in and saw the well dressed ; sofisticated attendants . I remember receiving glares and a very rude ; sarcastic  "" may I help you  "" from what appeared to be the man in charge at the time.   The rest of the visit didn't get any better. The attendant had a rude arrogance about him ; as though he was doing me a favor even speaking to me .  He obviously did not remember me from the last ten years of business that my mother had given them ; or maybe he did and just didn't care .  I suppose that having established themselves as THE place to buy clothing ; they had developed an attitude of superiority ; but to what ; or who ? These guys sell clothes for gods sake ; who are they superior to ?      This attitude has NOT changed.     A month ago ; I decided to see if a quarter century had brought about anything positive in the way of attitude.  My treatment was no different from that of my visit in 1982.  One of my attendants ( the head guy that day)  ; had the same arrogance as I remembered from years past.  His desire was to put me in what HE thought was best and displayed a sneer at my taste ; ( wich is quite conservative in nature and right up their alley ).     I ended up getting three pairs of pants ; one of which needed to be left for tailoring. I was told that I would be called when they were ready.     Four weeks had gone by with no call ; so I called them.  The mans tone on the end of the line was one of a person insulted . It seems that I was the one in error for having waited that long before calling ; and my tardiness was the insult.  How dare I suggest that Perlis would not have the work done in a week!!!    "" We always do "" ; he said.  "" May I ask who your attendant was  "" ?   ""  I don't remember "" I replied .            Then  ; with a VERY sarcastic  "" we'll do you remember the color  ; sir "" ?  ; with the sarcastic emphasis on sir.    "" I really don't ; it was a moth ago  ; and I bought them purely on a whim "" ; I replied .     "" Well wait just a minute SIR and I'll go look"" .      It was then that ; wether by mistake or on purpose ;  I heard him say as the phone left his ear for the counter  ; "" STUPID IDIOT "" !!                It was 30 minutes later that went through the door of Perlis for the last time.   There to greet me with same snied. ; "" may I help you sir "" ;  was the man I had spoken with on the phone. In my minds eye ;  I was expecting to see someone like those who I had seen the month before ; someone about 45 ; dressed to the old New Orleans nines ; but to my surprise it was a much older fellow ; short in stature ; and wearing a suit that I can only describe as strangely old fashioned ; like something the duke of Windsor might have worn in 1968.  It's funny ; I remember a picture from my childhood of a chimpanzee in a plaid suit very similar to the one he was wearing.  The picture was a spoof of a used car salesman if I recall.      While handing me the trousers he said ; in his now standard ; and rather lyrical sarcastic tone ; "" come again SIR ""  .   Not wanting confrontation ; I muttered ; "" not likely "" as I left their store for good.       I really don't know where these guys get off acting this way!?  Is business so good that they can treat customers with such disrespect and still gain new customers over the years?  That just doesn't add up.  I am sure I can't be alone in my experience. I wonder how many hundreds of thousands of dollars thes strangely arrogant people have lost over the decades by insulting customers this way?      Old man Perlis had better take heed of the fact that anyone can get anything in his store over the internet ; and for less. [REVIEW_22] Love this place. So far I've had three different barbers and each cut has been perfect. Never used a legit barber shop before and i couldn't be happier to have switched. The fades are tight; love the shape up; barbers are all cool; good barber shop talk; sports on tv; and not too pricey. Who could complain? I usually go mid day during the week; so not sure about normal wait times; but I've never had to wait. Great place. [REVIEW_23] This restaurant could NOT get any more delicious!!!! We had a party of 4 and were able to walk in at 7pm on a Wednesday - but by about 7:30pm it was PACKED!  Our waitress was an absolute delight and she explained everything from cocktails to dessert so effectively; we were excited to start! We ordered IPAs and an imaginary friend which were both excellent and the perfect drinks to begin the meal.  We ordered the 3 cheeses; all paired with their own jam.  The cheddar cheese with the apple butter is to die for.  We also ordered the bacon fat cornbread for an appetizer and let me tell you; this thing was simply delicious.  We basically licked the skilled clean.  We also all shared a beet salad and the roasted cauliflower - excellent even after the gluttonous cornbread!  The main dishes we had were the pork with bacon fried rice; the pork steak and the burger.  Every single bite we took was followed by a ""MMMMMM!"" or a ""OMG how can all these taste this good!"".  I loved the flavor of the burger with the peppers and cheddar cheese and the french fries with homemade ketchup/mayonnaise and my husband could not stop eating the bacon fried rice! The dessert we got for a birthday at our table was the apple crumble with ginger ice cream.....holy delicious!!! The ginger ice cream is the star with delicious salty; sugary apple and crumbles!  I am so happy to welcome Reeds to Maplewood! We will absolutely be returning and telling all of our foodie friends to check them out! [REVIEW_24] Ignorant bartender. Took forever for him to wait on you at a table on a Sunday afternoon; not even during football season.  Lesson learned. Never have a bartender wait on you for food.  Number 1; they don't want to do it; but also; they don't know the menu or anything about the kitchen when you ask a question. This is a typical suburban blue collar and millennial underwhelming establishment to watch Sports in with a pint of flat Budweiser. It is perfect for blue collars who swear that walk in dressed like they just finished a 10 hr day either painting; fixing drains; or laying down planks; or up on a roof. After 10 or 11pm the DB millennials roll in; espec on weekends. [REVIEW_25] I must have been unconscious because I stood in some kind of a line for several hours for nothing... not only was it terrible but it was also the most unorganized mess I have ever seen in my life. Save your money and time buy beer instead [REVIEW_26] Completed a state inspection with very short notice. Very professional and had me back on the road within an hour! Also gave me an Angie's List discount!! [REVIEW_27] I eat here everytime I'm in New Orleans and always recommend it to friends. I can't vouch for their more lunch-y items but their brunch/breakfast stuff is AMAZING. The biscuits and gravy are one of my favorite items to get. The omelettes are so tasty and make me like boring omelettes again. Lots of condiments on the table (always a plus for me) and the service is always pretty good. Only cons (for some people; not really for me) are that its relatively small and theres always a wait on the weekends but never more than 25 minutes. [REVIEW_28] While on vacation during Mardi Gras my friends and I ate here twice!! The people were super nice and the food was delish!! Definitely a must when going through New Orleans!! [REVIEW_29] Absolutely delicious !!!  Friendly staff; clean; cozy place.  Tasty food.  Great vegan options! [REVIEW_30] Amazing fresh pressed juice and breakfast food. We make it a point to come here every time we are in NOLA.",23
96,"[REVIEW_1] short ugly girl has Bad customer service!  I don't recommend this place at all; they won't give you your money back if you do an early cancellation!! [REVIEW_2] The best Indian flavor in the St. Louis area has a new location. Lucky me! If you're craving Indian or wanting to try it for the first time then search no more. Try the Lunch buffet or go for dinner. You'll love the flavors from Spice of India! My favorite is the Chicken Tikka Masala! [REVIEW_3] As a Mexican that lived  in Los Angeles CA for 35 years & my wife & I recently moved to Nashville; I was looking for an authentic Mexican place that serves great food @ great prices.  We found it in Carniceria & Taqueria Don Juan.  The drive through may take a while so plan ahead (it makes sense to me since food is authentic) & don't be surprised with the appearance of the place!  This is one of the best places if not the best I ever had. Better than most Mexican places in LA.  MUST try carne asada burritos & tacos & Mexican coke to go with! [REVIEW_4] Overpriced mediocrity.  Please don't waste your money here.  My family has eaten here twice and both times ""corporate"" has refunded the price of our meals because it has been so appalling.  This corporation/restaurant has no clue.  Please don't be ripped off. [REVIEW_5] What a perfect way and meal to end our trip.   One of several restaurants owned by Chef John Besh In New Orleans.  From appetizer to entrees all the way to the end; dessert.   For our appetizer we split the Crab Meat Maison; served with fresh herbs; touch of horseradish and country bread croutons.   My choice of entree was the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp over Roasted Jalapeño Cheese Grits and Andouille/green onion sausage.  I have never been a fan of grits before.  They have always been kind of bland; this one knocked my socks off.   The wife went with the Fresh Gulf Fish done Amandine Style.  It was lightly battered with buttermilk and flour; then fried and topped with Almonds in a brown butter sauce.  Served with new potatoes; green beans and roasted vegetables.   Please; try to save room for dessert.  Somehow we did. With two Cappuccinos we ordered Brendan's Bread Pudding. This is to die for! It is topped with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and is accompanied by a buttered pecan sauce.  Also ordered the Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Tart; made with bittersweet chocolate and topped with Coconut Sorbet.   Put this place on your bucket list of restaurants in NOLA. You won't be disappointed. [REVIEW_6] The store smells amazing when you walk in;  we loved the tourtes or turtles I think thier called. The pecan candy apple is literally the best candy apple I ever had. [REVIEW_7] Amazing rolls. Amazing service. Fun waitresses that like to have a great conversations.   I recommend the all you can eat sushi rolls.    Place gets crowded; so plan accordingly.  I can see why it gets crowded since it's a great value amongst all the overpriced places in the area.   Must visit place if you are in the Reno area. [REVIEW_8] Holy cow! First time I tot his little dive bar and had an amazing experience! The food was great and the bartender was great at explaining the process.   The pizza itself is a cheesy; crispy; deep dish pizza that has so much flavor from the crust to the sauce. We had pepperoni and bacon; which was amazing! Will definitely be back here again! [REVIEW_9] This paper was originally called the levittown news now it goes by the courier times. In the last 15 years they have consistantly reported stories the local tv ststions did 3 days prior to the courier's publishing times. Many call it the levittown liar due to some reporters injecting facts that were made up in many instances. Plus the paper takes some unusual stances on matters that they have no business doing rather than reporting both sides of the story. Many here no longer subscribe to it anymore due to delay and misinformation they publish. Perhaps at some point in the furture they will return to being a respected source of news. [REVIEW_10] The food is awesome. I live about 20mins away and this place is worth the drive every time. They also give military discounts for all the troops! [REVIEW_11] I decided to try Wicke Auto recently for state safety and emission inspections.  It was convenient for where I work and they were able to get me in.  I wasn't disappointed.  It's a nice big shop and a friendly man named Gary will work with you.  The safety inspection yielded a need for a very small repair and they were able to order the part and have it repaired by the end of the day.  I dropped it off at 8:45am and picked it up by 4pm.  Gary was kind; patient; and knowledgeable.  Charges weren't the cheapest or the most expensive.  Solid experience and I'll go back for a quote should I need service in the future. [REVIEW_12] Erika is the sweetest waitress ever. Food is on par with a chain restuarant; but the staff makes it perfect. Thank you! [REVIEW_13] I've been a Bargain Thrift fan since the age of 14 and I've never left empty-handed. Top-notch vintage and less expensive than the thrift shops in Center City of course. Through all of their transitions; from the one location to the next (both next door to each other) their selections have never faltered. I've always enjoyed the volunteer LaSalle students who are young and fresh and share a passion for second hand items although they can be competition on those hard to find ""hip"" items you may have your eye on (I think they are volunteers; not sure). Always a decent tag sale going on; in which they offer 1/2 off on a certain items having that same color tag. No doubt the $1 store further down is a true gem but I tend to find more at the regular priced location. Another point worth mentioning is that the plus sized crowd is sure to find handfuls of decent wares as well which is something I've heard friends criticize other thrift stores for falling short on. [REVIEW_14] Negative 5 stars. Worst service and slow; 15 minutes for 1 panini. They use microwaves people so its not even fresh; just crap. I'm sure they don't CLEAN them either. Disgusting; Get Real. I will go buy a frozen breakfast sandwhich & cook it my own CLEAN microwave which isn't cooked with everybody else's crap. NEVER AGAIN will go here. Btw i waited so long i got my money back. Keep your crappy sandwhich and enjoy [REVIEW_15] Hubby wanted to visit Oak Street.  Take note - nothing going on during a Monday afternoon!  We stopped at Mellow Mushroom for lunch as it was pretty much the only place open.  Delivered as any MM does.  Food and drinks right on point. [REVIEW_16] The nicest people in the world work here.  I've purchased gardening goods and had a gazillion keys cut here and have never been disappointed or had to return a key because it didn't work.  I drive across the city to get keys made now instead of chancing a few trips to Home Depot. The amount of stuff packed into this place is impressive; and yet it doesn't feel cluttered.  Prices are also incredibly reasonable. Good stuff. [REVIEW_17] The staff was super nice and let us try some samples. It looked nice and clean in there! They have all the speciality favors out in the front and the standard flavors are in the back. I really loved my waffle cone with chocolate chip ice cream! The Cookie Monster ice cream was good too! [REVIEW_18] This is my favorite Mexican restaurant outside of California at the moment but I dare say they are giving those places a run for their money. I got stuck on the torta and get it every time I go because it's so freaking delicious. The salsa is killer; the owners are amazing; oh and the Jamaica (hibiscus tea) is the best I've had.  Everybody should eat here. [REVIEW_19] Terrible; terrible service. Entitled hipsters who confuse orders; give attitude; and ruin customer's experience. The new manager is also frumpy and has awful music taste; think awful 50s - 80s rock/reggae music that's disappeared for a reason; but blared close to full volume. Softer; more neutral music would be greatly appreciated. Terrible consistency with orders too; they don't have consistent standards with coffee etc.  Customers are mostly Penn students; business types who interact with the school (recruiters from NYC etc) and visitors to the area. It's almost as if the staff feel some kind of insecurity or have pride issues serving almost always polite patrons.   Gelato is pretty good and coffee is pretty good but can be sloppily made (I.e mix your own iced latte). Also slimmed down portion sizes and got rid of the bar. The place has a great location and nice open feel to it; but so much potential is lost because of really shitty staff with terrible attitudes. So many frequent customers but the staff make no effort to get to know them (and trust me; they try). I can't emphasise enough how much the staff and manager need to change. [REVIEW_20] We had the charbroiled oysters and they were delicious!  This was just the thing we needed to get our quick oyster fix... The sashimi was fresh and the lychee martini was the perfect pair for it!  Definitely and highly suggest this place [REVIEW_21] Joe and his son installed three garage doors on our new construction. They were organized; efficient and friendly. We are very happy with the quality; look and style of our new garage doors. [REVIEW_22] Probably one of my favorite places to go. The Appetizers are amazing! Would recommend getting The Brussels Sprouts; The Fish Tacos & The Pretzels. The beer is amazing always taste so fresh; I've tried every beer they brew and not one of them I didn't like! [REVIEW_23] ONE OF THE BEST AND FRIENDLIEST INDIAN RESTAURANTS IN THIS AREA AND TAMPA. I live nearby and eat a lot of Indian food between California and Florida in my life. Gateway is one of the top 3 indian restaurant I have eaten at. The service is always so friendly and the staff takes time to make small talk with you; which is unusual. I order out or eat in almost every week. [REVIEW_24] Finally went in after walking by so many times. Glad we did. Small place but IR is pleasing to the eye. One wall cover with wood palates and subtle two tone gray walls. Started with the prosciutto fig arugula Parmesan flatbread appetites. Enough for two people and delicious. Nice mix of flavors. Main dishes were a burger grass fed beef with fries coated with truffles dusting. Burger was humongous!  Looked good smelled good and tasted good. I had a seafood soup with fish ( not sure what it was) shrimp and mollusks in a  coconut/ curry broth. Deliciously spicy but not enough to kill your taste buds. Overall I would recommend this place. We went early as we heard it gets crowded and they do not take reservations.  BYW great wine and craft beer selections [REVIEW_25] The food was awesome and the service was warm and genuine. I liked the coziness of the space. Parking was as easy as it gets with a parking lot in the back. I never write reviews; but I felt compelled to write this one because the food really was stellar. Try the Zeppolis; you will crave them every time you settle for a donut. [REVIEW_26] This is the most poorly designed mall I have ever seen.  You have to cut across parking lots to get from place to place...in either the hot blazing sun or the freezing wind.  Reno officials were completely ripped off by the designers of this ""strip"" mall. For a beautiful example of a great outdoor mall check out The Grove in So Cal.  All parking is on the outside with the stores clustered on the inside. Would not have cost any more for this more efficient design. This mall is ridiculous. [REVIEW_27] Excellent chicken wings and pizza Is outstanding. Service was also great in this Saturday afternoon. [REVIEW_28] This is definitely the best breakfast place in Philly. İf you bored for classic breakfast routine you should definitely come and visit this place for unique taste super fast service; delicious coffee and friendly environment. Highly recommend it for this place for breakfast lunch or brunch. It's not like a regular classic American breakfast. It's a little expensive but it's worth every penny. Come on in and enjoy middle eastern hospitality. [REVIEW_29] This place just could not be better. I love how they have a fully stocked new release section. You never have to worry if whether they have a new release or not. Great! I even have to admit that I don't mind when I have to pay late fees; because I love supporting this place. [REVIEW_30] I generally love food trucks when the food is of high quality. This food truck had excellent food when I visited Indianapolis. Not only do they not use any MSG or other preservatives but they had all the best Americanized Chinese Food dishes available (including fortune cookies for dessert); and as I was visiting the USA it was a great opportunity to have some Americanized Chinese food dishes that I don't often see at home. The staff member working in the truck was super friendly and the food arrived quickly after my ordering.  There was a good amount of vegetables; fried food; and otherwise in my combo lunch and I felt great after eating it. It filled me up very well and the truck didn't have too long of a line either.",24
97,"[REVIEW_1] Don't shop here! The main manager here is a total bitch; I wore a pair of Levi shoes to school for one class; the shoes tore into the back of my heel to the point of bleeding and blistering; I went to return the item and was told I could not; even after explaining that we had asked the return policy BEFORE buying the shoes; to which the employee only told us we had 30 day; which is complete LIE; you have 30 days if they are totally unworn... how are you supposed to tell if the quality of the shoe is okay if you don't ware them? What if the glue peels or they completely fall apart? You are suckered into buying them and then you are told you are completely SOL if the shoe is of very bad quality. The manager needs to be fired; no managerial skills whatsoever; who trained her; Hiter? Again I strongly urge you to buy shoes from a better store! [REVIEW_2] I have no further interest in speaking with the owners about their terrible service; lack of communication; and sub-par floral displays.  I stand by my review of this establishment and once again urge other potential customers to look elsewhere for flowers if you are holding a large social event.  My event did occur and Pure's endless stream of lies DID happen.  Thankfully our guests were able to ignore the lackluster flowers and have a good time regardless.  It is great to have a site like Yelp where businesses can be held responsible for their unscrupulous behavior. [REVIEW_3] If I could give a negative I would but that's yelps scoring problem  We went for Sunday brunch based upon a best of review in creative loafing. We were told a birthday party just came in so it would be 15 minutes but we could sit. So we did. For about 5 minutes and the waiter 1 came over and took our orders. Bacon and eggs and one of the salad combinations. Waiter 2 brought us a water and coffee after another 20 minutes and said our order was good. About 30 minutes later we got refills.  It was then i commented that the folks beside us to the left had arrived about 15 minutes ago and had just been served  Finally after 1 hour and 15 minutes we got served.  Then when the bill came we were charged $10 for an $8 item and $10 for a $6 item. That took about 10 minutes to correct.  All in all an absolutely MISERABLE experience.  Nothing would make me go back. First time I my life I left a zero tip.  The final nail was when I was trying to get the bill corrected waiter 1 was comping the other table for drinks because of the wait.  I wish I had read the other yelp sunday reviews before going there because they are absolutely correct.  Might I suggest closing for Sunday until you can do it right cause it's going to catch up [REVIEW_4] The local staff don't appear to be keeping truck inventory statuses and availability accurate and relative ""real time"" - pick a business goal like ""updated in the system within x minutes (assess each on a couple key factors; perhaps group similar actions together; and define 2-3 tiers of service expectations in an SLA; based on the service uncertainty/complexity; its ""sensitivity"" analysis based on range of quality level and their relative impact to the customer.  Clearly; what the General Manager is working at or too; with respect to %accuracy and timeliness of updates to the online reservation system. Some examples are: - truck availability update window (15-30 minutes of a change in state; truck location)     (e.g. departed to destination; arrived at destination; cleaned & prepped; in service)  I made my online reservation Friday pickup either the Tuesday or Wednesday morning prior.  Based on the system availability and near ""real time"" electronic inventory data and known schedules for use/return to service; the system offered me the chance to request a  24 foot truck from location A (nearer to my house) at 9:00am on Friday.  A couple hours later; I got my ""confirmation"" telling me I could have a 24 foot truck from location B (twice as far from my house - about 30 minutes). And; the truck would be available at 12:00pm...but we could probably count on 9:00am (but I should call to confirm Friday morning.) If figured this was because the data changed after I made the request... not the case.  It wasn't right to begin with...and never did get updated in a timely manner; causing multiple trips; wasted time and conflicting data/opinions. Not an ""end to end"" customer focused supply chain...IMHO  I had a wasted trip way up north in Indy; and was told blatantly inaccurate information twice - wasting time; destroying trust and credibility from UHaul's perspective...  Eventually a lightbulb turned on.... The ""root cause"" here appears to be the failure of the local Uhaul to either have customer focused SLA's by which they are measured for their role/impact in the ""supply chain.""  OR; they had the SLA's in place...and were consistently not meeting them.  The local staff don't appear to be keeping truck inventory statuses and availability accurate and relative ""real time"" - pick a business goal like ""updated in the system within x minutes (assess each on a couple key factors; perhaps group similar actions together; and define 2-3 tiers of service expectations in an SLA; based on the service uncertainty/complexity; its ""sensitivity"" analysis based on range of quality level and their relative impact to the customer.

Some examples are: - truck availability update window (15-30 minutes of a change in state; truck location)     (e.g. departed to destination; arrived at destination; cleaned & prepped; in service)  If you truly take this to heart; I'd welcome hearing from you more to clarify any misunderstandings; and hear what specific actions you're taking / data you discover to support or challenge my assumptions and conclusions. [REVIEW_5] Absolutely terrible customer service. I am for sure ranting here... Asked for a happy hour menu on one of my visits. The lady bartender said it was happy hour and she would get me a menu. Ordered fried pickles and a beer from the menu. Went to pay my bill an hour later and the dude with the long beard behind the bar rung me up. My bill was for normal price (and overpriced). He said the order was put it at 3:59 it looked like. He was a total jerk about it with no forgiveness after I told him I was led to believe it was happy hour. Needless to say there was no tip!  I went back; a few days later; shockingly. Ordered a cocktail. A simple old fashioned with brandy. I asked for soco and they didn't have it. So i asked for brandy. Cocktail was good. Get the bill later ... $12 cocktail. For real! It wasn't even an 8oz cocktail. More like a 4oz! And there was a $4 bogus charge on there which i was unaware about when ordering and that long bearded guy again behind the bar told me what it was for after the fact (something to do with adding a higher liquor quantity). I wouldn't have wanted that in the first place!! So again; no forgiveness and forced to pay that bill. Again; zero tip.   otherwise; you can get takeout beer here and the outdoor couches are ok. But customer service really blows!!! they're so slow and unforgiving and confusing ! I hope that long bearded guy is not a manager. Very pathetic [REVIEW_6] DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A CALIFORNIA LICENSE! I would literally give this place 0 stars if I could. I've never felt the urge to write a review before but I'm just so dumbfounded with how I was treated this evening. The bouncer was the rudest person I've ever met. I was very patient and polite with him when it was my turn and I smiled at him when he shined the light on me and that's when he asked me for another form of ID. This was foreign to me because I've literally never had anyone question my PASSPORT ID! I told him no and he made me leave (grabbed me when I tried to get my friends attention to tell her they wouldn't let me in). So I'm already annoyed and I kind of made a scene but I went all the way to my car to grab my license (which doesn't have my picture cause I'm from WA and I renewed via mail) and my debit card which has my picture on it as well. I wait in the long line again only for him to tell me ""I don't believe these are you"" without even looking at my 2 new forms of ID. He didn't even try to ask me any specific questions to see if it's me (ID #; weight; etc) he just singled me out of my group of 15+ people like an as*hole. I was literally so confused at this man trying to tell me that multiple pictures of me are not me... Needless to say; I'm going to make a phone call or two tomorrow because this is unacceptable and very unprofessional and should not be tolerated. [REVIEW_7] I've been doing DIP powder for years. Every time it lasts 3-6 weeks without chipping. I did my nails here for the second time and within a week I had two broken nails. I went back and they fixed it but within two days more nails were chipping off. The pedicures are nice with the stones but after spending almost $70 in everything and my nails looking this bad after only a week I will not be going back here again. [REVIEW_8] What a disappointment. This place was not good I would suggest you think twice before selecting this option. The manager and wait staff may possibly be the worst I have ever encountered; rude and definitely not focused on customer service.  The manager is a very angry hostile fella I asked if I could get brown rice instead of white and he blasted me...I offered to pay extra and he stormed off? Do not know what the deal was but this is just plain unprofessional and creepy behavior. The waitresses will smack into you while you are eating...man what a mess this place is from top to bottom. The food just OK at best! I am seriously complimenting them here... you can do better at home than here. Seriously I am not going to go into you have been warned just yuk...OK? these other folks with the positive reviews for this place must burn off their taste buds with adult beverages. (Didn't try the sake it may be the high point of the joint...but why would I want to expose my taste buds to a substandard meal to enjoy some rice wine? I can do this at home.  Here is something I am not sure of; I have only lived here a few months now; is it customary to charge for each soda every time you get a refill here? I was charged for each I asked why they said ""This is how we do it here."" So at $2 bucks per 6-8 ounces of beverage you may want to go with water at this place...but smarter yet! Go elsewhere. I will not be returning to this establishment.  Worst yet. [REVIEW_9] We walked in with every intention to spend a good amount of money on souvenirs. My husband gave me a kiss in the store and she kicked us out and told us it is a place of business and we need a hotel. Meanwhile she was eating her lunch  at the register and chomping away and didn't even great us. Yikes. Hope they reconsider their tactics. [REVIEW_10] When I called she put me on hold 3 times. Was very rude. Then when delivery came received wrong order. She wouldn't fix this; and hung up on me 3 times. Very rude and horrible service. Don't go there [REVIEW_11] I will never go back there again. I decided last minute to get a silkwrap instead of just a manicure. I'm not really a nail person; I get my nails done maybe once a month. I tried to explain to her how I wanted them done; which was kind of hard because of the language barrier. I don't like the fake plastic tip because they damage your real nail. I watched several Youtube videos on how a silkwrap was a better alternative. Anyway because I wanted a little length to my nails she was going to use the plastic tips. I told her no; and I explained to her why. She said so you want to use your own nail; I said yes. Long story short and $35 later I have a regular manicure. When I saw how short she was filing the nail (which was my own nails length); I asked her what she was doing. She stated this is how its done and there was nothing else she could do since I didn't want the tips. So even though I was unsatisfied with her service I tip her anyway. I guess she was unhappy with the tip and after she finished painting my nails; she had me dry them using the mini fan at her station. Normally they take you to the drying station. And I was supposed to receive another service; but she started work on someone else. By this time I'm livid; I grab my things and left. I was able to find another place to get my eye brows done (Brown Spa; which they did an excellent job and was very polite). I asked the tech about silkwraps and she confirmed what I though. She also told me she never goes to Tip Top Nails ""they're terrible"". I was able to find the Youtube video; so I went back to Tip Top Nails and show it to her. She said they don't do it like that; and that if I showed her the video before she would have told me no. They refused to do my nails the way I wanted them; and refused to give me a refund. I'm a stay at home mom so I don't get many days to myself; and it pisses me off that this chick messed up my day. Save yourself some money and go to a different salon. The Tip Top Nail Salon in the Galleria Mall (Brentwood; MO) is so much better. [REVIEW_12] From the looks of it; Helzberg really don't care much about the social media comments and their customer's satisfaction. Today my wife and I just came out of Macy's cancel one of the ring I bought her for Valentine's Day due to wrong size. I already knew their services have gone to the gutter in recent years; its worse than going to a car dealership; where you get judged by their superficial eyes. If they don't think you are going to buy; they don't want to waste a second on you. So I told the first lady who greet us straight up; I was looking for a diamond ring around $800; I showed her the picture of the ring we cancelled at Macy's; all I asked is something comparable in price for a gold diamond ring. She showed me one right away but the diamond was a lot smaller than what we were looking for.  But she was able to find another one; not perfect; but at least my wife liked. I asked her what is the best price she can give us; after some negotiation; she said there is a $150 discount; and because we were still unsure (the diamond was still a lot smaller than the one in Macy's for similar price); she said she would throw in resizing service for free. It was already around noon time; both of us were hungry and I didn't want to rush a decision like this; so I told her we will think over lunch and be back if we decides.   So later that evening; I got the chance to go out alone; so I went back to the store to make the purchase. Right away I made the mistake telling the ladies that are working there I was there earlier; talked to a tall older lady; and I'm ready to make the purchase. At the time there were three of them; one was busy with the customer; one was on the phone; then there is a lady completely free. But you can tell right away she does not want to help me since I was already here before; even she get some commission it will not be the whole commission. So she told me go talk to the lady on the phone... Then the lady on the phone doesn't seem to have any interest helping me either; kind of yelling across from the store to the other ""free"" lady something I didn't even pay attention. So I'm standing in the middle of them feeling unwanted by those two. Finally the first free lady ask me whats my name blah blah... after wasted few more minutes she finally asked me which ring. So I pointed to the ring and told her what price was promised me earlier. Again she asked my name (for what reason I don't know); then she asked me if I had the other lady's card (I wasn't very happy with the first lady's service to begin with; she often answered my question in a snobbish way as if we couldn't afford the more expensive ring like ""oh that's $3000...."" in a condescending tone. So even when I told her we will think over lunch she didn't bother to give me her card.    By now; the evening lady was trying to hint to the other lady I had no reference maybe she should just sell to me like a regular sale. The other lady obviously doesn't want her to get the complete commission (also it is breaking the industry rule). While all of them keep having the tone I was just making up the price which I was promised from the morning lady! So I said maybe you should call her up; most sales people who care about their commission wouldn't mind the phone call.  At first the evening lady doesn't seem want to (too much work to make a call you know); finally the other lady also suggest she should call. So she went to the back room for roughly 5 to 10 minutes (don't know why she couldn't just call right front of me; the phone is right there!)  She comes back and told me there are not even a $150 discount (even though there is advertisement for $50 off on $299 purchase; and we always get their catelog in the mail; usually is $50 for every x amount of purchase; the ring originally is $900; which made sense when the morning lady quoted $150 discount). On top of that; there is a free $300 speaker promotion going on for anything over $600; and the morning lady said I can chose $150 discount or the $300 speaker.   Anyway; my point of writing this review isn't even about not getting the originally quoted price; I sincerely hope who ever runs Helzberg Diamonds's marketing; online marketing; social media marketing or even if just the store manager who actually care about his or her store image; can take a look at their staff. The culture they are building has changed so much since we bought our wedding band over 10 years ago. I read few other people's review; they shared the similar feeling. Their staff are just bunch of vulchers.  I worked a commission job throughout my college years; I don't know what happened in recent years. these people on commission doesn't understand how to treat their customers; and just expect the customers pay their paycheck. This mindset became very sickening to the society! And they only pride on Mr Warren Buffeft's name but not his vision! [REVIEW_13] My son got a pho and thought it was ok. My daughter got the tofu pad Thai and she said it was horrible. It tasted very bland; with almost no flavor; also; it was super spicy!! All in all; we didn't really like the food here. [REVIEW_14] Mini size boong-uh-bbang for $2??? Photo looks like regular size.  False advertising. [REVIEW_15] This is what I've been waiting for!!! Finally a good wing spot in Madison. I just tried it for the first time and was super impressed! It's clean with awesome aviation themed decor. The wings were big; tasty; and fresh. I tried 4 flavors all of which were great. The seasoned fries were out of this world and you could see the entire process of prep from the table. Nice beer selection as well. The cook came out to the table to check on things and was very friendly. The prices are on par with most wing spots but their product is hands down better; I will definitely be back! [REVIEW_16] I've been to this Chili's three times since moving to Reno a few months ago and I won't be back. Each time we've gone; we've waited to be seated with barely anyone in the restaurant and not acknowledged by the staff. When the hostess finally came up she was like a zombie and was half awake.  Our waitresses each time were different girls but both acted like they were irritated they had another table to serve. Very unfriendly and tried to rush us through the process. When we ordered we asked our waitress what the choices of sides were and she rolled her eyes and put a menu in front of us and said; ""they're listed in here"". So sorry to put you out! The chicken in my tacos was hard as a rock. When we were leaving; the hostess was at the door talking with a waitress about what they did on New Years and completely ignored us when we left. If your only job is to greet; seat; and open the door for customers; you should be fired because you couldn't handle one aspect of your job. Sorry; but if you're making your living off customers and tips; learn some customer service and get your attitude straight. [REVIEW_17] Unfortunately; I'm NOT happy after coming to this salon yet again. I got a message from the owner saying he'd like to have me come in to receive a FREE service because they previously ruined my hair. So; I thought since he's the owner my hair would turn out good but I was wrong. I'm really unhappy with this whole experience. I showed him multiple photos on google of what I wanted done to my hair which was a lot of blonde. I told him I do not want any ORANGE in my hair as I wanted a ""white blonde"". He said you won't have any orange in your hair. I have a message from him the OWNER saying I would receive a FREE service if I deleted my previous review. He should of NEVER offered a free service if it wasn't really free! So; I said how much because I thought I was getting my hair done for free. He said since your hair is long and thick you'll have to pay for the hair color and ""medicine"" but he won't charge me for his time. I said ok how much he said $80. He said it would cost me $180 if he didn't give me a discount which is very pricey. He put a lot of highlights on my hair and worked quickly as he seemed to want to rush on my hair which I do not like. My hair is important to me; I don't want my hair to fall out. He said this medicine he's gonna put on my hair is $50 for a treatment and that I needed it because of the blonde going on my hair which I know any coloring is damaging and blonde is very damaging but he said he charges everyone who gets hair color for this so called medicine which they mix into the color you dye your hair. You can purchase the entire set online (3 bottles) for $75 which is supposed to give you like 15 applications so he's definitely charging a lot of money! He only put No.1 on my hair and not No.2 or No.3. He also had a lady (the receptionist) wash out my hair? Ok; even though she was nice why would he have her do that when she said she knows nothing about hair because I asked if she's styling my hair and she said she doesn't do hair and I wouldn't want her to do my hair. As I was waiting there was a lady next to me; she got her hair cut and a perm. She was done but she wasn't happy; she told the lady she didn't like the hair cut and she had her style it more and trim off a little more but the lady still wasn't happy. The girl told the client when she washes her hair it will be better.. um how? I know she left very unhappy! Also the lady behind me was getting her hair cut and when he (the owner) was done cutting her hair she looked in the mirror and wanted it different and styled different so that made me have to wait longer but 2 clients were not happy and also myself. That's not a good look TJ nail and spa! I had a towel on my head and waited about 30 mins just to get my hair blow dried because he was cutting another clients hair. I seen orange roots; I was mad!!! He finally came over and I said I don't like the orange color on my roots; can you put a toner on my hair and he said it's not orange it's the lighting. The lighting?! It wasn't the lighting! He proceeds to blow dry hair and then starts straighten it without asking me if I wanted it straightened or curled; you are supposed to pick how you want your hair styled. At that point I knew my hair wasn't what I wanted and it wasn't gonna be fixed even if I wanted it too. I just sat there in the hair; mad and yet again very disappointed! I looked in the mirror and seen my hair damaged and brittle; orange and brassy and not even close to what I wanted. There goes my money down the drain; yet again. I will not be back to get my hair ruined and he made me delete my previous review which was also 0-1 stars before I left his salon but I had to write this one; this is real; this is honest; beware of getting your hair completely ruined and nothing close to what you want! Like I said I showed the OWNER multiple photos and I stated I did NOT want any orange on my hair but I did have orange on my hair; I didn't get what I wanted like he said; he said he doesn't mess up; he's been doing hair for years. As a salon owner I think he should take the time to really do what the client wants and achieve what the client wants done to their hair; if the workersowner would do that then there shouldn't be any bad reviews but there is so that shows you they do not care; not even the owner cares. They just want to rush and get done to get paid; they don't care if the customer is happy or not. There are more bad reviews from people going to this salon and having horrible experiences but he is bribing people to delete their bad reviews because he told me the bad reviews is hurting his business which is why people do reviews; to let people know this place is awesome or this place is horrible; beware; stay away. I do reviews to let people know the good; the bad and the ugly. I do reviews anywhere and I'm always 100% honest. So; if bad reviews hurt his business that is all on him and his employees not me or anyone else. [REVIEW_18] Even one star is too much. Rude; slow and ignorant staff. We waited more than 45 minutes only for one scrambled egg. Finally one of the staff came and said that they could not make our order since they were so busy and apologized. However the restaurant was half-empty and quite. In the meantime; we saw customers that arrived after us but received their food and drinks earlier. Disgusting. I think this restaurant likes big orders. They put big orders in the priority. Unprofessional.  I would never come back. Don't waste your time here. Try other places nearby [REVIEW_19] While I was moving in and had all my stuff on my patio the inspector left a note that was threatening : Stating I had inappropriate items on my patio  Trash left out  EXCUSE me but I was moving !!!!!! So I went to the office and a woman named Deborah helped me .. Very condescending .. Acted like I had no right to complain about my note... Then I asked for a copy of my lease.. Oops again ....  We're sorry you can't have that it's under lock and key!!! WHAT!!!!! This volley of info and rudeness continued until she came out and said they were closing the office for the night!! WOW what a difference from my rental I'm Asheville NC.. Friendly clean always remembered who we were even though it was a huge complex.. Ohhh ; they will be friendly when you are looking but once you sign the dotted line ....not so great!!!! You're just a number ; you mean nothing to SENTINAL CORP believe me or they would have a nicer staff and wouldn't have to threaten you when your trying to get all your stuff put away!!!! [REVIEW_20] Rudest bartenders I've encountered. Made us wait forever for drinks while they texted. Female bartender lost my husband's card when I tried to close out our tab and told me to calm down when I explained the green card she was holding wasn't ours. she insisted she did not have my husband's card at all and continued to speak to me like I was a moron. Never going back again! [REVIEW_21] After coming here for many years; I was very disappointed by my last trip. The one place you never cut corners is in the food; and that's exactly what they did. 2 of the 3 salsas were so watery that you didn't get any tomatillo or tomato on your chip; at all. The third salsa; the pics de gallo; was the worst chop job I've ever seen in a restaurant. Huge pieces of Serrano pepper with varying sizes of everything else; and in stark contrast to the other 2; completely dried out.   Without even looking at the menu; I know what I want... #15. That decision hasn't changed for over 10 years. Today I should have made a different choice. I'm not sure if they recently went thru a purveyor change but the quality of everything on the plate was horrible.   I used to love the rice; it changed. I used to love the chicken quesadilla; now it's flavorless and covered in 2 lbs of cheese for 1/2 a breast.  Please go back to your old ways and cut costs elsewhere; other than the food. [REVIEW_22] I've been here a few times and have always had a consistently decent filet mignon. Supper was acceptable; not memorable. Pricey; especially for a chain restaurant; but not nearly as good as other high-end chains like Morton's or Capitol Grille.  Unfortunately; the one lucid memory I have of Ruth's Chris doesn't even involve steak. I ordered a glass of Glenmorangie 18 neat; i.e. without ice. The waiter said; ""excuse me; sir; but I believe you mean to say N.I. ... en aye"" I threw him a befuddled look. He continued; ""It stands for No Ice. That is the correct term."" I could have gone on arguing back and forth but I didn't want to embarrass him. For the record; ""neat"" is the correct term. N.I. sounds like something from Monty Python's Holy Grail.  -1 for being condescending -3 for being condescending and wrong. [REVIEW_23] outdoor pool not heated.  smelled cigarette smoke inside hotel; allows pets a negative for us; the eliptical exercise equipment was very strange; looked like it was with a bicycle.  couldn't figure it out.  will try a different hampton in Tucson next time.  been staying at this one for years; and it's gone downhill. [REVIEW_24] (This review was attached to the previous address and name a few months after they opened at TV and Cat Highway; I have moved it here; though another form of the name is on the map too?) anyway ... We tried to dine here. I called ahead to ask some questions about the menu and some allergies we work with in our family (because I know that stopping the flow of a dinner service to ask the chef and/or manager questions isn't cool.) So I got the manager on the phone and it's clear that she isn't trained in the school of customer service and food allergies. I get it. Allergies suck to have to accommodate--even if it's just to answer a question about ingredients (try living with it). But when it comes down to having a table full of vomit and/or an epi pen getting whipped out; ""Pretty sure..."" just doesn't cut it. Apparently they get their bread/buns from Vero's and therefore in the mystical teleportation device that procures the bread; no ingredient list is a available. But that's okay because some of their employees have worked there for like 10 years and know a lot of ingredients and things. But just not for sure if the buns contain eggs. But I could call Vero's myself to check. *sigh* I tried helping educate this defensive manager about how to better serve a party with food allergies (step 1: don't tell them to call a vendor to check your own product); but what's the point? They clearly didn't want our business anyway. [REVIEW_25] Breakfast was vile; everything tasted like grease! [REVIEW_26] Poor service. Went for lunch.  Server acted bored and could not care less.  Kitchen brought out my food as she never checked in it. Chicken was good but salad that came with lunch was full of water and premade. Server never refilled my drink and had to be tracked down. Twice. Tables were not full. Place was empty. [REVIEW_27] Be careful at this shop. They like their money and that's it. When they mess up they just give you the run around about EVENTUALLY fixing it. Nikki the manager is rude and Molly won't fix a tat she messed up. [REVIEW_28] Horrible experience; pizza was soggy and cold when I received it; took 2 hours until I actually received my order as well. Absolutely no communication on my order; even after calling twice. Once I finally received the pizza I called to get my money back; which was communicated that I would not be charged; soon to find out that I was charged the very next day. I highly recommend never ordering from here; service was horrible and they were extremely rude. I won't be ordering from here again and either should you. [REVIEW_29] Very disappointed :( We came first thing in the morning; but we're rushed through because a group had appointments an HOUR later. The girl didn't clean out my toes; skipped my cuticles; and proceeded to BURN me with her callous sander. For four days I've been walking around with sander induced Blisters and they hurt like heck! She put two coats on my big toe and one on the other toes. The decor is nice; but the staff is unprofessional and need to be trained how to do nails without rushing. You won't get return customers with this level of service. [REVIEW_30] One recommendation: STAY AWAY FROM THE MARGARITAS!  For $5.00; you get a small cup of artificially flavored; watered down liquid that reminds me of the restaurant cocktail mix bottles sold at Bed Bath & Beyond.  A Mexican establishment; with a bar and expansive drink selection; should always serve decent margaritas - no exceptions.  And the service was just as awful.  Our waitress didn't fill up our water glasses once in the 3 hours we were there; and for our table of 4; she repeatedly got our drinks wrong (but because it took forever to get them; it wasn't worth asking her to correct the orders).   For the same price; I can go to Bakersfield and drink freshly squeeze lime juice with premium; smooth tequila; and it comes in a substantially larger size.  So you can guess where I will be the next time I have a hankering for margs...",1
98,"[REVIEW_1] Best pizza I've ever had with even better service! A must place to eat in Indiana! It is fairly priced as well and caters to a variety of tastes. [REVIEW_2] Amazing. Sous vide pork chop was everything I hoped it would be. Best creme brûlée I've ever had. [REVIEW_3] I'm new to this area and so glad I found this Cleaners!!!  Excellent place!  They do great work!!  I had taken in a jacket to the Chesterfield location to have the zipper repaired.  All it needed fixed was the tab to zip up the jacket.  It works like it is brand new and cost me very little.  Very happy!!! Ben was the gentleman who helped me and he was very nice.   I met 2 wonderful folks from this location....Nikki and Nina.  They were great...so nice and helpful!  I was going to have some alterations done on some other clothing.  However after discussing what it could cost; Nikki was honest enough to say it may not be worth it as I could buy something for almost the same cost.  I so appreciated her honesty!!!  I will bring all my clothes to this location...but highly recommend any of the West Oak Cleaner locations. [REVIEW_4] I just had the worst experience with We Love Pets! It was not so much a specific problem with a product or a pet; but how poorly they handled a situation. I was scheduled to have dog my dog groomed as that is a new service they are providing.  My hsuband scheduled the first appointment for me to bring the dog on my day off; and I have to admit; a week later I completely forgot about it and did not bring her in.  We rescheduled for the following week; the day of the big snow storm and hence i cancelled the appointment. Last week was the third try; however the groomer was sick! So we tried again for today; making it late in day so that I would be able to take the dog in the afternoon as soon as I got home from work. Last night they left a message requesting we bring the dog in the morning. Today I spoke with them in the middle of the morning ; letting them know I was home sick; was trying to coordinate things; and would try to bring her in a little earlier; between 12 and 1. AT 1230 my phone rings could I bring her in immediately. Unfortunately; I am quite sick and was trying to coordinate doctors visit etc so it was going to be 1 pm when I would bring in my dog. I explained that I was unsure why they were calling as I had already agreed to move the time up one hour.  I was then told to hold on; and then told; not to bother and not to reschedule as this was the third time I had missed an appointment! NOT TRUE!!! I fully admit to missing the first appointment; and I had not yet missed todays appointment!  Before cancelling my appointment; they told me that their groomer was sitting there with nothing to do; so they wanted me to bring the dog in earlier. Is that my problem; that the groomer's schedule is not yet fully booked? They then told me they weren't supposed to schedule it that late. There again; it was their error in not educating their staff in the rules for scheduling grooming and this error was repeated multiple times when they continued to reschedule late in the day.  When I tried to explain my perspective; they hung up on me. So; my rating are for POOR PROFESSIONALISM and POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! [REVIEW_5] In my opinion there really is nothing better than a small; family-run; authentic mexican food restaurant.  There's something about this place that just hits the spot every single time no matter what I order.  The burritos blow away any of the other corporate burrito places nearby (Chipotle; Q-Doba) and cost the same to boot.  With every order comes a complimentary serving of chips and a trip to their home-made salsa bar.    The people behind the counter are the owners and employees of the place; two brothers an what seems to be their mother; always working super hard and getting the food out to order in a timely manner even if the place is packed at lunch - which it always is.  It's great to see the same smiling face every time you go in the place and it makes you wanna come back because you know these people are working their ass off to make sure you enjoy your meal.    Try the nacho burrito or the Asada burrito if it's your first time.  They're both great choices and you won't be dissapointed. [REVIEW_6] My favorite breakfast in town!! Hasher with eggs over medium! Service is spectacular. [REVIEW_7] Muriel's is a great stop in NOLA. The goat cheese and shrimp crepes are by far the best food I ate in the city (perhaps anywhere ever) and the rest of the meal lived up to the appetizer. Service is great; venue is quintessential French Quarter. It's a little distracting to see ghost tours outside the window at dinner- but the food is so delicious; you won't mind the audience. Rumor has it that Muriel's is haunted; but the only thing other worldly I encountered was the cuisine. [REVIEW_8] This hotel is a hidden gem in the desert! Clean rooms; cozy ambience and excellent customer service. Free cookies; free breakfast and free use of the business center. Highly recommend [REVIEW_9] The staff at the South Street location are absolutely AMAZING!!! I threw my boyfriend a surprise birthday party at the upstairs bar. They did everything they could to make the event special. The food was outrageously delicious; the service was incredible and the room it self was spacious. I seriously have no complaints! Ryan who worked with me from day one to plan this party was so accommodating and friendly. I felt like he was just one of my friends helping me plan it. And Claire! So much good stuff to say about her. From the start of the party she came in and made all my crazy requests work. By the end she felt like family. I will for sure be using a Paddywhacks again for any private party. I highly recommend them! You seriously won't regret it! Thanks again Ryan; Claire and all staff! [REVIEW_10] You know; all I did was stand in line to buy a suit for my little boy.  I realize the clothing is used and certainly don't expect it to be treated as a new buy.  All I needed was a hanger to hang the suit on so it wouldn't get wrinkled in the bag.  The older lady with glasses checking me out told me I could buy a hanger for the suit.  If I wasn't desperate; with a sick kid at home; whom I'm trying to nurse back to health for a piano recital tomorrow; I probably would have let this pass.  Saver's I hope a hanger was worth losing my future business.  I suggest you provide some kindness training for the rude and non-compassionate human you have working for you....Transaction 8797; register 7; operator 1515; 10:34a.  I'll go elsewhere next time where I can be treated with little kindness and respect. [REVIEW_11] There were five of us;we were planing a Bridal shower. Our waitress was Taiya she was amazing;I think she had just as much fun with us as we did with her.  My daughter and I both had a full rack of Ribs so  juicy and covered with barbecue sauce;coleslaw and fries. Had the Fallen Cherry Stout loved it;the brewmaster Doug is the best. Can't forget the bartender Kelsey love her very friendly. [REVIEW_12] Finally a Pho and Banh Mi (my FAVAORITE SANDWICH) all in one spot!  After reading alot of positive reviews from Yelp users for this place I finally made it down to Rockville Road to try for my self. I went during lunch and ordered the Grilled Beef spring rolls and the Grilled Pork Banh Mi.  The spring rolls were made fresh and had grilled beef; vermicilli and mint wrapped inside served with a side chili/fish sauce. These were very fresh tasting and that mint added just the right amount of herby-ness.  The Banh Mi was SO GOOD! Now I am a Banh Mi snob...yeah I said it. I believe that as with any sandwich the bread accounts for 50% of how good or bad a sandwich is. You can have the best toppings in the world but if you dont have the right crusty/chewy/soft bread to serve it in; whats the point?!?!?  Pho 36's Grilled Prok Banh Mi met all my criteria. It was a decent size (12""); pork was grilled just enough and not dry. The mayo on the sandwich tasted homemade. The toppongs (shredded carrots/shredded daikon radish/cilantro) were super fresh and added a great crunch. Add a lil Siracha and were off! Alot of Banh Mi sandwiches tend to not be filing enough (hence me ordering the spring rolls on this trip as well) but Pho 36's sandwich was just the right size for me and was filling.  The resturant itself is small (maybe 25-30 seats) but it was very clean and the gentlman who took my order was very knowledgable about the menu and had answers to all my questions.  Pho #^ will now be added to my weekly rotation now as I have not been able to stop thinking of my sandwich. Cant wait for the cooler months to arrive so I can start making my way through all the Pho selections on the menu. [REVIEW_13] Gooooo Eagles! Thank you for giving us our first superbowl. With Carson Wentz inside the 20 he's dangerous and invincable. Nick Foles is damaging relife. With LaGarret Blount on the infield; Zack Ertz(TE) on the midfield; and Jay Ajai on the outfield; one day we might have a perfect 16-0 [REVIEW_14] We are from out of state and came here for breakfast. Loved the location; was super cute and quiet. We had our breakfast outside near the train tracks. The waiter was so nice! We had our first beignets and OMG I'm hooked! I'm a little bummed that i won't have anymore when I return back to Oregon. All the food we ordered was simply amazing! [REVIEW_15] The dim sum menu items and soup dumplings are delicious. Very convenient location since it's close for students on campus; rather than chinatown. I would definitely recommend the Shanghai dumplings. Yum. [REVIEW_16] I believe the gentlemen at the front desk name was Kris? He was great; the rain was coming down so hard and he went above and beyond and walked me as well as Leo with an umbrella to the car!  I have taken Leonidas there for about two years now; unfortunately he is a nervous Nelly; but we started seeing Dr. Deutsch and he has been the best with Leo! He is thorough and takes his time to ensure Leo is comfy. [REVIEW_17] I came here on a hot night after hearing the hype about the new Thai style rolled ice cream place on South Street. And now I see what all the hype was about! The experience of watching the chefs at work was so entertaining; and the creations they came up with were deligant (delicious; elegant). I got the Pink Lady; and my sidepiece got the Bumblebee. It was lit AF. Go here. [REVIEW_18] The best little spot for dinner or lunch in Kenner. The gumbo or turtle soup are great ways to start your meal. I firmly believe the turtle soup at Harbor seafood is better than Commanders Palace. If you don't want soup to start look hard at the frog legs. All the poboys are good; the oyster or half and half seafood are the way to go. The boiled shrimp or crawfish are size able portions and seasoned just right. Always take a look at the daily specials; the cooks are always whipping something up worth considering. Lastly Abita beer is always cold and cheap. [REVIEW_19] We ate at three places in NOLA over 36 hours. Lunch at Muriel's ruined us for anywhere else. There was no mediocre or bad; only good and awesome.  Awesome - the gumbo. Hands down; best gumbo I've tasted in years. My wife had it and it was difficult to not steal her bowl. I had the lunch special which came with the soup of the day. Today was a crab bisque. The bisque had no meat in it; but it was delicious with plenty of flavor. I had the blackened catfish. Look in the dictionary for what I had because it was textbook blackened catfish. Excellent. Served with spinach and potatoes.   The good- My daughter had the pork chop; which might have been the disappointment. The chop was flavorful; but a tad dry. That could have been avoided.  The red beans and rice it was served with was terrific.  My wife's spinach salad looked good too.  We spent less here for lunch than we did for dinner at the Red Fish Grill. Wish we had gone back for dinner.  If you go; poke around the building. It's full of history and very cool. [REVIEW_20] Awesomeeeee place. Came here with friends at 5:30ish for dinner to beat the crowds. The place is so cute and we loved the logo. We were seated immediately. The waitress was superrrrr friendly and helpful. We got the cheese platter called Ben's bread spread to split for the appetizer. Ohmggggg soooo tasty. Homemade honey and delicious cheeses and the bread was excellent. It was out of this world and worth getting. My sister and I then split the pizza with the spicy Bianca pizza. We couldn't even finish it all after that appetizer. Sooo delicious with the peppers and cheese and thin crust. We also couldn't resist getting a whoopie pie and brownie for the road. This place is a gem! [REVIEW_21] My sister had been wanting to do archery for a while so I grabbed a random Groupon to try this out. Turned out to be a ton of fun and it wasn't super busy on a Tuesday evening so we both got to simultaneously shoot. The owner (I am assuming) has an absolutely insane sense of humor. It seemed the people who were already there are regulars and extremely helpful in keeping me from breaking the rules and killing myself. Truly a fun place to be and a great experience. Not a bad way to spend an evening. 11/10 will recommend! [REVIEW_22] Went for $5 Tuesday's and it was amazing. Located on the side of Washington Square Mall it has plenty of parking. $5 movie tickets; $5 popcorn and unlimited refills on your drinks. The theaters have really nice chairs that move and recline out; remind me of lazy boys. I'm from the west side and this was my first time going to a movie theater out east. So sketched out at first hence why I haven't tried one in the two years living out here due to a scare of bed bugs or something crazy; not the case. The place was super clean with really friendly staff. The only bummer is the assigned seating. Thankfully I got two together so my daughter and I would be next to each other. Once in there I had to kick a lady out of my seat; she was not happy. They have the letter of the row on the carpet outside the aisle and the seat numbers on the front of them lit up. Overall I was amazed and pleased with this location and will be returning next Tuesday for another watch. [REVIEW_23] Everybody loves Randy and he a man's sculptor with his vision.  Be prepared to wait when you walk in but he's worth it. [REVIEW_24] I love this crazy chicken.  Probably the cleanest; freshest and friendliest location I have been too in Reno.  Customers are usually interesting species ; but even when it's busy and annoying they handle it very well. [REVIEW_25] I was really hoping they would do something nice with this location; since it was my beloved old favorite spot to go to by myself. This is the old Filo's; I spent many nights there having a few drinks;  listening and dancing to great music by the Worship crew; then walking home.   We decided to check this place out one Friday night when a friend from out of town was visiting. It was the perfect atmosphere and food in the downstairs lounge area. The music the dj was playing was great and funky; yet not too loud; so that we could still hold a conversation. The food was spectacular; we had the Ceviche de Callos con Sandia (watermelon and scallop ceviche); I wasn't sure what to expect; it was not like the typical ceviche I have had before; but it was delicious. We also had the Queso Fundido; one with chorizo and the other with mushrooms. They were both devine!  They also have a reverse happy hour special in the lounge: Thursday - Saturday; 10pm-12am. We had some tasty margaritas (although not the best I have had; but good enough for the price); and we were feeling really nice by the time we left there; not too full; it was the perfect amount of food; and we still had some $ in our pocket!  I am definitely looking forward to going back to Xochitl. [REVIEW_26] I've eaten at many Indian places.  This one is very good!!!  I felt extremely guilty; and very happy with the lunch buffet.  It was wonderful.  Their vegetable dishes; were top notch and the Chicken Tikka Masala was some of the best I've ever had.  Also would give high marks for the Onion Chutney and Palak Paneer.  I'd eat here often if I was local. [REVIEW_27] This restaurant smells like old; sour maple syrup. It's been ten hours and I can still smell it.  The food was terrible. I have no clue how this restaurant is in business. The eggs were mushy; slimy; and very watery. I took a few bites; but the flavor was so bad I couldn't eat anymore. I just can't understand how a restaurant that specializes in cooking eggs can be so bad at it. The potatoes were also gross; tasted like old dirty potatoes that were microwaved.  The coffee was really weak; too. It tasted like watered down tea.  I just can't stress enough how bad this restaurant is. Even the flower in the case on our table was dead. Stay away!!!!! I will say; the waiter and manager were very nice and friendly. [REVIEW_28] OH GEEZE!!! We've been coming to Tucson for eight years now; for the winter gem and mineral shows...I discovered this wonderful place while browsing Yelp.   OMG; my husband and I love this place!  After tasting the two (red and green) meat mixtures you can add to their fry bread tacos; I chose the green.  It was extremely flavorful without hot spice to ruin it for me.  I talked my wimpy husband (wimpy when it comes to spicy or ""new"" foods!); to get the green...he reluctantly ordered the same.  WOW!  He was done inhaling that fry bread taco and licking his ""plate"" before I was 1/3 done with mine!  We had the desert fry bread with the works...honey; cinnamon; and powdered sugar.  Purely; simply; HEAVEN.  We; particularly the Mr.; fell in love with Indian Fry Bread about 35 years ago; in a tiny town just east of the Grand Canyon.  He has tried numerous fry breads when he finds them; but Mannas from Heaven matches and even surpasses that early love...slightly crispy on the outside; soft and tender inside.  Oh BOY; you've got to try this place! AND; this is a family owned business.  They obviously take pride in their business; and are the nicest people you'd ever want to meet.  Thank you for a terrific last meal in Tucson! [REVIEW_29] We absolutely love Club 21. My husband and I have been coming for dinner for over 40 years. The food is fabulous. We love the wait staff. The owner is the best. This is the best Mexican food in Tucson. [REVIEW_30] Definitely the best Chinese delivery place in the area.  I like to order basically the same stuff every time; pork fried rice and it's terrific.. the wife regularly tries out all the other dishes and has never had a bad thing to say.  Only knock I have is that they don't take discover.",27
99,"[REVIEW_1] Yelped this place and when we arrived the line was out the door towards the back of building. Was almost discouraged to stop but I read other Yelpers say it moves fast...in which it did and so well worth the wait. I absolutely love this place. The service is great and Katryn took my order giving me the best suggestions since I had no clue what to order; delivered my food; cleaned tables & fountain machine; and ensured customers were good and always asked us all if we needed anything. She works hard and was so kind and receptive to customers. The atmosphere was nice and Blues theme and music was playing. It was small and claustrophobic inside so we sat outside. No music on the outside though. I absolutely love this place and will make sure I visit it every time I'm in St. Louis. I'm not big in sandwiches so me giving this place 5 stars is really saying something. Great place !!! Finally a place in St. Louis I like over what we have in a Florida. I've dined at so many of the 4-5 star places around here and have not been this impressed.   I'm sure all the sandwiches are good. I ordered 7th Street Sicilian; Big Tommy (ask for Au Jus to dip) & Prez Reuben...all delicious!! Crushed Ice for fountain drink was awesome (see pic)!! [REVIEW_2] 5 years into traveling for a career; I've never HAD to write a yelp review.  While in town performing for a the week at The Playhouse on Rodney Square; our company chose to stay at this Hilton. After stepping outside to make a phone call and search for a bar of wifi; my colleague was locked out of her room (with all of her belongings inside.)  After waking me at 2:30AM the front desk told me they are ""sorry I don't have the money in my account."" This required me to show them my BANK ACCOUNT. It is then clear that I have the money and have ALREADY been charged. The man at the front desk; Laison; told me he is ""just the messenger""... and then I was told by a random employee dressed in her street clothes (named Kamari) that they were going to call the COPS on me. What?? Great night; thanks Hilton -glad I'm an honors member. [REVIEW_3] Awesome! Loved this place. Great little breakfast joint easy walk south of route 90. Easy walk from French Quarter and surrounding areas. We got the bananas foster and it was incredible. Great decorations and colorful setting that feels like how you'd expect New Orleans to feel. Highly recommend. [REVIEW_4] Dangerous.  They are OK with life endangering; lazy repairs.  My wife insists on taking her Saturn there because they used to be a Saturn dealer.  She recently bought a new set of overpriced tires and these pitiful pukes did not put in new valve stems.  Down to about 13 psi by the time she got home.  The worst.  She took my truck there for a surprise gift oil change once which I really appreciated until SURPRISE; oil all over the garage due to finger tight plug.  Buffoons [REVIEW_5] This place is worth it! Stop in and try it you won't regret it. I am not a big meat eater but I do love some good BBQ at times. I had the burnt ends and it was awesome! I've been here 3x now and each time was great! Portion sizes are large enough to share. Nice place to eat in or take out. [REVIEW_6] Great bar food; the Cuban is the sh@t.  Awesome Saturday bartender!!  All in all; a great experience. [REVIEW_7] Great drinks!!! I got the zombie one which was strong and yummy.... Three drinks later and I had to debate whether I was headed down the right path for the night haha! ALSO... give me all the duck fat fries my heart can handle with a side of cheese!!! Next time I'll get the fries with cheese AND short ribs... they were so sinfully good... [REVIEW_8] I took my gf for our one year anniversary here;  this cute little hidden  away restaurant was fantastic. Wasn't too uptight; wasn't snobbish; our waiter was very easy going and greeted us by name as we entered. The food was wonderful; and the wine list extensive. Will definitely return  Also the desert crepes made at the table were fantastic! [REVIEW_9] They sat us within 5 minutes and then took 40 minutes to even bring out sodas. The table next to us had the same server and got their good before their beverages came out. After almost an hour there with no drinks we tracked down a manager who told us our good never even got entered. I'm on my honeymoon and the friend we were there with had a date to make. Appetizer was the only thing to make it out and was decent boneless wings. Even with the manager begging us to let her get our food together free and not walk out; the service was beyond dismal and slow. First and last time coming to a Beef's. Made us all late. If we had waited at our table for the food we would have made our year anniversary before it came out. Better choices for food elsewhere. Avoid this place at all costs [REVIEW_10] Wow!!  That really sums up; in a very good way; my interactions with Delicious Designs and Leigh Anne!  Our wedding was only planned two months out and was supposed to be very very small so no cake was needed.  As the weeks went by; the guest list increased; so I decided I wanted a cake.  With probably less than a weeks notice; Leigh Anne stepped up and made the exact cake I had in my head.  I asked for a simple two tier lemon cake with no decorations.  Not only did she make this happen beautifully; she made chocolate vegan cupcakes for my daughter at the last minute.    I'm attaching a picture of the cake ""table"".  My daughter did the decorating and I must say; for someone with not much in the decorating department; everything came out better than I could ever imagine.  And not only was the cake perfect; it was yummy delicious.  I can't wait for my one year anniversary to dig in to that top layer!   If you are in need of any bakery needs in Reno and you don't use Leigh Anne with Delicious Designs; well then all I can say is I'm sorry! [REVIEW_11] I will never rent from hertz anywhere again. I reserved ahead of time through AAA. I did this because I wanted to budget.the sales lady lied to me & said I had to choose 1 of the 3 insurance packages. I told her I budgeted for yay what I was told. She pushed me & said I had no choice. My Bill went up by $97 plus tax. She was cold; pushy & rude.  I was almost crying & she didn't blink. I have never driven the new Ford Focus & she didn't go over anything. I was just a dollar sign to her [REVIEW_12] Went there on a Tuesday with my minivan; which ended up being Senior Discount Day. They didn't tell me before I paid that they won't clean or vacuum 3rd rows on Senior days. I got the Super wash; which included wax. They handed it over with large dirt smudges on the side; like it hadn't been wiped at all. A couple cup holders were barely touched and Some not at all in the front. The rest of the vacuuming wasn't good; with paper scraps still on the floor. I talked with the manager about the 3rd row and why didn't they tell me upfront when I pulled in. He said; ""I won't do your 3rd row on Senior Day. That's the way we've been doing it for 15 years."" I said I was new to the area and he said; ""That's too bad."" What kind of customer service is that?!? I usually don't write reviews; but this place was that bad. [REVIEW_13] I have been several times and it has been adequate. The last two times I have been there it has been TERRIBLE. The portions have diminished and the quality of the dishes have followed suit. I mean to a detrimental degree. I would not recommended dining here. [REVIEW_14] Below average Chinese food priced accordingly. This is fine but the front counter lady is among the rudest I have ever dealt with. Unwelcoming and cold is putting it lightly. The House Special is fine if you're struggling with the base of Maslow's hierarchy pyramid; otherwise don't bother. [REVIEW_15] Overpriced mediocrity.  Please don't waste your money here.  My family has eaten here twice and both times ""corporate"" has refunded the price of our meals because it has been so appalling.  This corporation/restaurant has no clue.  Please don't be ripped off. [REVIEW_16] Yum.  Consistently excellent. The daily menu items are a great value and fun. I could eat here every day. But.....I could not fit through the revolving door..... [REVIEW_17] The food is always amazing here! That's really all I have to say. Creative; delicious sandwiches; wonderful fries. Nice service. Do visit; prepare to wait; but it's worth it. [REVIEW_18] This place is overrated. 4.5 stars on yelp should say something about this place. Went here for dinner with some friends and everything tastes average. The best thing  on the menu is the ca phe sua da; but really; you can get great coffee at any other place. Not to mention the atmosphere and environment. It's too small and tight thats its very uncomfortable to enjoy dinner. [REVIEW_19] There is a banner on the website that says ""free shipping over $50"". This company hates honoring this promotion and it's always a a hassle to get the free shipping and they conveniently have the shopping cart set up to always charge the shipping fee even if your order total qualifies for the free shipping. Anyway; my order total came to $160 but I was still charged shipping at checkout. So I called cust svc and spoke to an idiot beyotch that was hostile and completely mathematically challenged and illogical; as her defense was that since I used a coupon on my order; I should be okay with paying the shipping fee. Huh?! When that excuse didn't work; she then said I wasn't charged shipping for the conditioner (I had 4  items on my order). Umm; that makes no sense; as I'm still paying shipping on the other items (that are packaged in the same box as the ""freely shipped"" conditioner); plus the  shipping fee is a flate rate; so what good is it if one item out of 4 is shipped free?!  I have spent hundreds of dollars w/ this company but will never ever shop here again. My advice to all consumers is to bankrupt companies that don't appreciate your business. [REVIEW_20] Decided to come by with my niece and girlfriend for late night milkshakes. Let's say from here on out I'll be going anywhere but stargate. When I called in the hostess was rude and seemed annoyed; I was met with the same feeling when we arrived. The hostess seemed annoyed that we didn't want to sit and just wanted milkshakes to go. We were handed menu anyway which didn't even have milkshakes on them. The workers were rude and dirty. I felt like I was in a drug rehab. Not to mention the milkshakes were plain and watery and overpriced. $5-6 a piece. Springfield diner is leaps and bounds better [REVIEW_21] went here for the first time today - drawn by the amazing smell of the charcoal grill.  looked around for a menu - couldnt find one..then a regular in the line said - ""theres only one thing on the menu any given day""...line was slow...had to wait almost 15 minutes with just 5 people in front..  The food was incredible...the hummus was fantastic...the falafel fantastic...the greens were easily separated (and tossed..)..the chicken was tender and amazingly tasty...and the rice-lentil mix (no idea what it really is) was terrific...there was also a giant piece of bread...whole bunch of food for $10...  definitely worth the wait...definitely worth going back again [REVIEW_22] Hands down the worst chicken and rice plate I've ever had. When I ordered I was told there was no sauce on the chicken (as I wanted; healthy). I ordered to go; by the time I reached the car the bag was full of oil spilling out of the container. There was easily 5-7 tablespoons of oil on the dish. Not what I was told and not what anyone would ever want to eat. Horrible.   Their slogan even has the word healthy in it. What a joke. [REVIEW_23] 1. Bad service - all the waitresses were congregating by the cash register. not minding the place - food came out but we weren't asked what condiments we wanted nor were we provided any eating utensils. I guess it's a self service kinda place.  2. Bad food - old cold fries - unseasoned and overcooked burger. buns weren't even  toasted.  Don't go there for food. [REVIEW_24] Loved this spot! We came here for a late bite after a 76ers game and sat at the bar. The brussel sprouts were bomb and my boyfriend loved his burger. Great service - they kept my champagne glass filled the whole night! [REVIEW_25] To long of an unnecessary wait; especially when all your tables and areas are not filled. [REVIEW_26] Always a great time coming here! Some of the cheapest soft serve in Tampa but they also have a variety of other options too such as sundaes which my dad loves.   I always get the vanilla soft serve dipped in chocolate and it never fails. I've been coming here for years with friends and family and I have so many good memories here which always makes it a pleasure to come back!   The service is super fast and it was really packed tonight so props to them for getting our orders out fast and correctly. [REVIEW_27] Love this location! The staff is so friendly and helpful; one staff member even helped me search for a lost baby shoe my ten month old had kicked off his foot! A+++ customer service. Prices are reasonable. This is a huge location! Drop the kids off and set aside 2-3 hours to explore this Mecca of current style clothing; vintage gems; records galore; housewares; great toys;etc. [REVIEW_28] Skip this train wreck if you are looking for dinner.  Our server was clueless...like we seriously thought she was lost in the restaurant.  Had to ask for setups; water refills; etc.  Ordered chicken parmesan and got eggplant parmesan instead with a fish bone in it.  The drinks were good. [REVIEW_29] My first time coming here was super awesome. So I decide to bring my Mom for my second visit. Unfortunately I was so disappointed and mad that I took my mom here for lunch. We waited for about an hour for our food and they even manage to messed it up.  Might come back for the drinks but not for the food. [REVIEW_30] The Owner is just as rude & crazy as the manager.  He refuses to listen to employee's & customer complaints.  I'd stay FAR away from this place.  Even the Spring Hill owner said people call his store complaining about the manager at Little Road.  Other employees I spoke with said she's awful to work for and people complain about her all of the time.  They fired a waitress for not being able to come in on her OFF day due to the flooded roads.  She WASN'T scheduled that day.  I'm calling the news stations;BBB & the Labor Board since the owner won't listen either.  I hope people hear this story and boycott your business!  You would've saved yourself grief if you would've just listened Steve!  Already have posted to FB and many friends said they will no longer eat there.",13
