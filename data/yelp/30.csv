0,"[""Horrible experience all the way around. 3 hostesses standing around looking bored, told us 10 min or less to seat us, then 30 some odd minutes later ( because my husband complained there were numerous tables empty and we were the only people at the time waiting) we were seated and treated as if it were a chore for one of them to seat us, talk about being unwelcomed. We also asked about a table for 6 that was empty, as there were 5 of us, and were told that this table was reserved. When I pointed out that I had called prior the day before and was told that there are no reservations, the hostess just starred at me blankly. Once seated, there was a mix up with the wait staff regarding which waiter was to serve us, no big deal. We ordered drinks, an appetizer, and dinner as soon as that was ironed out, and the waiter was pleasant and apologetic. We asked for bread and got it, drinks came soon and we were off to a better start until 30 min later they brought out clams when we ordered raw oysters, when we explained to the food runner that we didn't order clams, he said that they ran out of oysters and clams was all they had. This was an odd explanation, and we sent the clams back of course. My daughter's Caesar salad was overdressed and had large bits of anchovy, so she didn't eat much of it. After waiting for over an hour for dinner (after we had ordered), my grilled shrimp, and rice on the plate arrived to the table cold and half of the shrimp were burnt. I was hungry and tired, it was late, so I just ate the shrimp and rice. The waiter was apologetic for the wait and seemed to be trying very hard. There were two tables that needed to be cleared nearby almost the entire 2 1/2 hours we were sitting there with food all over the floor, it was disgusting. I thought to myself that one of the 3 hostesses should have stepped in to help instead of standing around an empty lobby with a sour look on their faces. It's apparently a training issue for the staff and the kitchen. Everyone else's meal was served warm or hot, so mine must have been prepared an hour or so before everyone else's. My daughter's crab cakes had so much red bell pepper, it was almost as if it was red bell pepper she ordered with a garnish of crab. So, she ate 2 bites and came home hungry. My mom was promised her own small birthday cake (since we were there to celebrate her birthday), but that never arrived, and neither did the manager. We ordered dessert since it was her birthday, but I have to say that the key lime pie was so sour most of us couldn't eat more than just the one bite. Bonefish is so much better, as well as the Shrimp Boat. Brandon could really use another good Seafood restaurant however, but this is not one of them. I can understand that in 6 months or so, they will have their routine down and the staff will be trained with all of the kinks out, but for the high price and low quality of the food we won't be coming back. I have to say that if the food was good, we'd give it another try, but it just wasn't."", ""This is the most poorly designed mall I have ever seen.  You have to cut across parking lots to get from place to place...in either the hot blazing sun or the freezing wind.  Reno officials were completely ripped off by the designers of this \""\""strip\""\"" mall. For a beautiful example of a great outdoor mall check out The Grove in So Cal.  All parking is on the outside with the stores clustered on the inside. Would not have cost any more for this more efficient design. This mall is ridiculous."", ""I was really feeling for coffee and was nowhere near a Starbucks, so I decided to stop at this Tim Hortons. I was immediately impressed with how clean the store was. I have never been to a Tim Hortons before and Maryann was super sweet and spent a lot of time explaining the menu. The iced coffee that I eventually decided on was perfect! You guys have got yourselves a new regular!"", ""Disappointing experience. Pastries (had the croissant, eclair, cannoli) are okay but nothing amazing. Dining area is small. Very limited drink options. I agree with previous reviews that it is very reminiscent of break-room coffee with 2 pump pots full of coffee and buy-in-bulk tea bags.    Really what soured the experience was the counter staff.  After my SO and I purchased several pastries, coffee, tea and went to sit down, the staff informed us that we couldn't stay because they were closing. The sign says 5pm, this was at 4pm.  She assured us that it was just that day they were closing early.   No apology. Just informed us and walked away. After all this, I had to remind her that I was still waiting for a cup of hot water to steep my warehouse earl grey tea in. We came to the cafe to sit and enjoy tea and pastries so it was obviously a disappointment to get kicked out before the advertised closing time.  I would have greatly appreciated being informed of the earlier hours prior to making a purchase or at least in the form of a sign. Would much rather enjoy a pre-made croissant and better drink options at the adjacent Starbucks or PJs. Lesson learned."", ""I have been to many TeX Mex places in my life and was really disappointed in the place. The service was really bad and the did was mediocre bland and not worth trying out. I gave them one star but will not go back."", ""If there is any place that will give you a taste of quintessential Santa Barbara, this is the place.  The location is amazing, the service is excellent, the food is fantastic.  If you like burgers, the Paradise Burger with cheese is for you.  But don't think this menu is limited.  The offerings are varied and each is excellent.  This is my go-to spot in Santa Barbara and I highly recommend it."", ""I'm at the hotel now. Finally got up to my room after they refused to let me check in 20 min early (but I saw them letting others check in). Let's not forget to mention I paid $400+ for one night here. The room is absolutely disgusting. There are stains everywhere. There is a loud ringing noise that I can't figure out what it is or where it's coming from. I'm absolutely disgusting by this place."", ""Fantastic pizza--the pie is especially good.  The house salad dressing is extraordinary! Friendly owner and attentive staff.  Highly recommended."", ""My first time here, after getting a recommendation from a colleague. One of the best cubans i have ever had, including cubans from La Teresita in Tampa, and a few places in Miami. I will definitely be trying the other items on the menu, including the yellow rice & black beans, as well as the picadillo.   What makes this family run business even better is the level of engagement each customer gets from the staff, most notably the owner and mother, who makes sure that you feel welcome and entertained. If you are looking for authentic Cuban staples, you absolutely have to experience this place."", ""The hazelnut sponge cake is the best around. Def worth the price and its always fresh."", ""Were there on a Sun afternoon & enjoyed live music, food, ambience.  Returned on Tues 6:00 pm with family and were totally disappointed.  It was very busy but, you should never have to wait over an hour after ordering before your meal arrives.  By that point we just wanted to escape the extremely loud atmosphere and poor service.  Took our meal back to hotel in take-out boxes by which time it wasn't good either.  Needless to say, we will not be returning. Bill V"", ""For the price, quality of the food, and the great staff and the chef/owner Kris Serviss you will be hard pressed to find another place like this. For those of you that don't know, earlier this year Serviss was named in Zagat's 30 under 30 for Philadelphia which is a really cool honor. He is definitely showcasing his talents at Blue Duck. We went on a Thursday night thinking around 6:30 pm thinking that we would beat the rush, we were wrong. We didn't make a reservation so we ended up waiting for a table for about 15 minutes. The whole time we were there people were waiting so it might be best to make a reservation in the future. After eating here I am can see why it's so busy, the food is outstanding and pretty much everything that can be made in house is from the burgers, the pasta, to the turkey meatballs. We went a little crazy on the food size and took some leftovers home but we started off with the grilled caesar salad which was awesome, especially the cornbread croutons. We also did the General Tso's wings which were huge and a full order is 12 for $11 and it comes with wasabi blue cheese which is awesome. For dinner we did the special pasta of the day which came with turkey meatballs, the pasta was awesome and you can definitely tell it's fresh and housemade and the same with the meatballs, they were crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. We also got the Pork Roll burger which is the one that won Serviss the Philly Burger competition and man it's awesome, some serious pork flavor there and the special sauce is great as well. Also got some Blue Duck Fries which are just gluttonous and amazing, fries tossed in duck fat, topped with confit duck, and then topped again with cheese sauce. We did somehow manage to save enough room for dessert which was cheesecake that came in a little jar. It was awesome as well, not overly heavy and rich, it was the perfect way to end the meal. So I have to say this place is a winner and I wish it was closer and I would recommend to anyone, but in the future we will be making reservations, at the counter, so we can hang with Serviss while he's cooking."", ""GREAT PIZZA!!! Super good place to take Vegetarians!   Awesome location in Mid City, right off Canal .Not super big, comes across as a neighborhood joint for sure.   My waiter was great, and super attentive. But the Pizza was Superb. I got an eggplant pizza that was the perfect size for two people. I got it by my lonesome and had to eat it all in one sitting.     I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was great. I got a crab and corn bisque that was more like a corn chowder, but still very delightful. I highly recommend this place, great place if you have family in town!!"", ""Came in at 6:30 pm on Labor Day for dinner on my way home.  We were sat almost instantly and greeted kindly by one of the managers.  Our server was also very friendly and efficient.  In all fairness, it wasn't overly busy, but still there were other customers around.  The menu was great and the food was as well.  The calamari appetizer was wonderful.  My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly to temp.  Salad was very nice as well.  Hubby's seafood platter was pretty nice but he said the fish-n-chips (fish) portion had a different taste, coming off as a little strange to him from what was expected.  Mostly he enjoyed the meal though and was not complaining...only answered me when asked.   The cocktail sauce here is quite tasty as well.   As usual, the Claim Jumper restaurant is beatiful inside and out.    Overall,  we were very pleased with the whole experience."", ""One star for really nice service + no wait (came at an off hour), but this place was the worst meal I had in Nashville. The grits were a massive dissapointment - the cheese wasn't even melted into them, and the pancakes weren't bad, but also weren't better than Ihop...  We couldn't understand the hype and guessed that it maybe has to do with hungover college kids rolling in and appreciating greasy food?"", ""If you have the chance, eat here! Food is fresh and so tasty. Amazing service. I have never done a review on yelp before. May not again but loved this place so much I felt compelled to share."", ""So, I am a repeat offender - and thankfully so.  I decided to share part of my anniversary celebration at EATalia.  Once again, I loved it and so did my spouse!  The service was exceptional, personable and professional.  And the specials were out of this world.  The cost is so fair it's a crime!  I can see this BYOB going pretty far and hope it does.  Frank, you demonstrated why this place is so special.  Thank you!!  And hats off to the Chef and Staff!"", ""Always good food! The grilled fish is one of our favorites!  Prices are reasonable too!"", ""Server was super friendly and nice but after putting in our order, we never saw him for over 30 mins. He came to tell us our food would be out shortly,  that meant another 30 mins, yes it took over an hour for our food to show up. Even then we had to get someone else to bring us forks and napkins, no one even found us knives. Dry chicken in a southwest salad, bland quesadilla,  very average burger but all at higher prices than normal. Asked for hot sauce and server came to table 3 times and made excuses each time of why he did not have with him. He was a trainer and taking care of other servers was more important than taking care of his own customers. Terrible service, bad food,  high prices, i think Jimmy himself would be embarrassed with this place, will never be visiting this chain again just because of this experience."", ""Absolutely delicious. Fresh and flavorful ingredients. Quality atmosphere. Reasonable service. Fantastic selection. Great for lunch or a light dinner."", ""Chink's is probably not the BEST cheese steak I've ever eaten (and I have eaten THOUSANDS) but it is certainly in the top five of all time.   It is unique, somewhere between the Steve's (whole flat slice) and Jim's (chopped to death) presentation.  It works REALLY well, texture-wise.  Liscio's rolls were fresh and shiny, and the Wacky Wednesday deal of a large for six bucks was fortuitous. They usually have SOME kind of deal going though.. Meat was tasty and not gristly, the white American cheese melted like a dream (but short of the sauce that Steve's is.)  I got more meat than my son did, but both were acceptable portions.  Fried onions were 1/4 inch cubes, and caramelized beautifully.   Crinkle cut fries only get so good, but these were pipjng hot, and the Whiz that came on the side worked great on the sammy as well.  Lots of people on Yelp complained about the Whiz, but I could see it along with American as a great combo.Whiz is what Whiz is.  Possibly the REAL best thing here is the 1949 vibe.  This place is a time capsule, where only the prices have changed (and pretty minimally at that) over five decades.  Everything (including real fountain sodas) are made to order. Milkshakes (the half and half was very popular)  were killer.   Waitstaff is attentive and friendly as you are likely to find on the East Coast.  The accents tell you you;re not in Kansas, but the hospitality is sans atty-tude.  It really does transport you to another era,,  We got there 12:30 and were lucky to snag the last open booth.  Full of regulars, with good reason.  Parking is not easy, but there are plenty of side streets, keeping the walk down to an easy block or so.  It was well-worth the 20 minute ride from the Main Line to make this pilgrimage, and it certainly won't be a \""\""one-and-done\""\"" experience.  I usually find some reason or other to venture up route 1 every month or so, and when I do, this will certainly be a set waypoint on my GPS."", ""Very disappointing food.  Too bad I cannot give a minus 1 star. The food was just below average and overpriced. I know Good Peruvian food, I also know a bad imitation trying to pass for decent food. The bad service was also another disappointment. Overall this place gives Peruvian Cuisine a bad name. I will never return or recommend this place."", ""I haven't eaten here in a while because a friend of mines quit, due to rude employers. But I was just starving. I went to order an omelette with the veggies wrapped inside instead of cooked in. I was told that I could not have it that way. Once I asked why??? Both cashiers snapped at me and told me that the cook had the right to make it however he pleased and couldn't I see how busy they were. And they didn't have anytime to special make my order.... After a verbal argument between me and the staff the had to nerve to ask if I still wanted to order. This place has good food but very very poor customer service skills. I will never spend my money there ever again... The worst service I have ever received."", ""This restaurant is on point!!  My husband and I were at the entrance off the lobby just peeking in and one of the managers that was dropping something off stopped us and asked if we wanted to eat.  Only because of her friendly demeanor did we stop and eat.  Love love love this place.  Our waiter, unfortunately cannot remember his name...but he is darling, personable, and wore glasses and was by far the best waiter we have ever had.  The Bloody Mary bar was delish only outdone by the food!!!  OMG!!  Menu was so good and great selection.  The manager on duty came over to greet us and our service dog and told us more about the hotel.  So impressed that we switched our reservations for 2 weeks from Peppeemill to now to staying at Whitney Peaks!!  Keep up the great work and see you in 2 weeks!!!!"", ""I absolutely love this spa. It is my go to place for getting waxed. They are always quick and less painful than other places. Also they offer you tea or cucumber water when you arrive. It is a very serene and enjoyable atmosphere."", ""There's a room here that you've just GOT to see.  I absolutely love the IMA.  Adore it, even.  Remember that campaign they ran a few years ago - \""\""It's MY Art\""\""?  I totally embrace that.  There's truly something for everyone here from the stellar European gallery to the cutting edge contemporary art.  The 100 Acres and outdoor gardens simply can't be missed.  Oh, and don't forget to take a day and visit the Lilly mansion.  It's breathtaking.    Did I mention the best part, yet?  It's all FREE!!!  You get to experience art, and you get to experience art, and YOU get to experience art! (In my Oprah Winfrey Voice, lol)  If you haven't visited the IMA recently, make an effort to go ASAP-tually.  They're open late (until 9) on Thursdays!  Oh, and about that room?  Ask for James Turrell.  It's the ONE piece of art that you actually get to touch. ;-)"", ""We're moving out of Indy in 2 days and Revolucion was a must-try before departing. It was nothing short of phenomenal! Loved the casual, order at the bar environment and simple menu. We had the chips with salsa and guacamole - awesome - and the fish, pork, shrimp, and beef tacos. Yes, they were so good, my husband ate five. Pork and shrimp were our faves but they were all so good it was hard to decide what we liked best. Give this place your business!"", ""It's been 10 years since I've been to a Shoney's, and I'll never eat at a Shoney's again. The people working there are nice and I honestly feel for them. The food was disappointing, though not inedible. The $11.99 buffet is a poor excuse for a buffet, we might have done better to just order something from the menu. I went with my wife and two kids on a Saturday evening and although they didn't appear to be that busy, it took 15 minutes to get a table and another 20 minutes to pay at the counter once we were done eating.   I don't really enjoy eating at Waffle House, but I would have had a much better experience at the Waffle House across Briley  I'm sure."", ""We were looking forward to trying out this newly redone restaurant. The atmosphere is fresh and well done . We were there for breakfast. They now have table service. Things were great until the food came out. My pancakes tasted like stale bread.  My wife's eggs were cold. The potatoes were not cooked. They brought the wrong side dishes. For silverware, we were given  forks but no knives. It took a while to find a waiter to get the silverware we needed. We did speak to the manager. She offered a discount of $2.50  not that we were looking one, but why bother?). However, she did not remove the extra charge for the incorrect side dish we didn't order ($4.00).  She did apologize for the food verbally but somehow we were made to feel like she couldn't care less. I don't write many reviews unless I really love something or dislike something. This restaurant fits into the latter category. Sorry. A nice decor is not enough."", ""When I called she put me on hold 3 times. Was very rude. Then when delivery came received wrong order. She wouldn't fix this, and hung up on me 3 times. Very rude and horrible service. Don't go there""]",17
1,"[""After a 90-min wait (we were told it would be an hour), I went for dinner with my sisters. The food was just okay and over-priced. The polenta wasn't the best I've had, the cheese empanadas were not empanadas but rather fried little puff balls (and if they're going to be vegetarian, there should more more, not less of the meat ones), the cauliflower was pretty good but again, not worth the price.   But let me tell you about our service! First the server brought out the wrong wine for my sisters (they got a red cab Mendoza, a white Chardonnay was delivered). Nobody really checked on us except to ask if we wanted to order more food. Then! One of my sisters PULLED A REALLY LONG HAIR OUT OF HER MOUTH AFTER TAKING A BITE OF FOOD!!!!!!!! When we alerted our server, his response was, \""\""ew, I'll be sure to tell the chef.\""\""  NEVER did we get an apology, nor was the item replaced nor taken off the check!!!!! And on top of that, he charged us for the red AND the white wine!!!!! The sister who had the hair is super polite and it was impressive that she even alerted him of the hair, so unfortunately she did not fight to have the item taken off, regardless of my urging her to do so. Alas, I decided to share this review. That hair was LONG AND NASTY!   No way will I return. What a shame."", ""Awful.  Ordered online via  From You Flowers.  What I paid for was a premium bouquet which should have had a minimum of 8 lavender roses in it but what they delivered had just four pink ones and a whole bunch of greenery.  The vase was not what I ordered either - they substituted something very different.  This was a birthday bouquet for a friend who just found out about having breast cancer and I really wanted to cheer her up with a nice bouquet. This shop couldn't be more disappointing."", ""Not very good. No salami. Boiled ham instead of baked. No salami. More like a Miami Cuban. This is Tampa. They're in the middle of a Hispanic area so you'd expect they'd do it right. Nope. Never again."", ""We love makiman. It's one of the best low key sushi places in center city. Their food is always fresh and it's nice it's a BYO if you want to get out for a bit. Their delivery is always on time and they're priced well."", ""I can't believe I have to give a star.

The food is amazing, the ambiance is classic Santa Barbara-style, and there always seems to be a lot of locals, which is a good sign.

Best dessert on the planet!!!"", ""Despite a recent renovation, the Black Sheep is dingy and dirty and the sloppiest, most unattractive hostess (that is until I saw our waitress) sat us at our table upstairs. Although it was 10 pm on a Wednesday night, she was hesitant about sitting a party of two at a large table. Perhaps she was expecting a sudden stream of late night diners. The waitress was as sloppy and disheveled as the hostess. No makeup, no hairstyle and clothes that looked as though she found them on the street. I ordered something from the menu that did not have goat cheese listed as one of its ingredients, but she argued with me that the menu did have it listed. I showed her the menu and corrected her. She was rude and had a nasty attitude. I guess I would too if I looked like her. It was $30 for a burger, a salad and two Diet Cokes.The staff is arrogant, the place is filthy and the food is perfect for those who don't care about their health or appearance and like to stuff their faces with a bunch of high fat, high cholesterol, high calorie greasy food.

Everyone just kept walking by our table and ignored us. After 15 min, my husband flagged someone down.  Host came over, apologized and got our drinks.   Food- Definitely not worth the ridiculous prices.  My shrimp cocktail was so tough I couldn't chew it.  Scallops were ok but definitely not the best I ever had and not at all worth the price $32.  It was served with some watery cauliflower that they called \""\""pur\u00e9ed.\""\""  My husbands $42 filet mignon was a piece of tasteless, stringy meat.

He simply said no and walked away. Furnishings look so dated including the fake fish tank on the big \""\""gold\""\"" wall!  Will not return. For those kind of prices there are soooo many better restaurants."", ""I am writing this based on the concert/bar only.  We went to the Eddie Money concert and chose the General Admission tickets.  The VIP seats appeared to be very well placed for viewing.  Unless you arrive at least an hour early and wait at the rail constantly, or you are well over 6 ft, you will have a hard time seeing anything.  The stage is raised above the VIP crowd nicely, but appears to be level with the G/A crowd.  This leaves over 90% of the General Admission patron with a very 'limited view'.

He told me a coworker took his car to p/u his/her daughter from school. That's a new one. So as you see, 2 hour delay does not = a $7 gratuity, nor does it = more than 1 star."", ""My go-to for pizza in the montgomeryville/chalfont area!

Should have went with my first choice instead of here."", ""Ordered pizza and tipped a buck. Made wrong pizza...waited...made another wrong pizza...girl talked to manager and walked into back room with pizza and suddenly came out with the right sauce and already had cheese already on it. Don't know what happened in the back room but I thought they were supposed to make it in front of you. Then they treated me like I was the asshole."", ""Quite disappointed - not in the chain, but certainly in this location. This is the third time in a row we've had problems with our meal. The last caused us not to come back for over a year - and we should have stayed away.  On this Sunday evening, the restaurant was busy, but not jammed. There were five in our party, and we continually had to remind our server about things we were missing before our meals even arrived - butter, silverware sets, refills on beverages...   I ordered a 13oz ribeye, rare, with only squash from the mixed vegetables. When it arrived 20 minutes later, the uneven piece of meat was medium rare on the thick end, and medium to well the rest of the cut - and I had a full serving of mixed vegetables with only one piece of squash. The manager took it to recook the order - and brought back a piece of meat so rare it was cold in the center and tough. I was hungry, so I chomped my way through.  Another steak was over-cooked, a third plate was missing sour cream and butter for a potato, cold shrimp on a fourth, and almost raw (crunchy) vegetables on the fifth.  The manager (Cody) apologized when he took my plate, but never checked back to see if my issue was resolved and for us to tell him about the other problems at the table. When the check arrived - full price. No offer of a dessert for the issues, nothing off the bill.  We will not be back. Jesse's is just a bit up the road, and the quality of both the food and the service are head and shoulders above this Outback.  One shout-out - Kate was great in helping to resolve issues, but she was tied up training someone else and we didn't see her again."", ""Abysmal customer service. Came in on Wednesday at 6ish (not busy), ordered a meatball sub from some short white dude. He insisted that meatball subs only get three meatballs and when I challenged him and inquired as to why that was he got very rude very quickly. As my sub was in the oven I decided to look up subway's website and, lo and behold, meatball subs DO get four meatballs, just like every other time I have gotten a sub from that store. When I informed him of this and asked for another meatball he stomped over, smashed two more meatballs into my sandwich, and snippily finished the order even after I informed him I didn't want to cause any trouble.  There are some wonderful people who work at this Subway. That guy was not one of them and the experience was enough to put me off that store completely. I'm not expecting five star service from a Subway but when you try to take advantage of your customers and then get angry when they call you out on it, maybe you aren't meant for a job that involves customer interaction. Will not be returning to this store ever again."", ""Do not waste your time ordering take out.  Ive waited over an hour and received the wrong order twice now.

It was really enjoyable and definitely challenging. In December, emails about fraud, theft, employees leaving started coming.  My husband and I had purchased, but didn't get to use yet, 10 classes each for $85.  The new owners wouldn't recognize the 10 classes, but we can each have $85 credit. I was told we had till the end of Feb to covert the credit to classes but the owner said I may want to wait, as she offers specials in February.  I email this week about a deal they have for 5 classes for $47. I get an email back that I can't use the credits for special deals.  What??? I just want to use my credits, and walk away. It doesn't seem to me that this place is fixed at all. There are plenty of places in Philadelphia where I can work out and not have to worry about all this drama. The workout is a 4-5 star.

I should have gotten a clue based on the fact that I went there with a group of 8 people on a Saturday night and there were NO other customers in the restaurant. Needless to say, I ignored the signs and ate here.  This was literally the worst Thai food I have had in my entire life.    First, I ordered the tom yum soup.  They asked me how spicy I wanted it and I responded that I wanted it spicy.  I did not expect that the entire bowl of soup would be covered in red pepper flakes.  Disgusting. I spent ten minutes picking red pepper flakes out of the soup and my mouth.      I also tried the chicken satay.  The chicken was ice cold and as dry as beef jerky. The dipping sauce was a mix between curry and Planter's honey roasted peanuts.  It was a bizarre combination like nothing I've ever had before.  Once again...Disgusting.     Finally, I ordered curry.  I had high hopes that they could not screw up everything in my order.  Boy was I wrong.  The curry was bland and just plain gross.   Overall, all 8 of the people in my group left the restaurant dissatisfied. My recommendation is that you walk two blocks down the road and eat at the Blue Elephant Thai Restaurant."", ""Staff was very nice and helpful but we were extremely disappointed with the food.

We asked for a table that would accomdate three people and not involve eating with someone's large back at our very tiny table.  We were rudely informed that it was a take or leave it situation.

He didn't even try to ask me any specific questions to see if it's me (ID #, weight, etc) he just singled me out of my group of 15+ people like an as*hole.

Of course it was all wrong cheese everywhere charged for the nacho cheese no soft taco and the young lady who took our order tried to argue with us saying \""\""you didn't say that\""\"" last time I checked the customer is always right.

You can select from beef, seafood or mixed meats (seafood & beef), mushroom, and just plain.  They can adjust the spice as needed too.  I always get the extra hot with the hot temperature, can't beat it.  The rice also comes in a dol-sot which is great if you leave it in for a while, it burns the rice into a nice crispy shell.

We then sat for over 10 minutes NOT getting acknowledged, NOT being spoken too, and we knew we had been seated at a table where the person was on break.  After almost 15 minutes we decided to just walk out.  I went up to the manager and told him we were leaving and why.  He asked us to stay, said it was his fault, and said he would pay for our meal.  No thanks.  Not staying under those conditions.  We were disgusted with the staff there.  At one point while we were sitting there, we saw 5 waitresses all gathered around the register with the manager just talking.  I guess they figured we would sit there waiting on that waitress to come back off break.  We left, and went to the other Joe's on Dean Road.  Much better staff there, and a whole diff atmosphere.

My girlfriends and I wanted to have a nice meal to bring in 2010. I thought I did my research--read reviews, got a recommendation from a local, and thought the online menu looked good.  When I called to make a reservation I had a lovely conversation with the owner--another confirmation that I had made the right choice.  Well, I couldn't have been more wrong.  My girlfriends and I got dressed up, made our way to the restaurant, and the second we walked in, I knew it was a mistake.  It was too cold to sit outside (which was beautiful), and so we went into the brightly lit indoor part of the restaurant, surveyed the scene and realized that we were the youngest people there by at least 40 years (and we are in our 30s).  The \""\""Latin jazz\""\"" band was little more than forgettable background music, which did absolutely nothing to help the vibe.  There was no vibe.  The restaurant lacked energy, the wait staff were professional, but not personable, and the food was incredibly disappointing.  We knew we would be paying a lot (total 100.00 each) for a price fixe New Year's Eve dinner--and I have no problem spending that if the food is amazing, and the experience is unforgettable. As soon as we sat down we started to be served, the wait staff, highly attentive, perhaps because all of the food was already prepared in the back, not many people were there, and they wished they didn't have to work on New Year's Eve.  It was too much.  We got our drinks (mediocre mojitos) and immediately were served our appetizers, which made it hard to enjoy our drinks.  We could not languish over any of our dishes, but perhaps this was better, because the food was absolutely terrible.  I can only speak to what I ordered--it was the New Year's Eve price fixe, and apparently there was a guest chef that night, but I couldn't eat the majority of it.  The empanadas were OK; the soup was fine; I had a salad that had some kind of tangy dressing that I couldn't bear to put in my mouth.  The main dish I ordered was fish and it was served in tin foil.  I understand if it was cooked this way, but to serve it on a plate, with sides on the outside of the tin foil, made no sense to me.  In the end, it didn't even matter because the fish had absolutely no taste.  We ended up leaving before the clock struck 12:00--none on us wanted to start 2010 in a place that was bland, vibe-less, and forgettable.  I understand that this night may have been different from other nights, but it literally left a bad taste in my mouth and I will not return there nor recommend it to others."", ""I've only been to Lex one time but I had the time of my life.

I walked over and asked for a 5 minute extension even offering more money for the courteous extension to finish our round.  I was then directed to the bartender who said he would do this, great!  While we waited for our match to come back online, someone came over and told my me and my fiancee to get off our seats because another group was coming. Of course we don't mind moving and sharing space once the other group gets there but there was aggression in his tone.

After several minutes our scores disappeared, and I went to check in on the extra time still thinking this should be a simple fix and in good spirits.  I was told by the person I originally asked that he was too busy and that I should have talked to him when it first happened (this is the same person I initially talked to who redirected me to the bartended) because our scores are gone. He then redirected me to the owner who irritably said you're scores are gone, you can buy another hour if you want.

It's the tour guides at the plantation that are So Great!   This company has POOR time management issue!   After being picked up, we waited for about 20min to wait for the other bus to come then about 20 people were transferred to our bus. By the time we really started the tour, it was an hour after the pick up time.   Payment issue - I called about the discount I'll get if I reserve online. The woman told me to do it otherwise I can't get it when paying in person. So I did it. But, then the driver, half way into the tour, said now everyone please line up to pay. He used a tiny portable credit card machine to process everyone's card. It was slow  SLOW! The bus was full that day and it was 90 degrees out. It took him about 45min to get everything done plus he was confused about two groups of people who happened to have the same last name.   Really? It's 2013 people! The company can't take payment online or over the phone?  Why ask your customer to waste valuable time?   Though I had the email proving I've paid online. I was told that it simply reserved my seats and wasn't the actual payment. So paid AGAIN and of course got charged TWICE! It has been over a week and I haven't got the refund.   Because of this delay, when we got to the second plantation, we had about a little over an hour left because the driver said we  must leave at 5.    He told us to go straight to the big house but gave us the WRONG time when the tour would start. So everyone waited about 15 minutes in line AGAIN instead of just enjoying the beautiful garden at Oak Alley. (The tour is boring and the stories aren't interesting. I'd recommend people just spend all the time in the garden) By the time we came out, it was almost time to get on the bus and head back to the French Quarter. So Disapppinting.

It was an hour and a half+ before I got my order.   I was looking forward to a large arugula salad with chicken and the other items, instead I got a small bowl of cold noodles with a little arugula and cold chicken. It was awful and a waste of money.

4,"[""My girlfriend and I decided to try Kalamata's last night at around 7:30. The guy at the counter asked us if we're ready to order even before we had the chance to look at the menu properly, not once but multiple times.   We ordered 2 lamb gyros, a side order of roasted potatoes and the tabouleh. The potatoes came out extremely fast and were lukewarm at best. Either they were premade, and \""\""microwaved to order\""\"" or were just sitting on a hot plate. Not something I'd expect from any restaurant.   The tabouleh was SOUR - like salad dunked in a bottle of fish sauce sour. We decided to tell the guy upfront our issues with the tabouleh but all we got out of him was \""\""This is our recipe. This is the way we make it. It's fine if you don't like it, but this is how we make it\""\"". I agree I have no idea what authentic tabouleh tastes like, or how to make it, but I have tasted GOOD tabouleh in the past, and this was far from it. I pity the people who've eaten tabouleh only at this establishment because they're really missing out.   The gyros were pedestrian at best, under-seasoned and most of all under-sauced. The veggies were on one side of the pita, the meat on the other - so you'd never get a mouthful of veggies+meat and only one side of the pocket had the sauce. Suspecting another \""\""This is how we sauce our gyros. This is our recipe\""\"" moment, we decided to finish our food ASAP.  Finally, the worst offense was that the guy starts closing up shop while we're still eating. Really? I've no idea how this place got 4 stars on yelp, but there are way better restaurants in Nashville for Mediterranean food."", ""I received a vase of flowers for Mother's Day and they are terrible.

They forgot the candy that came with it and had to deliver it later in the day. Look elsewhere if you are looking to send an impressive gift, because this one was not."", ""Lame waitress!  I came to watch 10 mins of a game before catching my train. The bartender asked if I wanted a drink. I said no, just catching the game. He was cool. The bar was barely 1/3 rd full and slow.  So I quietly sat at a high top and a waitress came by and asked if I wanted a drink. I said I had a train in 10 mins etc. She said I couldn't sit there and had to leave the bar.  Huh? I looked around and saw half of her high top tables were empty.  I was dressed like the other patrons and was about to leave anyway.  I said why? I'm not taking someone's seat. She got prissy and said they were the rules. Really??? I get it if it's busy. Or if you have a homeless person stinking up the bar. But seriously, I'm just some dude sitting there quietly who's about to leave. That's an issue? Will be avoiding this bar for 2015."", ""Worst movie theater around!  I am within walking distance and avoid this theater.  I'd rather drive out of town then waste my money going here.   Today I decided to give them another try only because there was a free screening being offered.  Gofobo apparently rents space to do screenings at Loews.  I understand it is a separate company.  I understand that they are not affiliated but when you rent space to a company that poorly runs events at your facility it is a reflection on your business as well.  That aside, a little courtesy and  goes a long way.  I do not understand why people with no customer service skills decide to work in a service industry.  How they become managers is also a mystery.   Gofobo offered a free screening at Loews today.  The representative stated that over 500 tickets were issued for the screening.  As a matter of fact, while I was at the theater I was able to see that tickets were still being offered online.  However, after a 1 hour wait (longer for many others) we were told that the theater was full. I do not remember the exact number but the theater held less than 200!  Less than 200 yet over 500 tickets were given out!    Here is where I have an issue with Loews.  I asked to see the theater manager.  I was upset that I had wasted my day.  I had gotten a baby sitter for my infant son and planned to have a day with my daughter.  We went out in the rain expecting to see a movie and after waiting in a line for an hour while peoples purses were searched and a few people were let in at a time we were then told the theater was full.  We were told to leave our email address and we would be issued tickets for a future screening.  I waited for a manager.  What a waste.  The manager, \""\""Nicole\""\"" was very rude.  All she needed to say was, \""\""I am very sorry.  I understand\""\"".  Instead she stared at me and only said, \""\""OK\""\"" in response to everything I said to her.  No Nicole, it is not OK.  It is not okay that my time was wasted.  If you couldn't offer to let us into a different movie how about at least offering some empathy and simply saying I am sorry for the confusion then pass the blame onto Gofobo.  I feel sorry for your staff.  I hope you do not treat them as poorly as you treat customers!  Time to brush up on your customer service skills!  You really do not belong working in management in the service industry.    My past experiences with Loews have been poor.  We were there a few months ago and it was gross.  The floors and cup holders were sticky.  Food spilled everywhere.  The bathrooms were also gross.  This was the second bad experience in a row.  I had said then that I would not be back.  The only reason I gave them another try was because it was a free screening.  In the future, free wont even get me to go back there.  They have permanently lost this family as customers."", ""Dreadful place. Nice products, but not worth the constant glaring and staring.

It was my first time coloring my hair, and she did a great job explaining every step to me and recommending products that would keep it looking great.  Oh yeah, and the color is beautiful!  During my shampoo and haircut, two other stylists mentioned how great the color turned out, which made me feel like a rockstar.  =)  She also gave me a nice blowout -- Unfortunately it was raining profusely when I left, so it didn't last long, but I have to admit that my hair has never looked so good after running through a storm.

Obviously this accusation was complete BS. I can only assume the bouncers hater homies were not happy at all on the crowd of girls who circled up around me when I started getting down.

Fine. However, the rolls ended up being crammed into the bottom of a larger bag with our original order crammed on top.  7 the clerk then darted to the back to get us utensils, which for some bizarre reason took another 5 minutes.

5,"[""Myself and a family member went into Table Talk to purchase a new living room table about a month ago, the table was one from reclaimed Indian Teak, and we were very excited about the table! After speaking to the owners, managers, and a few employees they loved the idea of the table. We got a great deal, paid the down, and waited the 4 weeks to hear back from them saying that our order was in and ready to be delivered.  Then the phone rang. It was the owner (I cannot remember his name, he was an older gentlemen), and told us that they couldnt get the base of the table, and wouldnt be able to put the table together. He said that they could still sell us the top of the table, but there would be no discount. We were rather confused about the request, and politely declined to purchase the table from them at that point. Back to the drawing board!  So, we did some research and found the table from their vendor through a friend who purchases wholesale furniture. The cost was the same that they charged us from the wholesale vendor, that Table Talk wanted to charge us! Now, that doesnt make much economic sense to us.   In conclusion, we found it odd that they would 1. Lie to us, saying that they couldnt get the table, when they just mischarged us, 2. Attempted to scam us out of the difference in cash instead of just taking the loss on their business, and 3. That they would so disregard the common good practices of business.

Always full of druggies, weirdos, creeps, panhandlers and the worst deli staff ever."", ""I have been to The Blind Tiger on multiple occasions for everything from business meetings to pleasure like this morning. It has a great atmosphere inside and is in a convenient location. And after this mornings experience, along with multiple subpar visits, I had to write a review. The staff's attitude is always hit or miss on whether or not they are having a good day. I walked in this morning about 30 minutes after opening. It was quiet inside because it is an early Sunday morning. I said good morning to the girl who looked like she was mad at the world. Okay, we all have bad days and this wasn't the first time experiencing this there so I blew it off. I stated that I wanted my order to go and order two drinks. I asked about a pastry which was told it was a guava and cheese (one of my favorites) so I ordered one of those too. I sitting outside and walked back in after a few minutes to check on my order. I saw that the pastry was boxed up (which I appreciate the personal touch of their logo on the box) and then was told my first drink was ready. It wasn't in a to go cup so it had to be fixed. Instead of the barista handing it to me at the counter where I grabbed the pastry and was waiting, maybe three feet from the barista, she made me walk down to her to grab the cup instead of her walking to me. I walked back outside to wait on my second order, came back in a few minutes later to my next drink just being finished. I told the barista that the drink looked beautiful from the design she made on top and got zero response. And no have a good day, thank you, nothing. Instead the ladies were talking about what food they wanted to eat. Again, I was the only one who they were waiting on because it was a Sunday morning. I left and began drinking my coffee and it wasn't hot and my boyfriend's wasn't either, but it wasn't worth going back after all of that. And to top it all off, when I got home to eat the pastry, it didn't have any cheese in it and barely any guava and I threw part of it away. What blows my mind even more is that they hold training classes for those who want to learn more about coffee. They should focus more on making sure their staff is performing up to expectations as today they failed in almost every way possible."", ""First know that the shop works by appointment only.   Don't find out the hard way like I did.  Even though I arrived while Jack was there he told me both that he closes at 5 and works by appointment only.  I guess he has more customers than he needs.  I won't be one of them."", ""I had gotten a strawberry banana smoothie right before my airplane. I drank almost the whole thing but started to feel my stomach getting uneasy. The next day woke up with food poisoning from this smoothie. Everyone stay away if you don't want to get sick!!"", ""I was in town for business and after checking into my hotel, I searched for the closest BBQ place. I wasn't sure what I'd find at Hendricks but I was pleasantly surprised as I was driving through the neighborhood. I liked the small town feel. Since I was by myself, I had planned on taking it to go and eating at the hotel but after walking inside, I had to stay to enjoy the decor. Light bulbs in mason jars, flat screen TV's and an amazing lighted patio. Although the view is just a parking lot, it's too bad it wasn't closer to the river behind it or had something else to look at.   I ordered pork steak (which I've never heard of before) and it was really good. It looked like a T-bone but was tender enough to be cut with a fork. For my sides, I chose collard greens and cole slaw. The cole slaw was awesome. I have a weird ritual where I always order the cole slaw at different places to see how they make it. This one is definitely in my top 5. The slaw was finely chopped and had ground pepper in it, which I love. I usually put black pepper in my slaw anyways but this one was perfect. Cold and with a kick. Collard greens with a bit of bacon in it was good too. If I had more time or with a group of friends, I'd definitely come back because everything looked comfortably country."", ""I went when they first opened and I didn't want to judge too harshly because it's a new place. I waited several weeks to try again, even worse!! We came for a show with a band and sat at a high top table by the bar. Nobody came by to say hi or ask about drinks. We waited 15 minutes and still not service, I get it, it's busy. So I go to the bar. The bartender is busy with other guest, she says she will be right with me, 15 mins later still haven't been helped. The manager is very present and visible the whole time.  He is yelling at servers and comparing about not doing their jobs. But he doesn't even notice that I have not been helped yet. Finally another bartender helps me and I walk my drinks back to my party. Still nobody has come by our table. We were there for a while and no server has come by and the manager was very oblivious to our distaste or the fact we needed help. On top of that, there was crazy feedback on the music and you couldn't even hear the singing. We finished our beers and went elsewhere. Very disappointing."", ""Amazing. We had; Steak Tartare, Caribbean Seafood Pepper Pot and the Curried Goat. Everything was really wonderful. Tartare maybe the best i've had. The goat with the sweet curry and gnocchi was very different and I loved it. I had a bite of the lime cheesecake and it was top notch, too.   No drinks, because it's 2 days after Mardi Gras and I'm still in recovery mode. The service was among the best I've had in this town, which is know for it's hospitality industry. Great great great!"", ""Omg. Don't go here....waited and waited for my food .

Went to that room and it smelled so bad!  Asked for another room and that room smelled as well.  Not that clean, bathroom was old.  Not a place you wanna stay at.

But this very small bouquet had only three roses that never opened and wilted within two days. The rest of the arrangement was cheap filler flowers.

Terrible service,  when I tried to call and cancel service  all I got was a message telling me that lines were busy.  Least 5 of their cabs drove by where I was waiting,  and none stopped.  Luckily I found me another way to my destination.  Will NEVER  use this company again.!!!!"", ""I should have known it would be a bad experience from the beginning. The chips tasted stale and the salsa tasted like ketchup. Old el paso salsa from the jar would have been better. The guacamole lacked flavor, I suggest they add some cumin. The enchiladas tasted like they had Vodka sauce on them and the onions inside tasted like they weren't cooked. The tacos had cabbage on them.  The best part of the meal was the margarita. The strawberry margarita was really good.  The gentleman collecting the plates dropped a dirty knife on my cream colored shirt. I didn't say anything, we just got the check and left. We will not be returning."", ""Will not return. Have given this location numerous second chances for improved customer service, but have observed no positive changes.

This location is a complete disappointment and in need of a serious management overhaul."", ""WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!! Originally ordered rolls to go, asked to double check and they yelled at us for just wanting to make sure if we had all the rolls we ordered. After we left, we found out we were missing not 2 rolls like last time, but 4!! so we called back, asked to speak with the owner. We got on the phone supposedly with their manager, and the manager said he would give us a gift card for next time we came. Don't you think I should get my food that I already paid for? why do I have to wait til next time to get reimbursed for what I should have already gotten. The \""\""manager\""\"" said the owner wasn't there but later when we asked if we could talk to him, the same \""\""manager\""\"" turned into the owner. Then the \""\""Manger/owner\""\"" hung up on us for trying to figure out how to fix the situation. I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN.

If your idea of a \""\""Special Night\""\"" out involves sitting in the dirt on tree stumps watching LA poseurs vaping after all-day wine binging sounds fun, this is your kinda place. Their walk-in hut offers beer only, no place inside to sit and relax. The outdoor BBQ sandwiches feed the crowd as they stare at the road to see who arrives next. The band was good, but were crammed into a corner of the dirt, near the beer hut with no dance floor.The only place of solace is the Tavern itself, and a charming respite from the outside. My ribs were tasty, but my husband's fish entre was a big disappointment. The servers were tense feeding the crowd on a holiday weekend. In short, I will never be back.

But they still screwed it up!  The doanir's came with lettuce and a dusting of donair meat. We asked for extra sweet sauce and we still had to look for any sauce at all!

I'll have to admit I didnt care for some of the beverages I tasted but I didnt not like them either. My fiance and I were actually fortunate to partake of their 5 year celebration the day we came to visit them.

The waitress did offer another choice and we will see how that is later as after being there over 1 hr we brought home.  The owners or managers only seem to care if a substitute was made and who was your server but not that the kitchen staff is being overworked with this crowd and cannot be attentive to their cooking when being pushed like this.  The first manager pushed me to second manager and they really don't seem to care as long as they can push the crowd to fill the tables.

Well, that is my last visit here as I would rather go up the street to a smaller diner (Club Diner) and get a better meal and more attentive staff."", ""Do not stay here!    We had a very bad experience with this hotel.  Let me start by saying that we reserved a room for our wedding night.  The next morning we had a very early flight to Montego Bay so we checked out of our room around 5:30 a.m. the next morning.  We actually had no complaints until we tried to use our debit card on a large purchase in Jamaica on our honeymoon and it was denied.  OK, this special time that only happens once in your life.... was completely ruined because this hotel charged our account 3 TIMES for the room amount at a whopping $240 a pop. We only left a small amount in our checking account because we were travelling out of country (just in case something happened and someone got our card number or something).  After getting charged $19.99 per MB to check our bank account using data on my cell phone, we discovered this MESS that Courtyard put us in.    We had planned on a couple's massage by the beach in Jamaica but that couldn't happen!  Plans on our honeymoon were ruined and I am still very upset!!!  After getting back into the states on a Saturday evening, I called the hotel to try and figure out what as going on.  I was told that a manager would have to speak with me and she would not be in until Tuesday.  I was forwarded to her voicemail and left a message.  The manager finally got back with me and she stated that she had no idea what was going on.  I explained to her my process through booking: I am a Marriott Rewards Member so I just logged into my account and booked a room.  After realizing that I would not be about to check into the room at check in since our wedding was at 4pm I called the hotel and added my husband to the account so that he could check into the room.  I also asked about how much the deposit for the room would be since Marriott usually charges a deposit in case of any charges.  The lady told me that it varies per hotel and I told her that I needed to know (since we were only transferring a certain amount into our checking).  She called the hotel and then finally got back on the line with me... she said that the deposit would not be more than $50.  When he went to check in he told them he wasn't sure what name the reservation was under it could have been either one of our last names. They found the reservation and got him checked in.  We checked out at 5:30 a.m. the next morning and that was all we knew.  The manager had then figured out what had happened: They created a new reservation for my husband and then charged me for a NO SHOW on my reservation.  The third charge was the pre-authorization that showed $220!  Let me re-cap:  They charged me 2 TIMES FOR THE ROOM and screwed up the check in.  THEN... they neglected to let us know that the pre-authorization and the room cost would be charged in the same amount on the same day of check in!  They also charged us for parking!  We had already parked our car in a parking garage and did not park with them!   The manager acted as if it was my husbands fault for creating a new reservation.   I assured her that he absolutely knew that we had a reservation and wouldn't have created a new reservation that it must have been her staff that messed up!    She credited my account for the no-show, told me that the pre-authorization takes 7 business days to fall off of the account, and then credited me for the parking.  She did credit back all fraudulent charges to our account!  However, she can never replace what we lost on our honeymoon all because of their screw ups and neglect in informing us about the pre-authorization and room charge on the same day!  (Basically it showed up twice in one day right after another... which makes no sense... usually a pre-authorization is charged to hold the money and then the balance is updated... like when you leave a tip at a restaurant... not two separate charges!).  Ridiculous!!"", ""Terrible customer service.  My friends got me a gift certificate for a massage here for my birthday. I said WOW awesome let me try this place out. I called to schedule my appointment and the lady who helped me on the phone was not very helpful... First off I'm sorry if i work 9-5 and ask for Saturdays or evening hours. Her snide remarks and attitude were just unacceptable. I didn't get her name but she was so darn rude.  Yes I understand Saturdays book up pretty far in advance but not even a \""\""we can take your number down so if something opens up before the 8-10 weeks out  we can contact you\""\"".    overall I'm not impressed. if it wasn't for the fact that my name is on my gift certificate I would totally have re-gifted this.

We moved to the other side of the restaurant (still outside) and the kids made there way over to us and continued playing. We couldnt get away. We went to a table inside. Food was terrible.

I finally get in touch with someone on Wednesday and they have yet to look at my car. The appraisal states the work is to take 1 day to complete. They proceed to tell me it will be next week before I, might, have my car back. I get that hundreds of people had damage to their vehicles when my was damaged. However, this does not provide an excuse for poor customer service.

The reviews seemed okay and everyone said that the drinks were really good.   Not at all true....  To start with, we ordered the guacamole. I have had a lot of different kinds and make it myself at home, and this was incredibly bland with not a lot of flavor.  I ordered the Carnitas Tacos and my boyfriend got the Brisket Tacos (special of the day). They were all right, but the waiter told us right off the bat he would recommend a side since they were small portions.  We didn't end up eating any of our side since they were so big, we each only finished two tacos!   The most disappointing part of this whole experience was the drinks.  I got the Classic Mojito (which I have also had and made many times before) and he got the Mexican style Mojito, that apparently is with cilantro and tequilla instead of rum and mint.  The first batch were really delicious, so we ordered another round. Not at ALL the same drink.  They looked very different, but mainly they didn't taste at all similar.  Very very sweet and acidic, way too bitter.  We politely called the waiter over and asked if the bartender wouldn't mind remaking them since the first drinks we had were very different, and he obliged. A few seconds later the bartender came back and told us she remade the drinks but tasted them and they tasted exactly how they should be.  She was very condescending and rude (My boyfriend and I have both worked in customer service before...when customers are being polite in their complaints, there is no need to be rude back) and said she would make the drink for us 10 times if we wanted but it wouldn't be any different. She said that they first AMAZING drink we had must have been made wrong.  She kept asking us how they were different and we had trouble explaining to her exactly what to change, so we decided to let it go and asked for the check. Yes, we still got charged for the shitty drinks that we left on our table.   For a tequilla bar who is apparently known for their drinks, the inconsistency is frightening.

I have never had the pain tolerance to remove everything I really wanted to...I have tried, but usually ended up brusied and crying and not well groomed.

I was really looking forward to trying this place since people rave about how good the wings are and the great Tuesday night specials. I was coming from work so I arrived a few minutes after my party. The restaurant was half-empty when I arrived and there was no one waiting in line, so I went to my friends' table where their food had just arrived. That's when I was informed by the waitress that I couldn't sit down.  The manager came over and explained the policy of \""\""no add-ons\""\"" to a table, and the waitress offered me one of the (many) empty tables, where I would be \""\""allowed\""\"" to sit BY MYSELF, as if I was some kind of pariah. My friends were aghast and we explained that we'd never been to Wings before, and they would never have invited me if they'd known I wouldn't be allowed to join them.  I said I understood the policy for busy nights, and in the future we'd certainly abide by it, but since there was no one waiting for a table it couldn't hurt for me to sit down.  Then the owner came over and very rudely said, \""\""Fine, you can sit down. But you have to pay full price for wings, no special for you.\""\"" He and the manager were glaring at me, totally unsympathetic. I've never felt so insulted, and never before experienced this sort of treatment from a restaurant. It pretty much ruined my day.  To the owner of Wings: I was the nicely-dressed young lady that you turned away, and I'll be telling everyone I know how you made me feel and to avoid your establishment in the future."", ""Got the special--mole chicken.

I changed my apartment within the Lincoln Green as the water from the yard had destroyed the wall. The wall was wet for 3-4 month and the management failed fix it regardless of multiple inquiries. Finally they offered me to move to another apartment and did not compensate for the time and moving expenses. They did not even decrease the rate of the new apartment at least to the rate that I had been paying for the old one.   2. My expensive bicycle was stolen from the second floor balcony. All my attempts to ask for reasonable increased security in the community was useless.   3. When my rent was over, I washed the carpets and had one of the office employees come to inspect the apartment and sign off on my lease termination. I had about 100 Dollars security deposit that I never received back and because of my busy schedule, I did not really care to follow. However, a few years after, I noticed a \""\""Collection Notice\""\"" on my credit report. As I investigated that, I realized that the Lincoln Green Apartment had reported me to Collection Agency for what they said \""\""  150 Dollars fee for not washing the carpet\""\"". They had never contacted me although they had my new address, email, and phone number. They reported me to collection agency for only 50 dollars. When I contacted them, I faced bunch of rude people with no respect, what so ever, to a customer. As soon as they realized that I am not looking for rent, they hung up the phone on me.   4. If you walk (not jump) in your apartment or watch TV after 9 pm, don't be surprised to get a knock on the door by your neighbors.   Two of my friends who also lived in Lincoln Green Apartments had similar experience.  I strongly discourage renting the Lincoln Green Apartments for the following reasons:   1. Disrespectful and rude employees and managers 2. Their abuse of having the SSN of the tenants. 3. Their inadequate care for apartment issues 4. Poor security.  5.

I feel horrible for about 70% of the people that came to watch the show, there is really no good seat in the house. Also their security is absolutely horrible, they were constantly rushing through the crowds to stop people from smoking or taking pictures. When they weren't shoving you to get through they were shining a flashlight in your eyes. We also had security shove us out of the way so he could stand in front of us and take video himself of the band that was playing. They are so unprofessional and rude. If you plan on going to see a show here, I wouldn't recommend it especially if there's going to be a lot of people and a sold-out show because chances are you won't see anything.

My friends tend to struggle with being on time and there is a policy that everyone has to be there to be seated.  The policy makes sense and I was open to the hostess that we were at fault for not all being there.   My friends didn't all show up until 10:40.  There was no table available which was fine since we were late.  But I was not okay with the hostess rudeness towards us.  She told us that we never did the call ahead despite the verified text from the restaurant saying we called ahead on my friend's phone.  We let that comment go since we were taking ownership that we were not all there on time.  She told us that the wait would be about 30-45 minutes and they will text us when the table is open.  She told us to go walk around since there was a farmers market happening close by the restaurant.  She also reminded us that the whole party had to be here.  I don't mind the reminder but again her tone was rude towards us.  We let it go again because we were at fault for our struggle with timeliness.

Her time said we arrived there six minutes after the text.  Okay this means... we were on time but we waited patiently in line for people in front of us to check in/be seated.  Which means the hostess did not wait and sat people at our table.   I initially was going to let it go but her rudeness was leaving not a good feeling.  My friend argues with her because it was not fair we were being blamed for something that was her fault this time.  Also she told us to go for a walk since the wait was going to be 30-45 minutes?!

Okay, well, can't really argue with that. And I'm glad I didn't. That was a really good chicken sandwich. I had mine with grilled chicken and fresh garlic, in addition to the standard issue peppers and veggies. Dang, it was really good! The bread was soft, warm, and it soaked up the Italian seasoning with perfect absorbancy without going soggy. I cannot complain.  My wife had a chicken caesar wrap which was also excellent. The dressing was creamy without being cloying and it had a nice garlic zip to it.   This is the place to eat!"", ""I hate the dentist... well, I should say I hated the dentist.

He not only told me he showed me. He didn't harp on things I did wrong but things I can do in the future. The entire experience was exceptionally pleasant and his staff was great!

Can't say one outshined the other, I truly enjoyed every dish I tried. I liked the flavors and the creativity in all the dishes.   The bar/waiting room looked like the ultimate man cave. They have a limited choice in spirits, but what sets them apart is the rare and exotic choices.   I can see myself returning in the future. This place is ideal for a quick bite or boys night out.

Once I herd about them opening a place like this, I was so excited because I LOOOOVE Vietnamese sandwiches back in San Diego.  I couldn't wait to try it here in, my new home.   They just opened 4 days ago and I highly do recommend giving this place a try if you want something new or different... The customer service is awesome and the lady that works there is very welcoming! She puts a smile on my face .    They have sandwiches that are 12'  -- you can order just the sandwich or a combo that includes a fountain drink and a side of chips.

How many times I have called a store, an agency or somewhere else and spent 10-20 minutes trying to find a real human to answer questions.  Then we were referred to Rob Dischert.  We ran into a brick wall getting our mortgage because of some Fannie Mae rule and we thought we were in serious trouble.  We had taken money from our retirement accounts to close, assuming that getting a mortgage in the 60 day window to redeposit our funds would be easy.  Not so.  But someone in our condo complex referred us to Rob Dischert who, it appears, is very good at pulling rabbits out of a hat when necessary.  Rob got the mortgage we thought was unattainable.  Then when the first company with whom we had spoken suddenly called with a lower rate, Rob immediately went up the chain at Homebridge at matched that rate.    For some reason, we ran into a lot of problems this time with Fannie Mae rules and getting through the process was stressful, to say the least.  But Rob supported us throughout the sobering adventure.  He was our \""\""go to\""\"" guy for virtually any questions we had.  At the end with all the paperwork done and approval in hand, Rob came to our home with the title company representative and walked us through the paperwork step by step.  Fannie Mae has changed a lot of the forms we were used to, so Rob patiently educated my wife and me regarding all of the stack of documents we had to sign.  In short, Rob delivered stellar service at every step of the mortgage process.  To say we were pleased is an understatement.  The next time we need a mortgage, Rob will be at the top of my list.  He is a great guy who delivers extraordinary service."", ""After strings of a variety of different restaurants in the same building, this one I think is a keeper!  The bar area has lots of TV's for the sports freaks. The more important part, the bar is stocked with good selection of draft beer, tons of local products, great cocktail selection and knowledgeable bartenders. They can whip up something great and customize it with however your heart desires.  As for the food, they have a really good selection and reasonably priced. The cheese curds are great and the Bavarian pretzel is ginormous.  The entrees are good from meat, seafood and pasta selections. It's an American standard fare and they put some spins on some items such as their Americanized orange chicken who his actually pretty decent with their jasmine rice.   They also have a kids menu. My son loves their chicken tenders and fries. Don't expect pink slime on their chicken. It's the real deal and how they seasoned it is pretty good.   They have daily specials. Probably my fave will be the bottomless mojitos on Mondays."", ""These guys are GREAT.

Pizza is cut in aquares, like Imos and the bacon was laid on top . I mean strips of bacon, no cut up bacon. Pizza was ok, taste wise, which is the only positive thing I can say about this place.

Our son hates cheese on a pizza and they had one already on the menu for him: The Marinara (oregano, crushed san marzano tomatoes, garlic, olive oil).  It was simple... but delicious. If you like real wood-fired pizzas that char the crust (a little blackened... in a good way), this is the place to go to.  Our other favorite pizza joints that rival this place are Lombardi's (NYC) and Grimaldi's (Brooklyn).  We all had a slice and were shocked at the lovely simplicity of it. Razor thin slices of garlic dotted the fresh tomato sauce.  My husband and I shared the Salsiccia (fennel sausage, roasted fennel, tomato sauce, mozzarella).  Roasted fennel on a pizza?  Brilliant. I cried a little.  No wait... I REALLY cried when we shared this cocktail: The Brooklyn (Dad's Hat rye, Luxardo cherry, white vermouth).  It says it serves one, but they brought it out in a cute little bottle and gave us each a glass...each with a hand- crafted giant square ice cube (hipster-cool) and Luxardo cherries.  Perfection.  We also shared a Rotolo (pizza dough, mortadella, ricotta, pistacchio pesto).  Those are crazy amazing.  I kept saying my husband could eat the rest... then freaking out and going back for another bite. He's lucky I didn't stab him in the hand with a fork to fight over the last bite (to be fair, he was the smart one who ordered it).  I could've eaten several of those and forgotten the pizza (although that was wonderful too!).  We finished with a little dessert... perfect little Italian cookies (\""\""Cookie Jar\""\"" - pignoli, almond cookies, chocolate biscotti, pistacchio gnocchi) and I got an Affogato (fiordilatte soft serve with a shot of espresso).  The soft serve is Italian sweet cream... decadent and lovely... with rich espresso in a pretty little Italian mug.  I'm in Heaven here.

I've been pleased each time. The hot stone massage with the pedicure is heavenly. Every nail tech has been friendly and the results have been uniformly good. The staff is primarily Chinese. Sometimes the nail tech will translate what is going on out of the blue. It is a nice gesture.  It's very clean. They use sanitized tool packs for each manicure or pedicure.  They offer water and a dish of candies. The waiting area is small but the leather couches are comfy. They have 2 nice size mounted TVs with closed captioning on the one. One time I requested a particular program and they were more than happy to put it on. The price is right.  The owners are courteous. You don't need an appt but I try to call ahead since it gets busy in there.

We ordered IPAs and an imaginary friend which were both excellent and the perfect drinks to begin the meal.  We ordered the 3 cheeses, all paired with their own jam.  The cheddar cheese with the apple butter is to die for.  We also ordered the bacon fat cornbread for an appetizer and let me tell you, this thing was simply delicious.  We basically licked the skilled clean.  We also all shared a beet salad and the roasted cauliflower - excellent even after the gluttonous cornbread!

Upon the test drive the car was was hesitating as I was shifting gears and he said that they would look at the problem before I left the lot if I bought the car. I paid $3000 for it and needless to say....what a piece of *%#@! Everything that was checked off their \""\""maintenance report\""\"" saying was in good condition had to be replaced within the first week I had the car as I took it to a reputable mechanic.

I went in there asked for the manager and then I stood in the dealership for 30-minutes before he came up to me.

Here we go..  The Top Deck Restaurant is home to the $4.99 Steak and Eggs for Breakfast, $4.99 Steak and Fries for Dinner and the ever popular.......(drumroll now) $5.99 Prime Rib dinner! And I know some may be apprehensive to trying steak and prime rib dinners for such a low cost. But let me tell you, you would be shocked at the quality and the deliciousness that you get from here. And did I mention the cost!  They have other menu items here as well as to not just highlight what they seem to already have on their building (the steaks) the menu items range from.. Chicken Dinners, Salads, Burritos, Pastas, Sandwiches, Soups, Burgers ect. This place has your general \""\""Diner\""\"" style motif going on here.   The service here is decent, it could vary depending on who you get, some of the waiters and waitresses seem like they get annoyed very easy. But I say \""\""suck it up\""\"" with some of the best prices around you know you're going to get a lot of business. I usually leave my tips according to my service. I usually visit at least twice a day on my stays in Reno so I guess they get okay tips from me. The Prime Rib dinner honestly is the only thing I've ordered from here. Compared to big chain restaurants and my fav Prime Rib spot here in Nor Cal Mac's Ol House. This place holds its ground as a solid steakhouse.  When you get the Prime Rib dinner it comes with the soup of the day which usually varies between..  Split Pea Clam Chowder Chicken Noodle  You could have French Fries or Mashed Potatos for your side or even mixed veggies if you want to lay easy on the carbs.   In closing, \""\""All hands on Deck\""\"" all in the front, all in the back just like that! This is a place you \""\""Must\""\"" visit when you are out here in Reno. I always end up meeting cool people in here and overall just enjoying the food here. This place is the true star of the Club Cal Neva, and I don't see this place losing it's shine anytime soon.

Firstly - super excited about housemade biscuits.  Its really shocking to me that very few places bother to do this.  Gravy was tasty, but could have used a little more.  Now, in all fairness, I treat gravy like an entree as opposed to an accompaniment, so for \""\""normal\""\"" folk, you may find the gravy quantity acceptable.  I went with bacon, which was really good - thick slices, nice and crispy.  And my eggs were cooked perfectly to order.  I really liked the crispy potatoes, as well.  Two, small whole potatoes, well seasoned and seared on the outside.  The OJ was fresh and tasty - not too tart.   My friend had the nest egg.  She thought it was really tasty, but since I didn't try it, I don't have much to say about that.   I think the food is excellent.  I will agree with other reviews - not a fan of the community seating.  We didn't have an issue finding a seat and people did move along quickly, but since folks tend to want to catch up over a meal, you don't really have the privacy or the space to do that here.  I am hoping the excellent food results in more seating!!"", ""Had dinner at Bailey's Range last night (10/27/11).  My wife and I had the ABC burger and the lamb burger and shared halves...this was a flavor explosionary experience! Everything about both burgers was awesome! The meat was delish, the buns perfect, toppings perfect.  The beer selection is all St. Louis area beer except no AB-InBev products which isnt St. Louis area beer anymore is it? The pickle was like the best pickle I've ever had and the ketchup was great too.  They actually make the pickles and ketchup themselves.  Fries were quite good, kindof a British-style chip, you  know a little translucent.  For soda lovers, they have an amazing array of non corn-syrup selections, i.e., cane sugar.    Rest assured, I will be back for the wedge salad and the bison burger on another day."", ""Great clams! Great drinks and great service, thanks Matt T!

I had avoided the restaurant because of lukewarm experiences at restaurants that had previously occupied this space. But they have a new customer now due to the friendly service and good food.  They did a good job keeping the menu short and sweet which seems to allow them to focus on what they do best. I had crab bisque and a Thai salad with chicken. Both were fresh and delicious.

When we got there, our table was almost ready so the hostess asked us to wait at the bar. We got a drink while we were waiting and the bartender happily transferred our tab to our table. They had a specialty house drink which my boyfriend and I both tried, it wasn't my taste but he loved it. There was a band playing that night, and our table was close by. The band was wonderful, played excellent jazz! The food is served tapas style so it comes out as it's ready. We started with the fries, topped with feta cheese which were perfectly crispy and delicious. We got the bulgogi rice bowl which was flavorful but could have had a little more meat and vegetables to go with the rice. We were still hungry so we got an order of the mac & cheese and the bruschetta which were both phenomenal, I recommend getting each. After my house drink I had one of the beers, the fire ant, which was delicious. At the end of our meal the hostess came by to ask us if we minded moving to the sidebar table as they were behind on the reservations. It was a little offputting to be asked to move after spending $80 on a meal, but I understood and we happily moved. I read reviews that the servicehere was lacking and the bartenders were rude, but this was not our experience. The server was attentive, and the bartender was extremely friendly and helpful in ordering and was happy to transfer our tab for us.

I'm just glad we didn't make that mistake. El Tumi had great good and nice staff. The menu was so unique that it left me wondering why there are not many Peruvian restaurants in the bay area. Run of the mill cuisines - Italian, mexican and mediterranean - exude the image of mass-production and lack of creativity can make the meal quite forgettable. Peruvian dishes are something else - delightfully different. Perhaps it's the rareness of Peruvian restaurants that makes the cuisine so exclusive. I especially loved the yucca fries and the Peruvian style vegetarian fried rice. Besada - the hot peruvian barley beverage was very soothing on the cold winter night. Loved the passion fruit drink too. El Tumi is definitely worth visiting second night in a row when in Tahoe. I will make sure to look out for Peruvian restaurants whenever I go traveling/visiting a new place."", ""Expensive but great service & food. The ribeye melted in my mouth.

We were feeling like comfort food and had the chicken tenders-  The portions were very generous and the food was just solid.  Not fussy or stuffy or trying hard... just good, wholesome and good to eat. The service was fine- however there is only one waitress for the tables and the bar, so i can imagine that if it is full that would cause some delays.  Overall it was just a lovely meal and the prices were unbelievably reasonable (most places have crabcakes 1/2 that size for twice that price)...

They said mine was the next one out the door and should be there in a few minutes, because I live about 1 mile away from the store. At 1:00am, still no pizza. I call again and they said the driver left with my order and another order 30 minutes ago, and instead of driving to my house first, which was 1 MILE AWAY, he went to the other house first which was further away, and gave them their pizza AND MY PIZZA. They offered to make a new one and send it out, but I didn't want to wait up until 3 in the morning, so I said no thanks. They offered a free pizza on my next order, but that doesn't do anything to help me right now because it too late to order from anywhere else. This is why Uber Eats and other forms of food delivery will end up crushing stores like this. So to whoever runs this store, seriously, congratulations. You've just won the award for worst store in the franchise."", ""Unbelievably the worst experience shopping I've had in a long time. Pre shopped online at home to find 3 of a particular tool chest they had in stock. Looked good. Drove down to the location minutes after confirming the stock. When I arrived I talked to no less than 3 associates who all were clueless as to where the item was. After being abandoned multiple times while they went to \""\""go look for me\""\"" and then found these same associates helping other customers I decided to go up to the customer service desk to seek assistance. When I arrived there they also had no idea why their computers showed 3 items in stock but couldn't find them still. Ok so I begrudgingly agreed to have a new item shipped to the store (they couldn't figure out how to ship it to the store closest to me so I again, beaten down, acquiesced to driving down to this much further store to get the item I wanted.) I was told we'll have the item here in 1-2 days. Great. Fast forward to 5 days later. The store has no idea where the new item is. I wish I was making this up, but it gets better! They have no idea where it is! And tell me the order had actually been canceled on their end. But... it's in stock at another store even further away! I leave upset but determined to get my item. Fast forward. I'm now at the other store with the receipt for my initial purchase which was refunded because they could not find the item. Which shows a discounted price for my troubles. The other store now says they can't match the price of the original store because that was a discount they gave me and they are different stores. So finally I gave up and went else where.

The waitress would not let us in and asked me if I was able to pay the restaurant minimum. Her attitude changed immediately after my Chinese husband showed up.) I let the first incident slide but this one sent me through the roof. I just helped my friend's family plan a 40th birthday party for her and the night manager was one of the rudest people I've ever met. Let me preface that my husband and his family know him from many years of working in Chinatown and we've always helped support his business. To make a long story short: I booked a birthday party for 7:00. The family came early to set up, as he said it was allowed. At 6:30 he came in yelling that we have to leave at 9:00 because he has someone coming in and we can't stay there all night. I reminded him that we have a 7:00 reservation and that we spoke several times to confirm and he said \""\""So what I don't care, it doesn't matter be out by 9.\""\"" He was yelling at me across the restaurant. He was so unprofessional and hurtful, especially since we've always supported this business. At 8:55 he came in and said we could stay longer, but I couldn't even look at him and everyone was ready to leave anyway. His verbal abuse practically ruined my night.

Never have i wanted to send back everything i ordered at a restaurant before this night.  i will never be back.  my husband says he will order the wings, but takeout only. no more dining in at this place."", ""I love takoyaki (octopus balls) and okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake) and almost always jump at the chance to order these when I can.  Sadly, Maru Global doesn't know how to make either.    I came here for dinner a while back and when I left, the remains of a half-eaten okonomiyaki lay on the table.  I am a beastly pig, and this for me, is kind of unheard of.  They aren't terribly well staffed here (at least when I came with a group of about 7), so if you order all at once in a large group, it takes quite a while for people to get to eat.    But on the food side, I ordered an okonomiyaki, and what I got was a pancake with a grainy, doughy texture, that was incredibly oversalted.  The consistency of the takoyaki was similarly off although I can't put my finger on what exactly was wrong.  Anyway, suffice it to say that I've had plenty of great octopus balls and Japanese pancakes elsewhere (like in New York, you can find this in the East Village in the form of Yakitori Taisho or, my fav, Otafuku, or in Philly there's Yakitori Boy).  This place just doesn't cut it, and I'm certain I won't be coming back."", ""All I needed was a written estimate.  A rather simple task one would think.  I needed my factory navigation unit in my Denali replaced, and needed to know costs and in writing.  Now this is a normal standard procedure for an auto repair shop.  Let's just assume its bad (it is), so tell me how much it is to remove bad part, and put the new one in.  Jay Fatimo or something like that, said he was very busy, as were the other service writers, so he handed me his card, and said to just email him with what I needed.  Sounded like a good plan, I wasn't in a big rush.  So I did just that, sent a picture of my vin, and the appropriate RPO codes to know what part I needed, and emailed it all to him.  I never got a response.  I tried again about a week or so later, still nothing.  Made sure it is his email at the dealership, etc.    I guess I have a hard time with taking my car in or trusting a place to do such repairs (3000 dollar job according to Winkel GMC) if they can't even respond to an email.  He knew I would email that day, and I did.    I guess the GMC dealer right next door gets my money instead."", ""For a long time as a Chinese foodie my family loved going to Han Dynasty.  But we went there for my birthday last week and the food was horrible. The string beans were fried in stale tasting oil and the boss won't admit it had a bad taste to it.

Our last dish, orange beef was also covered in thick breading, beef was not tender, hard to chew and it had crazy amount of glaze glob on it.

I had chicken parm and it was awful.....I actually got a piece of grizzle I had to remove from my mouth. And it was soggy. The red gravy was among the worst I have had EVER.  And the pasta was overcooked.  I could not eat it.  A friend who also attended had the same opinion and did not eat the entr\u00e9e.  I have heard negative comments about Andreas for years now.

Normally when I come here I order the South Cider or the Shelby Blue Ribbon, but on my last trip I decided to taste one of their seasonal items.

The only reason I'm not overcome with guilt of misleading people with the extra star is because once in a while, once you suffer through the ordering experience, the food is somewhat tasty. Sometimes.   I am surprised to see more reviewers didn't comment specifically on the chain smoking, smug, openly mocking rude sandwich maker that seems to always be the only employee. A few did, but not all.   This man COMPLETELY ruins the subway experience. He laughs at you the whole time you order, moves so slow, doesn't respond when spoken to, and gives the most disturbing looks. I do not understand how he keeps his job, unless he's also the owner, and in that case I don't understand how he runs the business.

I chose the spicy tuna tartar which was a small dollop of unrecognizable fish cut with jicama, which you don't realize until too late and realize the small portion of fish is really an even smaller portion of fish.

Our waitress was incredibly nice and was very quick to check on us and take our order.  We shared a 12\""\"" thin crust with bacon and ricotta and it may have been one of the best pizzas we both have had.   Only weird thing was the fact that their was absolutely no lighting in the bathroom.

The menu was created by Marquis and Rich Landau, known for the upscale vegan restaurant, Vedge, and his previous endeavor, Horizon's restaurant. HipCityVeg is a fast food restaurant that serves burgers, wraps, salads, fries, and healthy drinks of many popular non-vegan dishes. I had to try two of these creations!  Let's be honest... These sandwiches didn't last very long! The sandwiches had a lot of flavor and were fantastic! My favorite of the two was the Crispy HipCity Ranch, by a long shot! I liked the Buffalo Bella, but I thought that there would be more of a buffalo flavor. The Crispy HipCity Ranch tasted very much like it's non-vegan counterpart but more fresh and better prepared. I was most impressed by this sandwich! These sandwiches aren't cheap, but are worth the cash if you can spare it!  The restaurant is small. Small enough that I decided to take-out instead of waiting for someone at one of the 5 or so small tables to leave. I decided to just take my order home to eat, but the restaurant is close to Rittenhouse Square, a great park for picnicking or eating from a bench. The atmosphere at HipCityVeg is clean and refreshing. There is water available while you're there that is flavored with fresh fruits. I enjoyed some while I waited for my order to be prepared. There was a FourSquare deal available when I ordered here, and they accept LevelUp, an iPhone or Android app based payment service that has loyalty discounts."", ""This used to be the old Union Station.

The soap left my 8 year old, 2 year old even my 1 month old's skin feeling silky smooth, smelling fresh and most importantly chemical free! Success!   I will never EVER buy soap anywhere else! I highly recommend this shop and remember it's great to support locally owned businesses!"", ""We love Mamma Maria's!  The aroma of garlic is enjoyable & makes you anticipate the delights in store when you enter the restaurant.   We started out with a very friendly server who took our drink orders and appetizer order & told us about the soup of the day. Her name was Tracey. She promptly delivered our drinks and let us know that Kristen would be taking over serving.    A very courteous gesture in my opinion.   Kristen was bubbly, friendly & very attentive.    Now for the food, the calamari fritta was delicious and lightly battered. This was tender and had a delicious flavor, served with a chunky flavorful marinara and juicy lemon wedges. The white pizza was delicious and mouthwatering. The crust crispy and the abundant flavor of the roasted garlic was a delight! Always delicious and always consistent.  Looks like they have a tempting selection of desserts, but I showed some discipline and didn't indulge."", ""I came here on a hot night after hearing the hype about the new Thai style rolled ice cream place on South Street. And now I see what all the hype was about! The experience of watching the chefs at work was so entertaining, and the creations they came up with were deligant (delicious; elegant). I got the Pink Lady, and my sidepiece got the Bumblebee. It was lit AF.

Right across the street from every shopping center you could want.  Rooms were clean and updated, they are very accommodating about late check out, very hospitable.  sure you can spend 250 to stay on the strip and have a smoke filled/Packed  hotel, but if you don't mind being a few miles out, this place is perfect,  cheap cab ride to the strip. Only take sparks cab, we took a few, not only are they 33% cheaper (on average) but they are far more personable and faster upon arrival."", ""We walked here from Napoleon and St. Charles after dinner one night. The crowd was light and the staff was very friendly. We had a scoop of Creole Cream Cheese and a scoop of Red Velvet...it was amazing. The Thai Basil Coconut was also really delicious and really refreshing. This place is great...I look forward to visiting on our next trip."", ""Awesome local brunch if you can wait the 30 - 90 minute wait. I like to walk around the neighborhood while I wait, great garage sales nearby usually.   French toast is yummy and so are the potato pancakes."", ""Stopped in for lunch, was not disappointed. Server was very polite and on top of everything. Very knowledgeable of the local beers they currently had, my boyfriend really enjoyed one she recommended. I had the sirloin, was cooked just right and, sides were great. Would definitely visit this location again."", ""We love this place. The pizza is awesome and the service is fantastic. This is a small local business and they went above and beyond for us to right what we thought was a minor issue (i.e a late pizza). We were already loyal customers, but after tonight we are even more. But service only matters if the food is good. I've spent a lot of time in France and some in Italy and had a lot of good pizza and I love Eclipse pizza. It's fantastic!!!!"", ""Was traveling though Tampa for work and decided to hit this well reviewed restaurant with some coworkers.  Ordered the Curry Chicken and it was excellent but far too much food (I don't consider that to be a bad thing).  Service was exceptionally friendly and the person serving us told us that he owns the restaurant with his wife who is the chef.  Great spot!"", ""I've been here 3 times so far and each time I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. I've tried the peanut butter infused cold brew and iced americano I liked them both.  My mom had the cortado which she raved about. But the treats they home make here are my favorite part. Like the chocolate chia pudding topped with toasted coconut and raspberries is DELICIOUS :) Also the PB ball with chia seeds, coconut, oats, and chocolate chips goes perfectly with my coffee. This coffee shop is unique and has its own charm I love it!"", ""Chill has incredible creative food combinations that are absolutely delicious! My family and I love this restaurant. The staff and owner are delightful as well."", ""Went here with a couple co-workers for lunch and they were really good. The place is a bit small inside, so you feel a little cramped inside. However, the service is quick. They were busy when we arrived around 12:30 (so right at lunch) and they still kept everything moving in a very quick pace. Plus the amount of food you get is pretty decent, and they are pretty inexpensive. Will be back for sure."", ""Finally a Pho and Banh Mi (my FAVAORITE SANDWICH) all in one spot!  After reading alot of positive reviews from Yelp users for this place I finally made it down to Rockville Road to try for my self. I went during lunch and ordered the Grilled Beef spring rolls and the Grilled Pork Banh Mi.  The spring rolls were made fresh and had grilled beef, vermicilli and mint wrapped inside served with a side chili/fish sauce. These were very fresh tasting and that mint added just the right amount of herby-ness.  The Banh Mi was SO GOOD! Now I am a Banh Mi snob...yeah I said it. I believe that as with any sandwich the bread accounts for 50% of how good or bad a sandwich is. You can have the best toppings in the world but if you dont have the right crusty/chewy/soft bread to serve it in, whats the point?!?!?  Pho 36's Grilled Prok Banh Mi met all my criteria. It was a decent size (12\""\""), pork was grilled just enough and not dry. The mayo on the sandwich tasted homemade. The toppongs (shredded carrots/shredded daikon radish/cilantro) were super fresh and added a great crunch. Add a lil Siracha and were off! Alot of Banh Mi sandwiches tend to not be filing enough (hence me ordering the spring rolls on this trip as well) but Pho 36's sandwich was just the right size for me and was filling.  The resturant itself is small (maybe 25-30 seats) but it was very clean and the gentlman who took my order was very knowledgable about the menu and had answers to all my questions.  Pho #^ will now be added to my weekly rotation now as I have not been able to stop thinking of my sandwich. Cant wait for the cooler months to arrive so I can start making my way through all the Pho selections on the menu."", ""I tried the cinnamon bun br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It. Was. Awesome. I would recommend that you heat it up if you're getting it. Takes this treat to a whoooooole notha level my friends! I'm a fan of the variety district donuts offers on a daily basis."", ""A truly magnificent venue!! Attended the Beth Hart concert last night! She was amazing and so is the space with it's old world charm. They don't build beautiful buildings like this anymore! Next door is a venue space that can be rented out for many different occasions.

Pedicure was ok but gel nails horrible. Looked like fat marshmallow nails and so bumpy. Went to another salon few days later. Run down older salon. Needs lots of improvements especially learn how to do nails. Paid extra for opi nail polish instead of old nail polish they had as a selection. Waste of money and time."", ""Good bagels, but they can NEVER get an order right.  We live in NJ so when you ask for Taylor Ham and cheese you think they would be able to handle this.    Instead I get a ham and cheese sandwich, or an egg, ham and cheese sandwich.  I am DONE with this place.  City Market or Lumberville General Store will be my two choices from here on out."", ""Not impressed. My husband and I decided to try take out this evening from this place. When we got home we opened our daughters spaghetti and meatballs and there was hardly any pasta/sauce and NO meatballs. Frustrating. Hubby had to drive back to the restaurant to get her meal corrected. I'll also add that I think $9 for a kids meals is a bit absurd for PASTA. My fettuccini Alfredo was bland. The portion was small but I never finish all the pasta most places give me so that wasn't a big deal. My husbands tortellini tasted like it was frozen, same with the calamari. Definitely doesn't taste like they use fresh ingredients. I will say they marinara is good but not enough for us to go back. A disappointing experience."", ""I absolutely enjoyed my Ultimate pedicure! Service staff are nice and professional. There are a wide range of nail polish brands such as Chanel and Zoya! The best thing is this place doesn't have that annoying nail polish smell. I will definitely come back."", ""Yelp doesn't allow to leave 0 star review, so that is why you see one star.

The lady that did virtual survey was very meticulous and professional and we \""\""screened\""\"" through the whole apartment in 15 minutes. No one contacted me after that, so I sent a second email almost a month after, on 06/05 asking if everything is ok, and if I can get the quote. I don't need to mention that other 4 companies sent their quotes in less than 48 hours. Since no one replied til today, I called the direct phone and I left the message on the answering machine. No one called me back. I hope everything is ok, and that no one is hurt, because I don't see any other reasonable explanation why they are avoiding me.

The manager James was amazing and very helpful. The chef, Richard, suggested the grits ( which I usually don't like) so he brought us out two bowls to try ( for free). A-mazing.    We ordered Breakfast Ya Ya and the crayfish omelet with bloody marys. The food was perfect and drinks strong. They put pickled greenbeans instead of celery which was really unique.   The service was attentive without being suffocating and I am definitely coming back before we leave."", ""This review incident dates back to 2009 but I still truly feel \""\""hot under the collar\""\"" about my used car experience with Sherwood Kia.  I bought a 2002 Sunfire, cash, off the lot. The salesman was pushy, rude, and very ignorant. Upon the test drive the car was was hesitating as I was shifting gears and he said that they would look at the problem before I left the lot if I bought the car. I paid $3000 for it and needless to say....what a piece of *%#@! Everything that was checked off their \""\""maintenance report\""\"" saying was in good condition had to be replaced within the first week I had the car as I took it to a reputable mechanic.  SO....7 days, I asked for my money back!!! I got the run around so bad that I eventually wrote a letter to the owner (AFTER NO ONE WAS RETURNING MY CALLS) and the Used Car dept. manager (whoever) called me after another 2 weeks and asked me to come in. I went in there asked for the manager and then I stood in the dealership for 30-minutes before he came up to me. Well....we got into a yelling match in the parking lot after I was in tears and yelling inside and threatened to call the BBB, tell everyone of FB, and whoever else would listen that...get this...(his exact words)...\""\""We DO NOT guarantee quality used vehicles\""\""!!!! I'm not kidding! I never got my money back and I REFUSE to ever do business there again!!!!"", ""Fair warning, this is gonna be a long one, involving multiple locations and Southwest's \""\""Customer Service\""\"".    I was heading out this past Thursday to make my cousin's HS graduation in east TX.  My first warning this would be the trip from hell was a text warning me of a delay in Tucson (TUS).  I live an hour & a half east of TUS, but decided to leave the house as originally planned to ensure I could speak to a gate agent.    My layover was to be 45 minutes in Denver, yet the delay was already 55 minutes due to weather according to the SW gate agent in TUS.  I was quickly informed I wouldn't make my Denver (DEN) departure.  What ensued was a crazy spider web of options having me fly to LAX, staying overnight in DEN, flying to Houston, then Dallas Love Field (DAL), my final destination...arriving at 5:45pm, with a 7pm graduation to make two hours away.  No Go!  Finally the gate agent said, \""\""Can you drive to Phoenix?...there's a flight leaving at 7:40pm.\""\""  Realizing I had a nearly two hour drive, she quickly changed my flight & I hauled butt off-site to pick up my car & drive to PHX.   During the drive I realized the gate agent hadn't rescheduled my return flight & my car would be parked in PHX.  I quickly parked at the closest lot so I could speak to a gate agent, the parking later costing me $75 for a three day stay.  I stood for 45 minutes while the poor gate agent, Nancy, tried every way she could to reschedule my return flight so I could reunite with my car.  The system repeatedly gave her error messages & she couldn't even check in a stroller for two dazed parents.  All her calls to her supervisor yielded no physical response.  Nancy did her best, calling everyone she could & finally informed me \""\""for future reference, ensure the original agent changes your return flight too.\""\""  A tad too late in this instance & I just had to board the plane, resorting to a Facebook post that yielded a possible ride from TUS to get my car in PHX, something I didn't want to use.  Nancy entered some notes & told me to call the 1-800-I-FLY-SWA customer service number to reschedule once in Texas.   Sadly, this was the tip of the iceberg.    The flight, pilots & flight attendants were wonderful.  I arrived 55 minutes later than my original flight, thankful the rental car company was still available.  What was terrible was the website & lack of customer service at FLY SWA.   Over two days I called eight times, spending a total of 4 hours, 18 minutes & 49 seconds desperately trying to get a human on the line.  As a tip - SW get some decent Muzak!  I stayed up til 4am freaking out because no one would respond, despite two messages saying I would get a call back in 15 minutes and 7 minutes, respectively.  I made two Facebook posts, even messaging them, with FB communications rep Lindsey no help.  During one hour+ session on hold I did a Google search & discovered that SW's website had gone into \""\""meltdown\""\"" & their phone lines were overwhelmed due to their recent low fare sale.  Sure enough, I checked the website, & was booted off repeatedly.  I was in full-on panic now because it showed I had no upcoming flights, listing my departure was on my original TUS flight, with my return the rescheduled flight out of PHX - stupid considering this would've meant that I was in the air at the same time on two separate flights!  It was a very sleepless night imagining I was going to have to book another very expensive, short-notice, flight just to get back to my car.   Finally my cousin said \""\""to hell with SW, let's go to Walmart & buy some wine!\""\""  Once again, I was on the phone, on hold buying a kiddie pool & booze when an angel named Rhonda finally answered.  24 minutes later I finally had a direct return flight to PHX, with a three hour drive home when I returned.  I have always loved the flight crews & agents at SW.  I love that they give snacks on the plane & their in-flight cocktails are reasonably priced.  But this was a very stressful \""\""adventure\""\"" I don't ever want to repeat.  After all was said & done, Rhonda informed me I somehow have a miraculous credit of $133 I must use in the next two months.  I am searching for a brave soul to purchase the ticket for since I really don't want to fly SW ever again.  Sadly, SW is typically more expensive than other carriers, particularly since I rarely need to check a bag, & if I do, it's always free since I'm in the military. In addition, there's no assigned seating for the extra cost.  (As a comedian once said \""\""Ever fly Southwest?...One thru Forty...GO!!!\""\"")  I might also add that most other carriers will let military pre-board, while Southwest does not.    I sincerely hope my experience this past weekend was a rare one & dedicated flyers fare better than I."", ""Excellent food, great beer selection, superb & very helpful staff. Highly recommended!"", ""Troy and his staff always make it a really good time at the Macaroni Grill I've been here several times for birthdays and special events they've always taken care of us.

A few locals or UCSB alums mixed with up-and-coming comedy talent featured on HBO specials and Comedy Central. The night I went there were four comics and an MC, and all were very entertaining. Be aware that the show is definitely not PG in any respect, so it's not a great event for kids or to go with your conservative elderly family members.

She scheduled us hair appointments with Ally W.  I was very nervous because I hadn't colored my hair in 7 years(it was just a very boring brown color) ;) I have hard water and didn't want my water to change the colors. I explained to her kind of what I wanted (blonde highlights) then told her about my hard water. She said she had a plan for me and would love to do caramel since my water is so hard. I let her do what she thought was best (usually I wouldn't), but she seemed to know what she was talking about and was VERY VERY confident in her job. I trusted her and walked out of the salon feeling fabulous. She did such an amazing job and I have never gotten so many compliments on my hair.  I love the confidence that she had and she was so personable. If I lived closer I would go back in a heartbeat. The next time I come and visit I will definitely be making another appointment with her. Thank you again Ally.  Carrie"", ""Bad service, bad food - just don't.   Besides service being slow (and with a 3 year old that is never a good thing) the food was less than stellar.  I got an egg white omelet that was swimming in oil - greasy beyond being edible.  It took the waiter quite awhile to notice I wasn't eating and when he came over and asked I explained that it was inedible. At that point I didn't even want anything else so he left and left the food on the table.  15 min later he comes back and takes the plate because the chef wanted to see it.  It wasn't until after this that he offered to deduct it from the check.  Meanwhile my daughter spills a full class of apple juice.  I'm using bar napkins to mop it up and had to make several trips to the bar to get more.  Several staff members saw me cleaning the spill off the floor and not one offered to help or get a mop.  On top of that all my daughters chicken was dry and stringy.  She was starving and ate it bathed in ketchup but it was not good.  Thanks but no thanks"", ""I've been here a handful of times and it's always because I don't have time to go to VN Nails near Costco where I prefer to go (they get 5 stars from me).  Kiwi Nail has always done a cheap job trying to take shortcuts wherever possible.  But today I've had it and will never go back!  After getting the typical shabby job on a fill with French tips,  I accidentally smudged two nails really badly.  They needed to be repainted and I asked her to do so... I even offered to pay extra.  The nail tech came over to look and she pressed the clumps back down and painted right back over the mess (didn't even keep the paint in the lines) then slathered so much varnish over the train wreck that it was literally dripping down my finger. After my nails were dry enough to leave,  another tech rang me up and the receipt had no place for a tip.  When I asked,  he told me I had to pay tips in cash... Well it's lucky for me I didn't have any cash.  He said I will have to tip her next time.  NEXT TIME??!!  yeah right!  There will be no next time!

Goleta needed a store like Haggen, it's nice to be able to get everything I need at one store."", ""The Real Deal  We ate some of the finest pastries I've ever had in my life at this bakery. Word.  We were fortunate enough to be with the other Gruntled Brunchers, who are friends of the proprietors of the bakery, so we were treated to a sampling of many of their pastries.   Just some of what we tried: opera cake - a moist, multilayered cake which reminded me of tira misu; apple strudels; fruit tarts;  eclairs; chocolate covered strawberries. All were delicious, but, then, the cheese puff pastry came out.   The cheese puff pastry is on a level all its own. Impossibly, insanely flaky, just sweet enough, almost salty. How can this be? I could have eaten five of these. Make certain you don't miss this.  We were fortunate to be there on Good Friday, so we could get a hot cross bun. I thought a hot cross bun was some hard crusted bread with a cross cut in the top for rising. I was so, so wrong. This traditional treat is a brioche-type bread with a tiny sprinkling of sweet fruit pieces throughout, and an icing \""\""X\""\"" drawn on the top. Again, light, airy, with sweetness that is a hint, not a sledgehammer. There's a bunch of history behind the hot cross bun, and Patricia, the executive chef, took the time to tell us. Check it out on Wikipedia if you're curious.  And, I have to say something about the raspberry \""\""bear claw\""\"". If you've ever had what others call a bear claw, forget those. Brent said it's an insult to this crazy-good, flaky, just-right pastry to name it the same thing you can get out of a vending machine.   We took a field trip, as Harry said, through the kitchen, where Ziggy, the owner, pastry chef, and all-around nice guy, was making a Harry Potter wizard hat cake. He rolled out fondant icing and expertly threw the thick layer over the cake. He gave us a taste of the fondant. In my experience, fondant is pretty but not so tasty. Not so for this chocolate fondant. Mmmmmmm! I would happily have eaten a huge slab of this stuff.   We left with a tea cake in tow. Ziggy told us it was something like a Kugelhof, and not as heavy as a pound cake. It was so beautiful, I simply had to try one, though at this point I really didn't need more pastries. I had a piece as soon as I could get a knife. Again, unbelievable...I can't say more. Somehow it was simultaneously buttery but light, and just moist enough without approaching stickiness. I had more of this than I care to admit right after I'd eaten my weight in sweets.  At this point, I'm glad I do not live down the street from Maple Street Patisserie. I could see myself having a problem if I lived too close to a bakery this tempting.  Just to sum it all up: the sweet pastries are delectable, but the breads, brioches, bear claws!, and tea cakes are in a class all their own.  And, I haven't even tried the savory croissants yet."", ""So much care is given to healthy, delicious food (ex. Japanese squash rather than white potatoes in curry). Thay have nice touches like a welcome snack and straw wrappers twisted in a rose. The sauces are amazing, menu has so many options, they accomodate special dietary needs easily since everything is made from scratch; even the desserts have that extra touch using both white and black sticky rice. This is our go-to for Thai from now on!"", ""Unbelievable! Some sports bar, $5 cover charge, got wanded for guns and they didn't have any sports on. They had a video looping of Mexican music.

It was all because of the nail tech, i didn't get her name but she was young, Vietnamese with a med length bob haircut. I went in for a gel color polish change. Her work is not as neat as what im use to there. She for some reason placed two scolding hot towels over each of my hands while removing the old color. I told her that the towels were too hot and she than removed them and swung them in the air to cool off than reapplied. She than asked 'is this better princess \""\"".  Than she turned around and ask if that woke me up. I've had a gel polish color change several times before, no one has ever placed hot towels on my hands EVER,  i don't know why she did. After the gel color polish was applied and dry she repeatedly reapplied a top thick coat over and over. I kept having to place my hands under the uv light again, thats never happened before either.

Between the wood walls, wood crafted tables and Edison bulbs, this is a great addition to the northern Pinellas county area!  It is small and quaint with local beers on tap and a nice selection of wine (our server told us they are looking to expand into vacant store next door and add a full liquor bar within the next year).  Right off the bat, we had a warm welcome.    The menu is smaller, which means they pretty much perfect the dishes they do make.  We had some beer and wine and went to town on the appetizers:  sack of potatoes (with bacon butter! That literally comes in a small sack....of potatoes); pork skins (who doesn't love fried pork fat?!) deviled eggs topped with fried chicken and caviar (I am not personally a caviar fan, so I just took it off) and their hot chicken boneless wings (with beet kimchi and hot buttermilk sauce, aka my FAVORITE)  I personally loved the joint, and will definitely be coming back to try that lamb burger that kept eyeballing me."", ""Great job fixing my car.

The Salon itself was clean and organized which is an important thing most salons don't take seriously. Anna was amazing - she not only understood ( language and meaning) what I wanted but went above and beyond to make it better and seemed genuinely happy too. She was fast, experienced and outgoing.

The hotel is beautiful, the location is perfect, and the Carousel bar is one of the best bars in New Orleans.

We will definitely be staying here again."", ""Never had Malaysian food before eating here, but it's extremely good.

I was sore for days after and it honestly was the best quick workout I've ever done. I'll definitely be going back!"", ""Having stayed here several times, it is my favorite hotel. The staff is excellent. Really exceptional. Everyone from housekeeping to front desk staff to valets.  Rooms are clean, heating and AC are quiet, beds are very comfortable and they make it feel special.  Special K is awesome. I cannot say enough about how wonderful and helpful he has been over all of our visits. One of the best reasons to visit this hotel. Did I mention the exceptional staff?  Turn-down service is Sucre chocolates on your pillow. Sweets for the sweet dreams.  The bathroom wasn't as slippery this time.   This was the first time we used the valet service and it worked great. No more than a 10 minute wait for the car. You can text them from your phone and they text back with how long it will take.  They also hosted a Gold Status reception. We made a brief appearance on our way to a Mardi Gras ball.  Our only glitch was a mini-bar charge on our bill. We didn't consume any of their food or drink and they happily removed it from the bill.  We will be back. Note to hotel: please put Louis back in the elevator."", ""The service here is pretty fast, seemingly even on at prime dinner time of 8pm. The portions for the main course that I got seemed small - but if you get an appetizer either to share or on your own, an average person should be in good shape.   For the table we got an order of the Truffle Rosemary Parmesan French Fries, which were very flavorful. It had a nice earthy truffle taste, balanced with the saltiness of the Parmesan, and rounded out with the rosemary.   Main course was the Bacon Wrapped shrimp with Stone ground Grits. This was exceptional - and was probably the best 'shrimp n' grits' i've had in NOLA. Shrimp was perfectly cooked, with a crisp piece of bacon wrapped around it. It stayed crispy even on top of the moist, decadent, and flavorful cheese grits."", ""Absolutely INCREDIBLE. Every time we go we leave 100% satisfied. Food is fresh, delicious, and the service is impeccable. We usually sit at the bar, great bartenders as well.   We go at least once a month.

Great food, great service, great people, all at a great price! I will be back!"", ""Today was our first visit, it's a cool little place in a nice neighborhood. Thankfully they have their own parking lot but there's plenty of street parking too, which is good because it was packed. The inside was nice and cozy and it had plenty of seating, not that it mattered because it was so crowded but I can't fault them for that.  The customer service was really good, although the guy who took our order didn't seem to believe that I knew what a double shot macchiato would be because he kept asking me if I had ever had one before. I badly needed pure caffeine so it was just what I wanted, I'm just not sure what the questioning about my choice was all about.  That being said, when I got it it was great, obviously good quality espresso. My husband got their popular hot chocolate which he wasn't a fan of but I really liked since it tasted like actual chocolate instead of like a powder. He also got an espresso bar which was some kind of sugary chocolate treat, and he loved that. Their to go cups are also really cute. It's out of the way but we'll definitely be back."", ""long long long wait but the food was good.  I had the shrimp and grits"", ""The food here is delicious, fast, and consistent every single time. We generally get the cucumbers, dan dan, wontons, dry pot fish, three cup chicken, and garlic style beef. All are delicious and of different spice levels so that we get a variety of heat and flavor. I'm always bringing friends here who haven't been before. They always keep coming back and bringing new people as well. This place is solid and as long as it's open, I'll keep coming back."", ""Great place for breakfast! I had the waffle, which was fluffy and perfect, and home fries which were nice and smashed and crunchy. Friendly waitstaff. Will definitely be back!"", ""I've wanted to check out Delicia for so long! When a friend and I decided to head out for dinner during Devour Indy, I was so glad to see them on the list! The guacamole they served as an appetizer was great, I'm a guac lover, and the pistachios added a really nice flavor to it. We both chose the salmon, and fell in love with this dish. The salmon was perfectly cooked, juicy and flaky. The polenta was amazing. I left wishing I had ordered another to have the next day! It was nice having the signature drinks included with dinner. He chose the sangria and I chose the margarita. Both were very good. I'll definitely be back to Delicia for dinner again. This place was a great choice!""]",28

It was really great and the server Tina I think her name was, did a great job handling about 25 people all on her own. My beer was never empty and the food was prompt, hot and delicious.

The hall is pretty small and rustic looking. There are no bathrooms at all - you'll have to go across the street to the bar. Also, you can bring your drinks in.  The jazz show was great - lasted about 45 min. No speakers, no microphones. Just the music and the acoustics. It was nice.  Come early or you'll end up standing up. Theres about 8 rows of seats on each side that fit about 6 people each. The rows are pure wood- not really very comfy but what can you do."", ""Where do I even begin? My coworkers and I came across this place when we ventured out of our hotel one evening. It ended up being the only place we regularly went. The staff at this place are incredible. They always seem to have enough bartenders behind the bar and they know when it's going to be busy. Service is prompt. You can tell that the management has placed an emphasis on customer service. employees are very friendly, and outgoing. speaking of the management, I had the pleasure to meet the husband and wife that own this place. They are extremely pleasant and very fun to talk to. as for the smoke, yes as mentioned in previous reviews there is smoke inside the bar. You will however find that it's not the typical smoke you find in a rundown 80's dive bar with some cover band in the background. This place has adequate ventilation, and the smoke is not overpowering.  The patrons that frequent this establishment all seem to be very cordial , and are there to just have a good time.

The shop has a quick turnaround but does tons of business so I'd recommend you call them before dropping off your vehicle if you can.

It was savory, fresh and fragrant with herbs. My dinner partners enjoyed their dishes, too-  Shrimp with Andouille Sausage, Grilled Wild Striped Bass and a Veal dish.

Come along with me, as I journey back in time -- all the way back to Wednesday...  I step foot in this 7 Eleven, and the first thing I think is: this is one of the nicest looking 7 Elevens I've ever seen. It is very clean, bright, and spacious. Very nice looking selection of prepared meals. There were many that actually looked like they'd be quite good. But I wasn't hungry this day. No. All I needed were a few items.   First, some good old TP. And let me be perfectly clear (as clear as Barack Obama): I DON'T buy the cheapest toilet paper because I'm cheap. I buy it because I like the way the cheap stuff feels. The more like sandpaper, the better. I like to feel like its working. I don't need to or even want to feel like an angel is up there. Or some perverted freak named Scott.   In any case, I got myself 4 rolls. And then I just needed one more thing - some plastic cups for a little party I'm having this weekend.   I go ahead and drop my stash on the counter, begin to extract several singles from my wallet, when the cashier looks at me and says, \""\""24.99.\""\""  I respond, \""\""That's not right.\""\""  He points at a price tag on the plastic cups which reads 19.99. I begin laughing. I tell him the price is clearly wrong. He tells me he's got to talk to his manager. Meanwhile, I tell the folks behind me waiting in line that I'm just going to go run and get different plastic cups to hurry the process along. Before he got back from doing his price check, I already had another cashier ringing up my two sleeves of cups for 1.99 each. That's more like it.  At around that same moment, the first cashier comes back from his consultation with his manager. He tells me that the price was, in fact, incorrect. And that the price is actually 14.99.  THAT'S the unscrupulous part.  CLEARLY, THAT price is also far too high. His manager did no actual price check at all. He simply told the cashier to pretend that the real price was actually 5 dollars less, thinking that I'd be stupid enough to accept this. Why, because I'm white, and you're a racially superior Indian? You think white people are stupid don't you?

This is not a sit down place. You have two options: drive thru window or walk up window. So I wound up having to eat in my car but this was a small price to pay.   As for the food it was outstanding. I ordered the 1/2 slab and a side of mac and cheese. When I first saw the ribs I was a little thrown when they were spare ribs but I was over that almost immediately. They were smokey, spicy and tender. The sauce matched the ribs nicely.   Now I did make one mistake, I only ordered a small mac and cheese. Oh my word, I can't remember the last time I have had mac and cheese this good with out walking into my grandmother's house. It was perfect.  I love finding little whole-in-the-wall local places and this is what this is. It looks like a converted car wash which was a bit off putting but when I saw the billowing smoke from the back, I was sure I was in for a treat.

If you would like a healthier breakfast though, they have some delicious-looking energy bowls. I might try one on my days off.

I had made arrangements for someone to watch our daughter so we can have a fun evening as a couple. We love to try new places and after a little search, I found Taverna on groupon. The menu sounded wonderful and with it being in Broadripple, I thought this would be perfect opportunity to go to the Corner Wine Bar afterward.     This place is a little expensive and because of that, I though the atmosphere would would have been more intimate with cozy seating and dimmed lighting. Instead, an Applebees has a more romantic setting.   We were greeted with kindness, the service was really good, and the white sangria was fantastic which would have earned this place two stars but the way the lady handled my call, telling her my wife and I got food poisoning, made me take that other star away.    We ordered one pitcher of the sangria, calamari, we each had the 8oz filet mignon wrapped in bacon - my wife's portion was larger than mine with more sauce - and lastly tart for dessert. The calamari was really good, the meat was cooked to how we like it and and the meat by itself was really good. However my wife thought the blue cheese on her filet tasted funny and scrapped it off. We both love blue cheese too.   After our meals we got our dessert. It tasted awful and we could not finish it. However we were polite and didn't say anything. Now, if I was the server, I would have asked if anything was wrong with it because we only ate a couple bites and we didn't want the rest to take home. Oh well, the total damage was more than $100 but we had a groupon, taking a huge chunk of it away.   We sat at our table for a few more minutes after they cleared it and discussed going to our next location. Unfortunately, we didn't make it. Once we got into the car, we had to go home and it quickly went downhill.    I called the place on Saturday to tell them about our Friday night experience. The lady said that no one else had complained about their food, no one else got food poisoning and then acted like she didn't care. She didn't even say sorry.    Because this place has only been open for a little over a year and pricey, I would have expected someone to have handled this in a little nicer way.

Kids got chicken fingers and a burger which also taste frozen and the burger no joke tasted just like a frozen bubba burger you get from the store.

After being picked up, we waited for about 20min to wait for the other bus to come then about 20 people were transferred to our bus. By the time we really started the tour, it was an hour after the pick up time.   Payment issue - I called about the discount I'll get if I reserve online. The woman told me to do it otherwise I can't get it when paying in person. So I did it. But, then the driver, half way into the tour, said now everyone please line up to pay. He used a tiny portable credit card machine to process everyone's card. It was slow  SLOW! The bus was full that day and it was 90 degrees out. It took him about 45min to get everything done plus he was confused about two groups of people who happened to have the same last name.   Really? It's 2013 people! The company can't take payment online or over the phone?  Why ask your customer to waste valuable time?   Though I had the email proving I've paid online. I was told that it simply reserved my seats and wasn't the actual payment. So paid AGAIN and of course got charged TWICE! It has been over a week and I haven't got the refund.   Because of this delay, when we got to the second plantation, we had about a little over an hour left because the driver said we  must leave at 5.    He told us to go straight to the big house but gave us the WRONG time when the tour would start. So everyone waited about 15 minutes in line AGAIN instead of just enjoying the beautiful garden at Oak Alley. (The tour is boring and the stories aren't interesting. I'd recommend people just spend all the time in the garden) By the time we came out, it was almost time to get on the bus and head back to the French Quarter. So Disapppinting. We didn't get to visit the beautiful Oak Alley at all.    Give me my money back, Cajun Encounter!"", ""This place is a favourite of mine in the Fairmount/Francisville/Temple area. Got the turkey goat cheese baguette sandwich and the lady had the Philly baguette sandwich (lox and cream cheese w/ tomato). Food was delicious. Iced tea and iced chai latte were both amazing as well. Cute outdoor seating. Everything was super clean and tidy and the staff was super friendly. Highly recommended for a late breakfast or light lunch"", ""Many places in Philly claim to have the best cheesesteaks in town but this place really does! An there's a bonus to that as well...They have a special everyday of 3 Cheesesteaks for $13. An trust me you will not regret eating there. If cheesesteaks aren't your thing the pizza and pasta are equally wondeful.  You an your pals can get a good mow on for dirt cheap.  Trust me."", ""I wish I can rate them without a star. I am currently here at The Inn at Opryland, A Gaylord Hotel, we have been here since Wednesday Dec 27, 2017. It was Friday night (Dec 29, 2017), came back from a long trip got to our room and they did not clean the room, NO one clean our room. We called the front desk and we spoke to a man, called himself the \""\""manager\""\"" and instead of rectifying the situation, blaming us that we are at fault, because we left the sign on (DO NOT DISTURB). We did not have signed on at all. We wanted them to clean the room since we are going to be gone for the whole day and we place was really a mess when we left. The manager did not even apologize for their mistakes. We also did not have any clean towels to used. The management was arguing rather than fixing the problem. Today is Dec 30th, I went out of the door to find a housekeeper, one was walking in the hallway and I asked her a questions about our room, and she said \""\""sorry me no speak English\""\"" I knew she was lying. I should have called ICE (homeland investigation for undocumented).  I am writing this review because The Inn at Opryland only wants your money, they don't care about you. They don't care about your concern. until now no one came to clean and bother on our concern. I am from California, San Francisco Bay Area, this is my first and last time here. I was charge $249 a night and double during New Years. THIS IS A CRAP HOTEL. It is noisy, very small tub and bathroom. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE, go to Hyatt, Hampton, Holiday Inn Express, but NEVER HERE... STAY AWAY."", ""My partner and I love McAlisters, but not this one! The service is horrible!! The manager leads by example- he does not seem to care that customers were waiting to place orders. He and two other employees did not acknowledge us or the other customers for at least 10 minutes. When he did he acted annoyed. The dining room was a mess, the employees were too busy engaged in their own conversations. We/I will not come back to this location. Though it is convenient we will go to the one in Creve Coeur."", ""Gee, Normands. It would have been nice if you had seen fit to update your website with the fact that you are closed for construction during a good chunk of August.   That way, my husband and i wouldn't have wasted time trying you this morning. Good thing Craft Beer Market was open.   Seriously. Add a freaking contact page to your website with important stuff like hours and you know, CLOSURES?   Once my husband has been burned by a place, it is nearly impossible to get him to return, so chances are, you may have lost him (us) for good."", ""Went here on a Friday night awkward because no system for how to get a table. The margarita I had was really weak. Asked for extra limes and never got any. The chicken tacos are incredibly bland. Literally chicken and salsa verde nothing else, which would normally be okay, but the chicken didn't have any taste. Got charged $2 for a little cheese to put on my taco for taste. Ambience was cool and different, but everything else gets a thumbs down. Service was marginal at best. My friends had their orders messed up. First and last time coming."", ""outstanding food store, pricey but well worth it. If you crave it, they have it. I LOVE IT!"", ""The staff is very good at providing misinformation with, what I can only guess is, the objective of stretching out simple things into multiple, billable appointments. Be sure to show up on time so you can have the honor of waiting for netley d'souza to stroll by, in an unapologetic fashion, 45 minutes after your scheduled appointment. A word of caution, though. Do not suggest that his staff treat you with decency or that anyone other than yourself be punctual. Doctor d'souza will respond by having a staff member call you to tell you to find another doctor. If you're looking for integrity, punctuality, consideration for your time, a competent staff, a doctor who is on top of his game, or anyone to do anything other than give you a hard time or do more than the bare minimum, well, I guess you had better keep looking."", ""Worst customer service ever, food is par by far, dirty tables, nothing like a real New York slice, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is away from home in need of a slice of pie. I taste the time frame of some of the ingredients, Like they sat to long before being used. How could the great state of NY ever allow people who serve crappy food to use their name."", ""Went to have lunch and place had nice ambiance and service was very good and friendly. Then came the food. They had several options. I had the pick three of sausage, brisket and ribs. The two sides were beans and greens. Out of the three meats the sausage was the least worse. All were dry and the sides did not have favors I would expect. I did not like anything. You even had to pay for bread.  I tried covering them up with the bbq sauces however even those were strange tasting. The sweet was pure molasses. The house was the only one I could tolerate.  I think they need to hire a cook that has tastebuds. We tried the apple crumble pie for desert and we even threw that away as it had no sweetness at all and no texture.  The price was crazy. Never again. Go to one of the many BBQ places in St. Louis that actually has good food."", ""Been here twice now.  Both times I ordered a caesar salad with chicken, and both times it was a bust.  Some of the produce was wilted, browning and bitter, and just doused in dressing beyond anything reasonable.  Counter service was so-so.  First time I went in, there were two staff members taking their time.  I was third in line, and it took almost 20 minutes to walk out with my to-go order.  Second time I was in, there was literally no one behind the counter or anywhere in sight for almost 10 minutes.    No bueno, Fresh Bar.  Thanks anyway."", ""Had to wait over 2 hours for food! Delivery drivers don't know their way around and can't seem to knock on a door. This store is pathetic. I will NEVER order from this location again."", ""I would shut this location down. Every drive threw order is 5 min or longer. Who manages this place? I'm done trying to eat there."", ""Won't go back. Service was great, but the food was awful. All 6 in our party were disappointed. both Chicken parm entrees were very salty and greasy. Chicken sandwich had soggy bun. Fish and chips were soggy as well. Bistro burger was dry.   Would be great to drink beer and watch the game."", ""If I could give zero stars I would. I never ever have had such an experience at an establishment. I came here with a group of 8 for a birthday dinner. We had more than 1 server. I have no idea what any of their names were. They give NO REFILLS on anything (soda, tea, lemonade, etc) which I think is insane! So they recommend buying a pitcher. The pitchers and ice bucket were both in plastic containers you can get from the dollar store.   We wait nearly 2 hours for our food. Majority of our party ordered mac & cheese as a side. Once we got our plates we noticed their was shrimp in our mac & cheese. When we questioned our server, she responded \""\""Oh I thought she told you we ran out\""\"". Mind you, that is completely fine, but what if someone had a seafood allergy?   To top it off, 2 of our party members (birthday girl included) did not receive their meals. They didn't even check back at the table until we flagged them down to report the missing plates. Our server then responded, \""\""I honestly don't even know what you ordered\""\"". We didn't even finish our food and the birthday girl didn't even want to eat them to even bother making her food since we had waited so long and they were closing. We asked to speak to a manager and was told they would come. When they didn't, we asked again. At this time, our \""\""server\""\"" (the same one we asked to get a manager) claimed she was the manager. WHICH WE KNEW WAS A LIE.   I understand they have just opened but theres no way an establishment should be run this way. Our entrees came out on glass plates, but everything else was on paper plates.   I WOULD NOT recommend this establishment to anyone. They didn't apologize or seem interested in good customer service."", ""Over the summer I ordered from here without incident. Then comes fall and a particularly cold evening.  We placed our order or tried at first. My friend repeated the order three times.  The repeated her card number 2 times.  Then became tired of repeating my address.  I gave them my address the 4th time.  We were told we'd get our Indian goodness in 30 - 45 minutes.  Not a problem.  We were fine with waiting.  We thought the repeating-ourselves-thing was pretty comical until...  Over an hour later we had no Indian goodness.  We called the restaurant.  We let them know the time frame they gave us and that it was well past that time frame.  The person on the phone didn't seem to understand \""\""we've been waiting over an hour.  Can you tell us if the driver is near?\""\""  Several times.  This time the repetition wasn't comical.  Then came Irate Guy On Phone.  \""\""DO YOU WANT YOUR FOOD!? DO YOU WANT YOUR FOOD!? WHY DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHERE THE DRIVER IS!? WHY!?\""\""  My friend and I looked at each other as if to ask what just happened while Irate Guy On Phone kept screaming \""\""DO YOU WANT YOUR FOOD!?,\""\"" Etc.    Driver finally showed up while this phone call was taking place.  My friend collected the food and paid the tab.    The food, mediocre.  Before to night I was fine with waiting to get it on the latter end of the stated time.  Tonight, a little late because of a lovely nor'easter but the person who answered the phone left such a rotten taste in my mouth that next time I will get into my wheels and haul my butt to pick up from a much better restaurant with less abusive service.  Bad service made the mediocre food... meh. Portions or naan and poori: fail.  Yeeeeeaaahhh. No. Will I order take out or delivery again from this establishment? Nope.  In short, Tandoor India, you bite and not the way I like."", ""Absolutely terrible customer service. I am for sure ranting here... Asked for a happy hour menu on one of my visits. The lady bartender said it was happy hour and she would get me a menu. Ordered fried pickles and a beer from the menu. Went to pay my bill an hour later and the dude with the long beard behind the bar rung me up. My bill was for normal price (and overpriced). He said the order was put it at 3:59 it looked like. He was a total jerk about it with no forgiveness after I told him I was led to believe it was happy hour. Needless to say there was no tip!  I went back, a few days later, shockingly. Ordered a cocktail. A simple old fashioned with brandy. I asked for soco and they didn't have it. So i asked for brandy. Cocktail was good. Get the bill later ... $12 cocktail. For real! It wasn't even an 8oz cocktail. More like a 4oz! And there was a $4 bogus charge on there which i was unaware about when ordering and that long bearded guy again behind the bar told me what it was for after the fact (something to do with adding a higher liquor quantity). I wouldn't have wanted that in the first place!! So again, no forgiveness and forced to pay that bill. Again, zero tip.   otherwise, you can get takeout beer here and the outdoor couches are ok. But customer service really blows!!! they're so slow and unforgiving and confusing ! I hope that long bearded guy is not a manager. Very pathetic"", ""I went in on a Sunday morning to pick up a few desserts for a family gathering at the Center City location..  I saw Baklava, and was told not to purchase them by the sales associate (and I appreciate her honesty) because they were hard as a rock..  I then purchased to cakes, a Pound cake, and a peanut butter mousse cake.  Everyone was looking forward to the peanut butter cake.  EVERYONE TOOK A BITE AND SPIT IT OUT!  IT WAS STALE.  The chocolate was ok, but the mousse has a horrible RANK taste, and SMELL as well.  It tasted and smelled  like spoiled cream cheese.  It wasn't one of those things that taste like something, IT WAS SPOILED.  Even the partial peanut butter cups on the top tasted stale!!!  The pound cake was ok, nothing special..  Needless to say, the experience of tasting spoiled food makes me never to return again!"", ""Perfect local experience. This is the kind of corner bar that everyone should wander into in every place she visits."", ""This nightclub is complete let down. The music was a train wreck. The dj would play a good song for 10 seconds then mix to another song that was completely off the wall like a train wreck. I would go to dance floor to start dancing and by the time I made it the song was changed.  I was in the club Fri and Sat night and dj played same mix. The dj acted like. he was mixing but never had his headphones on. Hey mister dj u suck learn to dj better. Here is a tip play music longer and don't change songs .

Then I pulled up the coupon and she said it's only for students and that I needed a student ID. However the coupon said nothing about this. Then she switched to saying the coupon is expired, yet it's still on YELP and they're website. She also said they won't honor the $75 for 45$ coupon you can literally purchase on yelp either.

The entire experience was underwhelming from start to finish.  Their website which is fairly useless if you want to figure out the menu before going, you have to pick your location choice out of 3 locations and then drill down to the bottom to see the weak descriptions of their menu offering, no explanations and no price, just this      Roast Beef     Roast Beef Combo     Roast Pork     Roast Pork Combo     Baked Ham     Baked Ham Combo     Roast Turkey     Roast Turkey Combo     Broccoli Rabe     Broccoli Rabe Combo   No explanation of whats in a combo (its just where they add cheese by the way)  The table placecard (instead of menu) had a more detailed description than the website.

Since I couldnt decide and the sandwiches werent too expensive at $6.85, I got the roast beef and roast port combos.  I got my two sandwiches fast enough, but the roast beef was cold and the roast pork was hot.  Not sure how a cook (for lack of a better word) could serve 2 things at the same time with such a temperature differential, one was obviously sitting for awhile.  I asked the waitress to reheat the roast beef while I finished the roast pork, and supposedly it was reheated, since it was warmer, but it was still cold-ish compared to my roast pork I had just finished.  The waitress did offer to replace it when she inquired, but I was in a hurry and didnt really care for a hot version of this sandwich.  The sandwiches were very skimpy on meat, but they \""\""made up for it\""\"" by adding too much gravy to make it overly messy and the bread was disintegrating.  The menu place card mentions the \""\""wet meat\""\"" option where you get less gravy, I strongly recommend you get it that style, especially if the gravy overpower the meat and structural integrity of the sandwich."", ""Great place.

An Eggplant dish with tomatoes, onion, and a spice blend that sent it over the edge with flavor. The portion size was large and left me with leftovers I can't wait to dig into.   I was surprised at how dead the restaurant was for 7pm. As we were there other people starting making their way in. Restaurants don't stay in this location for very long. I'm not sure why. But, I hope this one is here to stay. Definitely check it out."", ""A neighborhood cafe with GREAT soul food. We went for the lunch buffet and it did not disappoint. The fried chicken was crispy and well seasoned, the white beans had chunks of ham and sausage that put it over the top (in a good way!), the greens were very hammy and tasty...and I didn't even have room to try it all. The bread pudding was tempting but I was done at that point. Very friendly service!"", ""These people are so RUDE! I will never go there again!

She also cut me !! My fill looks horrible ! She was very  rude !! They ended up charging me $24 how ?? Idk never going there again !! I will be calling them tomorrow for a full refund or I will press charges after all she knows she messed up because after she pulled my arm she said \""\"" sorry \""\"" and kept arguing !!

The atmosphere is cool but when you bite into the burger it is such a let down. Their overpriced burgers (and sides) are so disappointing that it brings tears to my eyes. Nobody in my party enjoyed their eats and nobody would come back.   The burgers sounds delicious from the description but in reality they are boring, dry, and void of any sort of flavor. I don't know how the Century Group can keep these locations afloat let alone keep expanding.   It's really not that hard to make even a decent burger and somehow Deluxe Burger Bar fails. DO NOT GO."", ""If you're white and dance to EDM don't bother coming here.   The tall (6'6\""\""+) african-american bouncer kicked me out when I came out of the bathroom, after I had been there for only 2 songs, saying \""\""I need to talk to you outside\""\"" then proceed to say \""\""girls are complaining you're dancing up on them\""\"" I have a strict policy of NOT dancing up on girls or even initiating eye contact! (I have a firm opinion that most[not all] girls in clubs are attention whores, gold diggers and snobs - as such I do not go there for them! I go to have a good time enjoying the music). Obviously this accusation was complete BS. I can only assume the bouncers hater homies were not happy at all on the crowd of girls who circled up around me when I started getting down. I asked to speak to the manager who tried to pass off some BS excuses for his employees misbehavior and invited me back in, but my cab had already arrived to take me away from this POS, likewise I refused to come back into the club. The manager proceeded to tell me \""\""I don't care about Yelp or TripAdvisor reviews\""\"" when I informed him I write online reviews  ... LOL! OK .. so what I have to say back here on the internet is: good luck bud. I won't be back & have a lovely career seeing as you don't understand the power of the internet! We yelpers stick together.  Piece of advice guy: don't let your employees play favorites with your patrons, I hope your club works out for the best... bon voyage!  I will spend my $$$,$$$.$$ (hint, hint) elsewhere like at the Push Ultra Lounge where I wont get discriminated against for being male, tall, white and cheered on by attractive females.

Everytime I went to this store, just to look mostly, the staff were stuck up and one girl was even telling me how to hold a book so I don't break the binding. She even told me I have to pay for it if I hold it wrong. It was so odd that I just left and never went back. When I was in highschool, in the late 90's, this store was great but being grown up now I expect better service. Maybe they've changed but after over 10 visits of the same crummy service I'm not sure I want to find out."", ""Slum Lords of the worth kind.  Don't expect your security deposit back. If you so much as put a hole in the wall to hang a picture they will charge you for damaging the property.

If you try to pay online that will cost a fee, but they won't tell you, just so they can get more money.  They also do not upkeep their properties well. Our roof leaked and the air conditioning didn't work. They would not replace it or pay someone properly to fix the roof. They are slum lords of the worth. They will take your money and claim you ruined their place without proper evidence. Do not trust them. I don't care how bad you need a place, they will mistreat you and steal your security deposit.

She has been a great visionary and help in my life and I have grown so much with her advice and readings and she has been an invaluable source of strength .

I went here late in the day hoping to score a cupcake (or two), but they were all out. Which turned out to be a boon because I probably would have overlooked the pudding otherwise. We were offered samples of banana pudding, peanut butter pudding, and strawberry banana pudding, each as delicious as the last. This stuff is like the H\u00e4agen-Dazs of pudding: rich, creamy, and indulgent. In fact, it's closer to eating custard-y ice cream than any pudding you've ever had. We'll definitely be back for more since the two containers we took home with us are sadly already gone."", ""The Margaritas were yummy!  And I have never liked Margaritas. Lol. My mom had the regular on the rocks and I had Mango over Paris which consisted of peach snapps, tequila and mango pieces small enough to fit through the straw right into my mouth. Ingenious!!  They were $7.50 and $9.25 roughly each. Well worth it especially since they had a country guitar player there playing older songs. Fun time!"", ""Cannot believe this adorable spot tucked away in the mountains. The tri tip sandwich did not disappoint. Not sure I even got a photo of it before it ended up in my tummy."", ""Went here Easter of 2018 for the first time and had a blast! I absolutely love it here and plan on returning before I move. We went Sunday evening and the place was definitely booming. If you just want to order the tri tip sandwich (which I highly recommend because it was delicious) you won't need a reservation. I believe they stop serving the tri tip around 5, but I could be wrong. I made reservations for dinner in case my friends wanted something besides tri tip. Overall, they enjoyed their dinner but I think they would have been happier with just the sandwich because it was on point. We stayed to enjoy the atmosphere and live music. This place didn't disappoint."", ""I been to a lot of places but this place was gross. I am sorry to say but there was hair in my good and the waitress was rude."", ""I would give this place negative stars if possible... and I would like to know when people actually went here!? Where were the short lines? The brilliant employees who made jokes and whimsically processed your organized paperwork? Where were the birds singing merrily?   1. There are never any parking spaces in the small parking lot.  2. The people here are the rudest people I have ever come across, and that factors in for the fact that they have to work at the DMV and deal with idiots all day  Let's see --first visit the person at the front desk turned me away because I didn't know you needed to bring a personal check or money order and wouldn't even let me get a number if didn't show her I had all my documents were ready to be processed- well I thought,  ok the website doesn't say you only take checks but OK, this is my fault and they mean business here!   Second visit I was told the wait was 2 hours - they are only open during the hours I work 8:30-4:30 so basically you have to miss work to go to the location in South Philly. I had to go back to work so I, yet again, assumed it was on me to figure out how to do this the right way. I'll try again, I told myself.  Third visit I was prepared - I had all my paperwork--took 2 hours off work- and I was told the wait was 1 hour 23 minutes. I'm going to do this!! I was number 748 and they were on number 730 when I sat down. Score! Over an hour later, the TWO people working there had only gotten through 4 people. One woman spent the whole time waiting on the same person who looked like he handed her a paperclip and a plastic bag and she made all kinds of calls to try to get his documentation (remember I can't even get in the building without showing mine)... the other person working there, while he was moving at a faster pace, took 2 people in a row who didn't have numbers. Then a man came over and said \""\""My sister so and so is coming\""\"" and the woman nodded. 15 minutes later, the line hadn't moved at all and just before the man called the next number (number 735- still nowhere near me ) a woman comes up and announces she is so and so's sister and with no number, no line, no waiting, gets to go and give her paperwork in and was promptly waited on. Now, after 90 minutes and the line only moving 5 people my patience was wearing very thin. I complained about what was going on and I was told that \""\""oh honey those people were here earlier and lost their numbers\""\"" OH YEA RIGHT. Then the woman finishes with \""\""paperclip no documents man\""\"" and announces she is \""\""going on break\""\"" and gets up and walks around and starts playing with so and so's sister's baby while she gets waiting on and the rest of us sit there like total fools.   I left and will never go back. If you no choice but to go to this location, take a day off work and get there as soon as they open. Also know that your number means nothing and the wait will be over 2 hours. And no one will be nice. Or try and make friends with someone who works there and that way you don't even need a number."", ""This place sucks! The one up on oracle and wetmore is where I usually go, however, I moved and the university location is closer. Sorry Silver mine you have lost my business forever.  First, I ordered two sandwiches a large homesteak  with no green onions. I accidentally typed onions instead of peppers that come on the sandwich. These bozos still proceed to put the greens on it and the manager laughs it off like no big deal.  Second, my hot homesteak sandwich was as cold as if had been sitting out for an hour. You guessed right it took an hour to get my food and then the hot sandwich was not wrapped in the proper wrapping to keep it warm. Lastly, the employee got rude with me when I was checking to see what time my order would be done. He proceeded to scold me about how he only got it two minutes ago and it will be done when its done. Not how you talk to a customer buddy!  Goodbye Silver mine!"", ""This place was extremely good, definitely one of the best ramen places I've been to. There was plenty of food and the rice beer was good. There was a line but it moved quickly and they let you look at the menu while in line so the service was quick.   They should look into getting hot sake for sale bombs though."", ""I had to plan a friends' bridal shower from Alaska, and was not familiar with any of the catering places in Wayne or the surrounding area. I'm sure glad I found Crocodile! They made everything so easy to coordinate from a distance, and were so friendly when I chatted with them on the phone about my order. The food was a hit at the bridal shower! One of the attendants was a vegetarian and said her vegetarian sandwich was the best she's ever had from a deli. The only negative, if you even want to refer to it as that, was the delivery came a half an hour early, and we had to stuff everything in the fridge so it wouldn't sit out for an hour before people showed up. Again, it wasn't really a negative since I would rather they have been early than late! I wish I lived in Wayne so I could eat at Crocodile and use their services more, they were great!"", ""Absolutely Amazing cake for my sons birthday. We had a space theme party and the cake was perfect in every way !"", ""Came here on a day it wasn't busy at all and they food was still on point! Little expensive but well worth it, whatever that sauce is I tried to put on everything, the Mac and cheese, rice, chicken, cabbage everything!"", ""I'm not sure why I'm writing this since you can just look at every other review written for this place and get the exact same story.   My wife was literally grabbed, like actually literally grabbed, by the face the second she stepped in the door. The culprit was a big-tittied shot girl that proceeded to dump a bunch of piss water down her throat. Then I was informed I owed her $24. When I refused to pay I was told the police were being called. My wife, not wanting to spend our trip coming to pick me up at the police station, (which is where I gladly would have gone rather than give a penny to these shady-ass MFers), swiped my wallet from my pocket and paid the bill.   Everybody there from the door guys to the managers to the bathroom attendants are the worst, most sketchy people on Bourbon Street.

My coworkers and I sat down to order right around 1 pm and did not get our food until 1:45!!!  Completely unacceptable, considering we only had an hour for lunch & we were the only 4 customers in the place!!!!  We immediately had to pay our bills and put our food directly into to-go boxes...which is not awesome when you order the home made fries, and they become soggy on the ride back to work.  My burger was delicious (once I got a break at the office to actually take a bite). The server was pretty unapologetic about the whole situation, and I really felt like we were a huge inconvenience for him.  If there hadn't been upbeat, Latin music playing throughout the restaurant, I would have mistaken this place for the waiting room at my gynecologist's office....no fun!"", ""The little deli belongs in little Italy. Wonderful subs, pastas, desserts and deli items. TOP NOTCH subs.  Always busy so don't be a douche and give a 1 star review because your delivery took too long. Call ahead for pick up. After coworkers see you eating anything from here, they will want in next time you go."", ""Had to check out this spot seen on every YouTube vlog ever. Luckily for us, our Airbnb was only 2 blocks away!  When you walk inside, you can purchase bottles of wine and cheese to enjoy outside. If you'd like to try their tapas, head outside and order at the window. There's also a bar serving other drinks upstairs.  They have live music every night at 7:30pm.

That's it for the positive.  It is a Sunday...Fathers Day and only place in town with no brunch wait.  Our first signal.  They didn't have enough menus when we were seated.  It took 25 minutes for one of drinks to arrive.  My wife's coffee was cold and full of grounds.  Food arrived.  My omelet was cooked to death, never got my toast or fruit.  Everyone else got waffles.  They were chewy like they had been re heated.  Only two small things of syrup.  No butter or sugar on my wife's. Her eggs were scrambled rather than over hard.

Regina was great, but the real star of the show was Chrissy, the makeup and skincare expert at the salon. Chrissy did my mom's makeup first and made her look so glamorous, and explained each product and process step by step and took my mom's adorably earnest questions in stride.    When Chrissy did my makeup, she suggested a few bold choices and I agreed to see how her vision might work in addition to what I had been originally thinking. I was looking for a very retro look but she had the brilliant idea of punching it up with a more modern lip color, and she was SO RIGHT. it was instantly like having a friend do my makeup -- we chatted and laughed throughout the whole application process.

I texted my friend asking her what time we should go so I knew when to cook dinner and she told me to hold off dinner - I was going to get stuffed at this event.  She was dead wrong.  When we arrived around 7:30 we found it super packed. Long long times, tight crowds, lots of dogs and babies. We circled the event trying to pick out which line we were going to devote our entire night to standing in, and decided on the Jamaican truck. After an hour of standing in line, and having other line go-ers friends casually jip us, we finally made it to the front to order only to have the vendor announce they were out of all of my meal options.  So you know what I had for dinner the evening of Night Market? A bag of chips from CVS.  This event had it's potential. But I guess they were not counting on the ridiculous horde of hungry people. Most trucks were placing \""\""SOLD OUT\""\"" signs just as we were arriving. There were very few vegetarian/vegan options... (actually, don't believe any food vendors had vegan options). Hopefully next time they will be able to work out their kinks."", ""I'd been here before, when it was blue sea, so I thought it would be similar as before. I was surprised to see a new menu, but the old owner. I guess it's a name change only. Anyway, I ordered just 2 rolls, the volcano roll, as described in another yelper's review, was amazing. However, the second roll I ordered was eel & cucumber. It was almost not edible. I ate 1 of the 6 pieces, and it just tasted funky. Spoiled eel. When I asked for the check, as I was disgusted, the woman asked me if I wanted a box to take home my un-eaten roll. I declined and said it did not taste \""\""right\""\"". She smiled and took it away. She came back with my bill, which included both rolls. I paid it and left. I won't go back. Too bad. It's so easy to be great at customer service. They missed the boat."", ""I ordered a premium flower arrangement from Southtown Florists (formerly Kabloom of Reno) website for Valentine's Day for my fiance. The website shows a rather nicely done arrangement described online as \""\""Red roses and carnations are exquisitely arranged with white asiatic lilies and chrysanthemums.\""\""   What was delivered to my fiance was a train wreck. The arrangement was a bunch of filler green stuff and those little tiny white garbage sprigs, some carnations, daisies and what appears to be two or three roses. For $90 plus dollars I feel like I was taken, and because of that I won't be using this florist again. If I could submit photos I would, just plain sad."", ""If a customer goes through the trouble of choosing a specific hair style, shares three photographs of someone modeling the exact hairdo, and discusses it at length with the hairdresser, then it should stand to reason that the customer receives that hair style. Not in this case. I must have caught her on a bad day.  Liberty took it upon herself to cut an extra six inches off my curly hair, which I didn't see until the haircut was complete because she had me facing away from the mirror as she worked.

Thought that would transfer to this location - not at all.  To sum it up, our server was extremely energetic, but not in a good way. More like a frantic energy. I was there to enjoy a few drinks and dinner with a friend who was visiting (AKA looking to spend money AKA you will get a larger tip if you let us stay longer) and we were rushed out. Server brought boxes for food we were still eating, without asking if we wanted them. A few minutes later he physically put the food in the boxes at the tableside while mumbling something like \""\""I don't like food sitting on the table.\""\"" .....we didn't even want to take it home. Next, when we said we were having another friend join for another round or two of drinks he told us we couldn't stay at the booth we were at and we needed to go to the bar. What? I point blank asked him if he was kicking us out of the booth and he said \""\""yes!\""\"" energetically. There was no one waiting for tables and there were numerous open tables/booths around the restaurant. I felt extremely uncomfortable and wanted to leave immediately. Our friend joined after all this happened, and when the server came over to ask if they wanted a drink, he seemed surprised when we told him we were just going to leave. YOU LITERALLY just told us we couldn't sit at this table any longer!! We then left.  I worked in restaurants for a long time and I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to restaurant service. I was not pleased at all during this visit.  On another note, the food was not that great."", ""We received a coupon for a buy one-get-one, so we decided to try this place. We go to Qdoba all the time, so I thought this would be a similar experience.   Service: All of the staff we interacted with, while placing our food order, were very polite and upbeat. We took our food to go as we live a two minute drive away.   Food: I ordered a chicken burrito bowl and my husband ordered a steak burrito with fajita veggies. I was eating in the home office and bit into quite a few cold chicken pieces. I ate around the chicken as I have an unnatural fear of food poisoning. We live very close to the restaurant, so either the container the chopped chicken in was cold, or the meat was not cooked all the way. I went to go check on my husband in the living room and he stopped eating all together. Half way through his burrito, he found a 4 or so inch long brown hair. Yay for finding hair in your food! I asked him if he wanted me to call the restaurant and he said no. He just tossed his food, as did I.   Four hours later and my stomach is still not agreeing with me.

The driver got lost trying to find the CalTrain station in Sacramento and drove for over one hour on the surface streets of Sacramento, wandering and looking for the station in residential areas. Passengers tried to help her with directions from smart phones, but she wans't interested in any assistance. By the time we pulled into the station over an hour late, we could smell that something was overheating. First the driver claimed it was the system to open the luggage doors, as these were not working and could not be opened to offload and reload passengers luggage. She finally got that to work, and told us we would have to wait for a hot tire to cool off. Eventually all seemed well, and we left. Within 5 minutes of getting on the freeway, the driver yanked the bus over to the side while slamming on the brakes. There was an offramp approzimately 20 feet from the front of the bus, no idea why she didn't pull off the freeway. She announced the same tire was overheating and it was not safe to take the bus to San Francisco. Then she took the offramp and parked in a shopping center. Told us it would take at least an hour for a new bus to be brought to us, plus time to unload and reload the luggage. Meanwhile, the passengers start getting off the bus to smoke, buy a soda at the convenience store, etc. The driver came unglued and ordered everyone back on the bus, no one could stand outside except the smokers that were smoking with her.And the replacement was not a megabus, no wi-fi, etc. The portapotty called a bathroom was filthy, burn your shoes if you have to use it. The trip back was slightly better, also very late and had a stop to explore a smell coming from the bus. After my experience, I will pay to fly Southwest into Oakland and take BART into the city. I have no confidence that these bus drivers could handle a real emergency while driving and did not feel safe."", ""Tried to go there the other night but got stopped at the door for wearing boots even though I've been there a dozen times with boots on and other people were going in and out wearing boots."", ""Ick.  That sums up my experience at Dinardo's in one \""\""word.\""\""  Dinardo's gave me that \""\""Ick\""\"" vibe the minute I set my foot in the door.

This would have been fine because a lot of times the \""\""run down\""\"" places have the best \""\""authentic food,\""\"" but this was not the case at Dinardo's.  At Dinardo's you do not get what you pay for as the prices are rather high and the food quality is rather low.    Our server hated his life and made snarky, mean comments throughout our time there which, though entertaining, was kind of unwelcome and unpleasant.  My friend had the mussels which were puny and in an unimpressive sauce--unimpressive being the general adjective I would use to describe any given dish my party ordered.  I had a soup which was extremely salty and bland beyond that and the broiled flounder and \""\""seafood imperial\""\"" dishes were OK at best.   I'd say if you're looking for good seafood you'd be better off at any BYOB; little fish, audrey claire, ANYWHERE but Dinardo's.

He insisted that meatball subs only get three meatballs and when I challenged him and inquired as to why that was he got very rude very quickly. As my sub was in the oven I decided to look up subway's website and, lo and behold, meatball subs DO get four meatballs, just like every other time I have gotten a sub from that store. When I informed him of this and asked for another meatball he stomped over, smashed two more meatballs into my sandwich, and snippily finished the order even after I informed him I didn't want to cause any trouble.  There are some wonderful people who work at this Subway. That guy was not one of them and the experience was enough to put me off that store completely. I'm not expecting five star service from a Subway but when you try to take advantage of your customers and then get angry when they call you out on it, maybe you aren't meant for a job that involves customer interaction.

She said that this will take 40 minutes to make it ready. She pointed to a group of people sitting of about 25 persons and implied that they were busy making food for them. Afterwards, I asked her what about just a regular appetizer like hummus and baba gannoush. She again said that they need 40 minutes to prepare it! Also she pointed at the same group of people with her finger.  At that point I just left the restaurant.  It is horrendous that they needed 40 minutes to prepare hummus!!

I now work with disabled persons trying to help them find employment. We're not supposed to meet them in their home as per company policy. My client, who is disabled, and I have visited this pizzeria a few times per her request because it's close to her house and she feels comfortable meeting there. Today we went in at 1:45pm and I noticed it was busier than usual (typically we go at a time where it is not busy restaurant hours.) Before going to sit down like we normally do, and again this was only our third time here, We were greeted aggressively and immediately by who I assume is the owner. I started to ask \""\""do you mind if we sit here..\""\"" and was cut off. He said, \""\""I have a real problem with you coming in here not buying anything and sitting taking up a table for 2-3 hours.\""\"" (Mind you, we have never been there the previous 2 times over an hour and 15 minutes - as I have a limited amount of time I am able to work with each client.  There also has been about 15 other open tables in the restaurant each time we were there, including today.) This person responded very hostile and aggressive. Had the gentleman asked politely if I purchased a drink or a slice of pizza we could sit and go about our business, however he met me with an extremely volatile attitude and aggressive choice of words. Again, as someone who's worked in the food industry, I understand how it can be frustrating for someone to come in and sit without purchasing anything. With that said, how this employee decided to treat me in this moment made me and my disabled client extremely uncomfortable. The rudeness was completely unnecessary and being familiar with the industry I wouldn't have minded at all purchasing something from this place in order to sit there for an hour, had I been spoken to appropriately. The part I feel the worst about is how my client was treated. I had to explain to her why \""\""that man was so rude\""\"". It's unacceptable how me and my client were made to feel today. She's already treated differently in the world and she felt terrible after this interaction. I'm mortified that this had to happen in this way, and this whole situation could have been completely avoided had we been treated like human beings. What the employee was trying to say was completely justified, however we were yelled at and made to feel like we were unwelcome for no reason whatsoever. I will not be entering this restaurant again for obvious reasons, and I encourage anyone who has any empathy for disabled persons to do the same. Again, the way we were treated was completely reprehensible and could have been avoided completely."", ""Walked in for the first time after a drink next door at Tinto (which was very nice and the bartender was pleasant, Dan). Squeezed us in at a small round for 2. Ordered a Blanton's rocks and they were out. Went with our second choice and the drinks never came. Server was too busy talking to other tables. He was overwhelmed with the amount of tables he had I think. We never got our drinks so we got up and left without ordering dinner."", ""This place just seems like the disney world of cafe shops. It's fanciful and unique but crowded. Trying to navigate the deli bar was extremely frustrating BUT it was not for the workers. Some people just do not understand the concept of pulling numbers and then stepping out of the way to be polite. However, the workers behind the counter were poised and courteous despite the onslaught. The great staff stood out in other areas as well! In the wine room and the cheese room I was helped by two men who were eager to answer questions, hold a conversation about their respective areas, and make me feel great even though I had little knowledge. I never felt rushed and I felt well-taken care of even though I was young and I definitely don't look rich.  Great place. When I am back in town I will definitely keep going for the section of foods and service.   Deli food: 4/5- Great for how inexpensive and mass made it is. Nothing really made me excited but it all tasted good.  Gelato: 4/5- Small varieties but very tasty.  Cheese: 5/5 - There's so much cheese! And the guy behind the counter really knows his stuff and will help you understand the differences between all those stinky rinds! Wine: 5/5- Good selection and multiple staff members seemed to know what they were talking about, including the location and story of many wineries.  Market: 5/5- tons of imported items and variety.   Bottom line: It's crowded but worth it. Probably best to skip lunch time on the weekends if you don't like crowds. Very helpful staff.

I have a background in cosmetology so I already know how to do hair, but for lazy purposes I like to go to a salon for my own head. I came on a walk in day and was in and out which I liked. The salon was clean and the staff was pretty friendly. A stylist named Erica did my sew in and girl named Chante did my braids. Both lady's did a great job. I really liked that Erica did not leave too much space in between my tracks which some salons tend to do. She also paid a lot of attention to my leave out. Instead of giving my leave out a basic flat iron on top, she took her time and blended it right. You can tell she cares about her work. Will recommend to my friends and will most likely revisit. 4 stars since they charge $20 more for each bundle added after 2. Don't get me wrong I'm not cheap but 3 bundles is equivalent to 2 packs of beauty supply hair if you think about it so thats one charge I didn't quite understand. Nonetheless still a decent sew in for under a $100.    Now for an updated review: If you don't care about being in an unfriendly and unprofessional environment, this would be the perfect salon for you. Yes, it is a cheap & affordable alternative than going to other high end salons in the area BUT this place is not what it used to be. I loved this salon before but I'm not sure if the management changed or the stylists just stopped giving a rats ass. For one, when you walk in the salon YOU DON'T feel the least bit welcomed. The receptionist is beyond ratchet. Like BEYOND! From gossiping to outright falling asleep at the desk. Yes, falling asleep! For two, none of the good stylists with the exception of one named Carl even works here anymore. I wish that I could post pictures of how bad my hair came out but since I started taking it out as soon as I hopped in my car I can't. $100.00 down the drain. The stylist who did my hair was named Brandy. Brandy took THREE HOURS to do a sew in. A bad one at that. My braids were loose and bumpy. The tracks were spread so far apart! She had a nice attitude but the poor baby just didn't know what she was doing. She said that she went to beauty school but the only thing she did good was cut my bang. The rest looked absolutely horrible. She told me she had only been there for two weeks and that should have been que to get up.

It was awesome to the connection.  It never surprises me that each location has its own unique merchandise items to call their own.  Who doesn't want a sign that says, \""\""I'm the woman to blame\""\"" ?  The food is good, but the margaritas are better."", ""Huge hotel with shops and small restaurants ($$).  There's short indoor walking distance to the auditorium and ball room.  The hotel accommodated patrons visiting for graduations, proms, bridal parties, clubs, etc.  Many atriums for chilling out and walking.  The hotel has a community feel and at times felt like cruise ship when walking by the rooms.  Fully staffed and had a nice lobby.  My favorite was the island style restaurant with the lamps all around.  Many spots for photos."", ""Absolutely the worst meal I've had in a very long time. Everything was super greasy, salad was old and wilted and I spent more time picking out the rotten pieces of lettuce than I did attempting to eat it. The ranch dressing, honey mustard and \""\""roadhouse\""\"" dipping sauce were all disgusting. The fries and chicken tenders were not only greasy but looked and tasted like someone's leftover lunch from yesterday that they over cooked in a microwave.  Again, worst meal ever!"", ""Amazing!

I stop by every time I crave for boba tea. Also, their egg puff is good too! You can have it with or without ice cream."", ""Tasting for our wedding cakes. Tasted 3 gluten free flavors - chocolate, vanilla, pina colada. And 5 regular flavors. Was a nice tasting experience.

Only problem I think they heat the room too much they need to think about how many students there are then heat accordingly"", ""Is it okay to say this is my favorite brunch spot even though all I've ever had here is their grits? I would definitely try one of their other courses and I'm pretty sure they're amazing, but it is so hard to not get my favorite thing off their menu! Their portion is so huge, i usually share it with another person (if I'm not being greedy)! You can literally top anything onto your dish and they vary from .50 cents to 1.00 dollar.  I love to add on avocados, red bell peppers, bacon, cheddar, and mushrooms! Their grits are incredible, it is not grainy nor watery. It's just perfect. I can go on and on. but I'm pretty sure you get the point!   Eventually, i will try their other dishes, but for now, it's all about their grits."", ""I went in for my first massage yesterday and saw Shelly. It was THE BEST hour of my life.I will be back."", ""I've been here several times and my cat Toothless is under one of their Wellness Plans. The vet techs and vets are always very nice and helpful when it comes to checking her in, and unless there's a difficult case ahead of me, the check in is always quick and easy. They're also very good about contacting me when someone new or a potential problem comes up, and they call if they need to run any other checks. The price is a little much which is an issue with any vet that I've noticed, but they always treat Toothless very well and I've never had any problems with them.""]",21
25,"[""Went here with a friend after having an incredible experience at Laurel and was hoping for more of the same at a slightly less bulgy pricepoint, and oh my, is it worth it...    ITV is the kind of place that i dream about, beautiful small room, dimly lit but you can see ( as opposed to some places) and you want to see everything.  Everything in the room is beautiful including a lot of the staff, (im trying to give you the full picture here).   First thing to hit the table (or bar in this case) was a three dollar beef fat biscuit that was the best thing ive eaten in this city all year.  I verbally communicated that message to Chef Nick Elmi who graced us with his presence in the dining room (just as before at Laurel).    We went on to eat many more things which i will try to name now... Stars were Foie with Apricot Miso, Pork Cheeks with some insanely good vegetables, trout pumpernickel soldiers and one of the best cocktails ive had in a damn long time, the ouroboros.   The are playing around with cold smoking things in there and on their BAR MENU!   Honestly, place is just terrific and i meant to write this review sooner but hey... better late than never.  Now that i think of it, im getting hungry... maybe ill head to East Passyunk for some of the best this city has to offer!"", ""The ice cream is amazing and very inexpensive. They have a drive thru for convenience and they have a wonderful staff!  Delicious!"", ""I'm not sure why I'm writing this since you can just look at every other review written for this place and get the exact same story.   My wife was literally grabbed, like actually literally grabbed, by the face the second she stepped in the door. The culprit was a big-tittied shot girl that proceeded to dump a bunch of piss water down her throat. Then I was informed I owed her $24. When I refused to pay I was told the police were being called. My wife, not wanting to spend our trip coming to pick me up at the police station, (which is where I gladly would have gone rather than give a penny to these shady-ass MFers), swiped my wallet from my pocket and paid the bill.   Everybody there from the door guys to the managers to the bathroom attendants are the worst, most sketchy people on Bourbon Street. If you gave this place a five-star review please do humanity a favor and shoot yourself in the face."", ""I'm from out of town and picked up an awful sinus infection. I neeeeeded hot and sour soup. I got broth with some vegetables and about 2 ounces of corse ground pepper. It was awful. I ordered for my son and husband and their food was awful. The crab Rangoon was burnt.  Three entrees, 1 pint hot and sour soup and one order crab Rangoon. It was almost 60 bucks for tiny boxes of food."", ""I had the spicy sashimi bowl here and it was absolutely amazing. This restaurant is a Korean owned sushi restaurant and their food is really good. The spicy sashimi bowl is an authentic Korean dish made to perfection.   I discovered this place yesterday and I'm already back today for more!   Ignore all of the bad reviews. This place is good."", ""This is the worst delivery experience I've ever had. I was a delivery driver for another Domino's for 5 years during college, so I know that things can get hectic, but this was ridiculous. Ordered online at 11:00pm, tracker said it would be delivered in 25-35 minutes. At 12:00am, the pizza had still not arrived so I called the store. They said mine was the next one out the door and should be there in a few minutes, because I live about 1 mile away from the store. At 1:00am, still no pizza. I call again and they said the driver left with my order and another order 30 minutes ago, and instead of driving to my house first, which was 1 MILE AWAY, he went to the other house first which was further away, and gave them their pizza AND MY PIZZA. They offered to make a new one and send it out, but I didn't want to wait up until 3 in the morning, so I said no thanks. They offered a free pizza on my next order, but that doesn't do anything to help me right now because it too late to order from anywhere else. This is why Uber Eats and other forms of food delivery will end up crushing stores like this. So to whoever runs this store, seriously, congratulations. You've just won the award for worst store in the franchise."", ""I'm not sure what happened here, but this place went downhill fast. I just had a pizza steak and chicken parm sandwich that were a step above edible. Seriously, I'm still trying to get the taste of the pizza steak out of my mouth. The only thing worse than being excited for a steak sandwich and having it suck is being excited for wings and having them forget to send the damn blue cheese!! Really?? Come on! I can honestly say that based On this experience, I would never go back.   First review: Great food and friendly service. We had an Italian hoagie, and cheesesteak hoagie, and hot wings. All we're fantastic. The rolls are soft and fresh. They were full of delicious meat. The wings were large and the hot sauce is the best I've had in the area. I'll be back for sure."", ""This is a great way to spend some time in New Orleans.  The swamp we went to was really beautiful and there was so much wildlife.  I had friends from out of town who had never been here before - they  were blown away!  We saw alligators, wild pigs, raccoons, turtles, snakes and lots of moving water (not sure what was down there).  The Captain was wonderful - he know everything about the area and answered everyone's questions completely.  He really made the tour not only a lot of fun but very educational.  He had everyone on board's attention, from 2 yrs old to 75+!  Will definitely put this on my list of things to do when I have company.  We'll be back!"", ""Place is top notch for the area - and so is the pricing.  If you want classy then you can't go wrong here.  Been a few times and always had a good meal.  I can't say much that put its in a different class then the other local stake houses though.  One thing to note is their 'happy hours'.  I've had several meetings at the bar during that time (5:00 to 6:30?) where the drinks are $6 and so are their 'Bar Bites' menu.  They have mini crab cake, burger and stake sandwiches - three of each for $6.  The burger and stake sandwiches are rib-eye I believe and really good.  They also have $2 oysters.  All in all - You can get a $195 shot of Lewi and a $175 porterhouse or a decent $6 sandwich and all with the same great service.  **Please do the rest of us a favor and don't bring your kids here.  Thank you!**"", ""This was my first experience not only being in a martini bar, but also a first martini. I was surprised at how many different ones there were to choose from,  I was always under the impression that Martini's were bland social sipping drinks, boy was I proved wrong with this excursion.  My choice of a Martini (yes I only had one) was called Caramel Apple, it had vodka and apple sour schnapps, and a caramel rim on the glass. omg was it delicious!  I sampled tastes of friends choices,  there was a mango strawberry one, one called  a Sassy Apple, a BB in drag (bugs bunny) Bitch & Mona, and one really delicious one called Stacy's Tea which I believe I will be having one of those the next time I return to this fin establishment.  The Bar has been around for quite a while, however the previous owners earned it a bad reputation for a short while before it was closed and reopened. since then all I have heard about it rave reviews, and after spending a couple of hours there I am now convinced I too am a fan!  The bartenders were super nice, and the wait times on the drinks was minimal even considering the large crowd that was in attendance. don't worry, if your not a martini fan there are other delicious concoctions available, and they also have a full regular bar with soda beer and liquor, but really, why would you have an ordinary drink when you can have something fantastic... Do yourself a favor and check out Absolutli Goosed you will be so glad you did.."", ""This was by far my favorite Cuban sandwich of all the Cubans I've had to date. We were treated to a free coffee after the meal as well as a spin of the wheel which led to a free dessert. Over all the experience was excellent.  I can't wait to go there again."", ""My group really enjoyed our Culinary History tour with Bob. He was entertaining, honest, and gave us some really great pointers about where to go in the city. I was pleased with the great balance of delicious food and interesting trivia we were served on the tour. I would highly recommend it!"", ""I am really impressed with the service here.  They have saved me thousands in repair costs on my first visit.  My second visit for a different problem resulted in a great permanent wiring repair.  My last visit was last minute on my part, but the staff was understanding and provided another great fix...They have my loyalty."", ""I went here last week for a special occasion dinner with family and we had a wonderful experience!   We had cocktails to start off; my key lime mojito was absolutely wonderful!  Loads of fresh lime and mint and just sweet enough!     Do not miss the starters here!  We had the shrimp corn dogs, bacon wrapped apricots and duck confit almonds.   The shrimp corn dogs are so good, and at only $2 each a really amazing deal!  The bacon wrapped apricots are an absolute must if you like the sweet-salty combo, and the almonds, which are roasted in duck fat, are absolutely delicious!    My entree featured trout and a variety of delicious accompaniments including bacon spaetzle.  Everything is presented beautifully; do not expect that an entree will stuff you here or that the accompaniments are full \""\""side\""\"" portions.  The flavors of everything together on the plate are just amazing and this trout entree was no exception!  We did get a side of the fried brussel sprouts which are not to be missed!!    The desserts are all deconstructed, and again, the presentation is beautiful!   I had a smores dessert that included chocolate ganache, toasted marshmallow ice cream and graham cake squares.    Service was excellent; attentive without being intrusive.  Courses were timed beautifully; we did not feel we were being rushed through, but also never felt we were left waiting.     This is definitely a special occasion type place, but for such events, well worth the price!"", ""(This review was attached to the previous address and name a few months after they opened at TV and Cat Highway; I have moved it here, though another form of the name is on the map too?) anyway ... We tried to dine here. I called ahead to ask some questions about the menu and some allergies we work with in our family (because I know that stopping the flow of a dinner service to ask the chef and/or manager questions isn't cool.) So I got the manager on the phone and it's clear that she isn't trained in the school of customer service and food allergies. I get it. Allergies suck to have to accommodate--even if it's just to answer a question about ingredients (try living with it). But when it comes down to having a table full of vomit and/or an epi pen getting whipped out, \""\""Pretty sure...\""\"" just doesn't cut it. Apparently they get their bread/buns from Vero's and therefore in the mystical teleportation device that procures the bread, no ingredient list is a available. But that's okay because some of their employees have worked there for like 10 years and know a lot of ingredients and things. But just not for sure if the buns contain eggs. But I could call Vero's myself to check. *sigh* I tried helping educate this defensive manager about how to better serve a party with food allergies (step 1: don't tell them to call a vendor to check your own product), but what's the point? They clearly didn't want our business anyway."", ""Salsa is absolutely terrible. Chips are great, but man that salsa lacks any and all flavor. No salt in it, no spice, no heat. The sweet potato and pork nachos were okay. It seems like a place that's overpriced and terrible because it can be due to its location. Up your salsa game.    ******************UPDATE***********************  So I went into their location on oak street after a fun night out with my buddy and I told him \""\""let's just go see if their salsa is any different than the other location. Plus, it was Endymion that night, so who knows. Everyone deserves a second chance.\""\""  We sit down at the bar and my buddy goes to use the restroom. Bartender asks me if we're eating, drinking, or a little of both. I told him about my previous salsa experience and he nodded. Thinking nothing of it, I go to use the restroom after my bro comes out and upon my return I have the general manager, the owner (I think?), and a chef all gathered around me to have me try their new salsa! Apparently they recognized me from my yelp profile picture, and wanted to leave a better impression. Well they most certainly did. They did something that I'm not accustomed to seeing in restaurants: they cared.   To veer off into a tiny tangent for a second, of all the restaurants I go to, good food is usually just a percentage or part of the overall experience. You won't go into an Applebee's or Chili's expecting to be taken care of. You go in there, you lock eyes with your waiter's tired eyes, you know everything is nuked in the microwave, you order it anyways, you eat, you pay, you tip, you leave. Don't expect anything magical from Applebee's or Chili's. They don't care. It's a mechanical process that's specialized by corporate heads in nicer places to delude you into thinking you're getting great service, or at least are entitled to, but you're not. You know that. But that's now why you go there. But that's the difference between those chain restaurants and restaurants that care. So to bring my tangent back to my main point, La Casita definitely left a lasting impression on me by showing how much they care. And that's what you want in a restaurant.   They changed their salsa and I got to try it. Now to be honest, fair, and balanced I didn't like their new salsa either. But if you're going based off of flavor, it was a thousand times better than what I experienced previously. I've worked at a Mexican restaurant where they made their salsa in house, and my tastebuds can't speak for everyone as everyone has specific things they like and dislike. I just happen to like salsa with a bit more heat, tang, and pop. But their salsa is definitely unique and improved.  Have not had an opportune chance to sit down and dine there yet, but will as soon as I can find some time! If you're in the mood for \""\""Tex mex meets Southern California with an authentic Mexican twist\""\"" as the bartender described it, then definitely head down there and be greeted by people who want you to enjoy your experience not because they're getting paid to but, rather more importantly, because they care."", ""In reality this is some of the best food I have ever had.  I have had Mylassian before, and we frequent Penang which is also Great, but this place is way better. Just off of 5th and South. South Street is also making a comeback with many great eclectic restaurants and Shops. I have to give this place to thumbs up.  The best kept secret in Philly."", ""Outstanding all around. Fresh salsa and great service for our party of 9.

The service was inattentive, the cheeseburgers were cooked on the surface of the sun (evidently, based on how charred they were), and there was a large roach that crawled across our table after we were served our food.

My husband, quite the connoisseur of steak here in the gulch- having eaten at Watermark, Adeles and Sambucca- has declared this steak: \""\""Best in the Gulch!\""\""   He asked that I quote him in this review, so here goes \""\""It's my 'perfect' but 'perfect' is relative. To be more descriptive it's cooked true to order, excellent flavor, very tender and much better than your average filet.\""\""   I am so very glad I gave them a second chance.

This is a \""\""must try\""\"" for all gulch residents and all who visit.        am"", ""I visited this yummy place last weekend and still can't get the food off my mind, so I thought it was necessary to share my love of PP's food!!

I ordered the Grill Cook's Medley and it was DIVINE!! The potatoes were fried up nice and crisp with a little bit of soft potato layered within the crust and covered in grilled veggies and meat.

It had a delicious rosa cream sauce that packed the perfect amount of heat and shrimp that were cooked just right. No matter when we go we always order the fried mozzarella appetizer.

First, it has a Starbucks inside so that's basically like +1000 points right there. Plus it's right when you walk in so you can grab something before you start your shopping.  Second, it's a super Target. Apparently those are somewhat of a rarity down here? By my old apartment in Goodlettsville, it's just a standard store with limited grocery options and whatnot. But this location has the full shopping experience. Plus the store brands that they have are always reasonably priced (generally on par or slightly lower than Kroger) and there is a fairly large variety. I always like going to this Target for food items because they seem to have a lot of the more obscure things I'm looking for. I'm looking at you Caramel Apple Oreos and Pumpkin Pie Poptarts!  Plus everyone is super helpful (if you need it anyway) and I've never had a problem with the speed of checkout or anything of the sort.

I still appreciate their food though, on a busy day when you want something wholesome it's one of the only places to run in and out, well near my work anyway. I have to say their breakfast bar on Saturdays and (I think also on Sundays) pretty much blows the one at Whole Foods out of the water.

First off, the modern decor inside the historical building makes for lots of easy conversation. There are some really cool, old city planning maps and trendy butcher block table tops. I loved everything about it!   I also loved that when I sat down, some very delicious cornbread fritters were delivered.

I would go back exclusively for the dip! It was served with fresh pita and was a great appetizer.   I couldn't decide what to order for dinner, but landed on the shrimp tacos and was happy with my decision! The corn tortillas were very crispy, almost tostada like and the spicy slaw and cojita was perfect! I would definitely order them again.

I just can't get over the fact that it fit so nicely and it was the only one I tried on.  The staff working here were very personable and helpful.  Did I mention it was clean?

The planning process wasn't a grueling experience at all.  With 10 additional men in the wedding spanning 3 different states, it was extremely convenient for everybody to handle their tux at whatever location was most convenient for them.  Having any one of the other 10 tuxes be compromised in any way (wrong fit, dirty, damaged, missing pieces, etc.) would be an inconvenience and obviously not ideal for a wedding that you pay huge bucks for everything to be perfect.  During the 2 months leading up to the wedding all 11 men went in and got fitted on time with only a few of them needing alterations or different sizes, my husband's being one of them (just one piece of the tux was wrong).  The rest of the guys picked theirs up with no problem, which left them to screw up the one tux that actually mattered most.  When my husband went in the day before the wedding to pick up his tux they couldn't give it to him because they didn't have it.  With only one piece of the tux needing to be replaced earlier in the week, they somehow managed to lose or send out the whole tux.  My husband mentioned that they weren't even very apologetic about it, just that that was that and they'd overnight the tux so that it was to them by the morning.    Our wedding was a couple hours away so my husband had to miss out on a couple things with some of our family and friends because he had to wait at home to pick up his tux the morning of our wedding and then drive all the way to the where our wedding in time for the photographer, etc.    Fast forward a couple weeks and we get a card in the mail \""\""Congratulations on your wedding.  I personally would like to thank you for choosing Men's Wearhouse for your special day.  From all of us here, good luck and congratulations!\""\"" - \""\""Jason\""\"".  I instantly take notice to 2 very obvious things....  1-) Where's the apology? And 2-) The 12 year old chicken scratch that wrote the card was not Jason, the person who signed it.  Different print, different color ink.  \""\""I PERSONALLY would like to thank you....\""\"" ....not so personal anymore is it?  Somewhat of a slap in the face that they didn't somehow take note to their screw up and at least follow up with us via a phone call to make sure everything went well and to offer an apology.  Also a slap in the face that Jason Hartley, an \""\""Operations Manager\""\"", couldn't even write a card himself, given the circumstances.    To say I'm annoyed by this, would be an understatement.  I WILL say, however, that Jason is lucky my husband didn't tell me about all of this until after the tux was in hand and en route to the wedding (and on time) the morning of our wedding because otherwise, he wouldn't have gotten off so easily."", ""Amazing food and cheap!

BAD BAD BAD"", ""Being a female I've never had to deal with tux shops until I/we started planning our wedding but you always hear the 'horror' stories of tuxes not fitting, pieces missing, pieces being dirty, stained, or damaged, somebody being charged for something, etc., so I was hoping we were one of the lucky ones that came out on the other side unscathed.    The planning process wasn't a grueling experience at all.  With 10 additional men in the wedding spanning 3 different states, it was extremely convenient for everybody to handle their tux at whatever location was most convenient for them.  Having any one of the other 10 tuxes be compromised in any way (wrong fit, dirty, damaged, missing pieces, etc.) would be an inconvenience and obviously not ideal for a wedding that you pay huge bucks for everything to be perfect.  During the 2 months leading up to the wedding all 11 men went in and got fitted on time with only a few of them needing alterations or different sizes, my husband's being one of them (just one piece of the tux was wrong).  The rest of the guys picked theirs up with no problem, which left them to screw up the one tux that actually mattered most.  When my husband went in the day before the wedding to pick up his tux they couldn't give it to him because they didn't have it.  With only one piece of the tux needing to be replaced earlier in the week, they somehow managed to lose or send out the whole tux.  My husband mentioned that they weren't even very apologetic about it, just that that was that and they'd overnight the tux so that it was to them by the morning.    Our wedding was a couple hours away so my husband had to miss out on a couple things with some of our family and friends because he had to wait at home to pick up his tux the morning of our wedding and then drive all the way to the where our wedding in time for the photographer, etc.    Fast forward a couple weeks and we get a card in the mail \""\""Congratulations on your wedding.  I personally would like to thank you for choosing Men's Wearhouse for your special day.  From all of us here, good luck and congratulations!\""\"" - \""\""Jason\""\"".  I instantly take notice to 2 very obvious things....  1-) Where's the apology? And 2-) The 12 year old chicken scratch that wrote the card was not Jason, the person who signed it.  Different print, different color ink.  \""\""I PERSONALLY would like to thank you....\""\"" ....not so personal anymore is it?  Somewhat of a slap in the face that they didn't somehow take note to their screw up and at least follow up with us via a phone call to make sure everything went well and to offer an apology.  Also a slap in the face that Jason Hartley, an \""\""Operations Manager\""\"", couldn't even write a card himself, given the circumstances.    To say I'm annoyed by this, would be an understatement.  I WILL say, however, that Jason is lucky my husband didn't tell me about all of this until after the tux was in hand and en route to the wedding (and on time) the morning of our wedding because otherwise, he wouldn't have gotten off so easily."", ""Food is expensive and not worth it. My hubby had carnitas - very dry. I had the scallops- expensive and undercooked. Not even a browned crust. Rice was served \""\""family style \""\"" but do mushy and overlooked.

Mine was supposed to be a standard cream cheese topping but it didn't taste like there was any cream cheese in it.  Maybe they gave me the wrong topping because it tastes like coconut. My sister got maple flavored which she did not like.  The 6 year old ate her cotton candy frosting but we did not like it.  To say the least, we scraped off all the toppings and still didn't eat all of the rolls. Perhaps this was a fluke but I seriously doubt we will come back to find out. Sorry.

We got 2 brisket tacos and the daily feature, fried green tomatoes. The food took awhile to get to us, but when it did... holy crap. It was SO GOOD! The tacos were amazing, stuffed full of juicy shredded brisket, pico de gallo, beans, fried jalapenos... maybe more stuff but they were so flavorful and amazing I could barely stand it. And the fried green tomatoes were delicious as well! It ended up being way more food than we wanted for a small snack but we ate every single bite. Well worth it!

I'd like to follow up on Elsa H.'s review of this place, since I was a member of the family being threatened with police action over trying to purchase a lamp.  I've visited this store many times (it's only a few blocks from our house--we live in the Garden District / Irish Channel), and have had no small share of weird or rude encounters.  Previously, it was decidedly unfriendly looks from the staff, noting encounters with patrons who wanted to keep their purses rather than surrender them at the front counter, etc.  I continued to visit, however, because there's a certain sort of eclectic \""\""junk pile\""\"" vibe here and some genuinely interesting stuff. This time, the epic unfriendliness of the staff was directed squarely at us, however.  One detail omitted from the previous description of this encounter is when Elsa tried to diffuse the situation with the female owner, the husband (?), rather than trying to also diffuse the situation and (perhaps?) sell something, immediately not only made the \""\""tell the police to hurry up\""\"" remark  but also tried to throw additional and unrelated fuel on the fire, and blame the kids for breaking things.  Since they were picking vintage comic books for purchase with me, in a different area of the store, and the lamp was on a high shelf elsewhere, that's a little hard to digest.  I'd also like to reinforce how nice it was to have other patrons who were also going to buy things simply leave the store and follow us next door to La Davina (highly recommended gelato) to discuss what happened.  If you're visiting New Orleans and looking for antiques, I strongly encourage you to check out the other offerings on Magazine St.  If you're a local, I think it's obvious that except possibly as an anti-gentrification move, we really don't want a visitor's experience on the otherwise fantastic Magazine St. stretch to include this sort of abuse.  And finally, if you're considering consigning your merchandise to be sold by this store, I encourage you to first be an observant \""\""customer\""\"", and decide if you believe anything will actually be sold at all, given the attitude of the owners.  There are better choices.   Please don't support this horrible store.

My pedicures take about an hour on average which I like. I've been to salons in the past that rush you so much and take a total of 20 minutes. The owner ensures that this is a relaxing experience for each customer. They also give a hot stone massage on your back as you wait for your nails to dry. In addition they have a rewards card  that is marked for each service. I have finally found my nail salon!"", ""Love this place! Furniture is very high quality and American made.

We were on our way back home from a long afternoon walking tour of Longwood Gardens and decided to try a good old fashioned neighborhood crawl for one of those little Italian neighborhood restaurant gems for which South Philly is so well known. Tre Scalini came up number 1 on Yelp! based on our then current location and, despite that it was in a more commercially developed location than we were looking for (there were 3 othere restaurants in the same small block) I am extrememly glad we decided to go in anyway!  We had no reservation and were dressed rather casually, and despite the fact that it was Saturday night and they were very busy and pretty booked up, the ma\u00eetre d' was able to work us in with absolutely no waiting. Kudos to his efforts!  Since others here have already reviewed the menu offerings, all I'm going to add is (dare I say?) if you're in the mood and it looks good on the menu, it will be.   The atmosphere is Elegant South Philadelphia Italian, cozy, and warm. Our servers  treated us like royalty, and were extremely attentive despite the fact that we were still in our rather natty sneakers. Each knew the menu and dinner specials inside out, no small task, I can assure you.  Parking is tough in town, and if you just can't bring yourself to pay for the valet parking (it's only 8 bucks, for Pete's sake!), stick it out and don't stop searching until you find a spot - it's well worth the time and effort. And make sure you pay any parking fees - thePPA NEVER takes a break from writing tickets in this city because such a large amount of revenue is generated from the restaurant districts.  I can't recommend Tre Scalini enough -- we couldn't have asked for a better meal or dining experience.

The ambience is magnificent with the dreamy oaks trees lined up on City Park for an outside view. The service is always five star.  But the food, the reason for going in the first place is what should and does stand out. Here the food is truly memorable. The short ribs appetizer alone is worth going back for again and again. Oh and the chocolate doberge cake is perfection. They have delicious special drinks each month that proceed a charity, giving you a reason to drink if you ever needed one. Ralph's is definitely a special place."", ""After being concerned about a recent service - I was impressed that Plymouth Auto was accountable for their work and made good on what might otherwise have been a not great situation."", ""Excellent store with great selection and very knowledgeable sales people.

Place gets crowded. Best burger in stl in my opinion. Share some sides, you won't be mad."", ""Do not stay here!    We had a very bad experience with this hotel.  Let me start by saying that we reserved a room for our wedding night.  The next morning we had a very early flight to Montego Bay so we checked out of our room around 5:30 a.m. the next morning.  We actually had no complaints until we tried to use our debit card on a large purchase in Jamaica on our honeymoon and it was denied.  OK, this special time that only happens once in your life.... was completely ruined because this hotel charged our account 3 TIMES for the room amount at a whopping $240 a pop. We only left a small amount in our checking account because we were travelling out of country (just in case something happened and someone got our card number or something).  After getting charged $19.99 per MB to check our bank account using data on my cell phone, we discovered this MESS that Courtyard put us in.    We had planned on a couple's massage by the beach in Jamaica but that couldn't happen!  Plans on our honeymoon were ruined and I am still very upset!!!  After getting back into the states on a Saturday evening, I called the hotel to try and figure out what as going on.  I was told that a manager would have to speak with me and she would not be in until Tuesday.  I was forwarded to her voicemail and left a message.  The manager finally got back with me and she stated that she had no idea what was going on.  I explained to her my process through booking: I am a Marriott Rewards Member so I just logged into my account and booked a room.  After realizing that I would not be about to check into the room at check in since our wedding was at 4pm I called the hotel and added my husband to the account so that he could check into the room.  I also asked about how much the deposit for the room would be since Marriott usually charges a deposit in case of any charges.  The lady told me that it varies per hotel and I told her that I needed to know (since we were only transferring a certain amount into our checking).  She called the hotel and then finally got back on the line with me... she said that the deposit would not be more than $50.  When he went to check in he told them he wasn't sure what name the reservation was under it could have been either one of our last names. They found the reservation and got him checked in.  We checked out at 5:30 a.m. the next morning and that was all we knew.  The manager had then figured out what had happened: They created a new reservation for my husband and then charged me for a NO SHOW on my reservation.  The third charge was the pre-authorization that showed $220!  Let me re-cap:  They charged me 2 TIMES FOR THE ROOM and screwed up the check in.  THEN... they neglected to let us know that the pre-authorization and the room cost would be charged in the same amount on the same day of check in!  They also charged us for parking!  We had already parked our car in a parking garage and did not park with them!   The manager acted as if it was my husbands fault for creating a new reservation.   I assured her that he absolutely knew that we had a reservation and wouldn't have created a new reservation that it must have been her staff that messed up!    She credited my account for the no-show, told me that the pre-authorization takes 7 business days to fall off of the account, and then credited me for the parking.  She did credit back all fraudulent charges to our account!  However, she can never replace what we lost on our honeymoon all because of their screw ups and neglect in informing us about the pre-authorization and room charge on the same day!  (Basically it showed up twice in one day right after another... which makes no sense... usually a pre-authorization is charged to hold the money and then the balance is updated... like when you leave a tip at a restaurant... not two separate charges!).

It was difficult to read the menu. The menu did not say one could purchase an individual piece of chicken. The lady behind the counter was as slow as molasses in the wintertime.  When we finely stepped up to the counter the employee was unable to address my questions about the menu. Her speech was inaudible.  I asked if she spoke english, I'm pretty sure she did, but not very well. My wife and I walked out without ordering.  We will not be back."", ""Okay I JUST got here and am extremely unimpressed. As I type this I'm sitting in the lobby waiting for our room to be cleaned because it wasn't ready for check in time. Our check in time was 3 o'clock (which is already late as it is), and when we got to our room, the place was AN ABSOLUTE MESS. The bedsheets and pillows were thrown on the floor, there were beach towels (not belonging to the hotel) lying around, and KFC food on the table. It was as if someone had just left.  Aside from that, the people at the front desk could really care less. When we went up to go talk to them, they didn't even apologize. All they said was to wait HALF AN HOUR for the room to be cleaned. AND they offered us another room... A smaller one. For the same ridiculously priced rate.  Primarily upset with the lack of hospitality, not so much for the clean room. People make mistakes, which is understandable. But the way they handled the situation was terrible and I'm definitely not coming back here.  **update it's been over thirty minutes and I'm still waiting for a room."", ""Texas Roadhouse does not give you the steak you ask for in the case. I have been here multiple times, asked for a specific steak, and have a steak come out for my meal that is a completely different steak.

We really appreciated that our food was made after we ordered it, rather than being prepared hours before.  Joey brought us coffee and--my test of an attentive server--keep our coffee and water filled up.  When we were low on coffee, instead of warming up our coffee, he brought new cups.  This was typical of the excellent service.      The food was superb.  I had a medium-rare steak; it was actually cooked medium-rare, which does not always happen.  The flavor of all our entrees and side orders was very tasty.      We plan to go back frequently.  Heartily recommended.  The wait is noted in other reviews, and it's because of the quality of food.

Even more impressive? I had a two month build up prior to finally eating from here and it wasn't anti climatic.  First, this place is local to me. It's located in the Tower Grove South neighborhood in a nondescript building. They have free wifi and ample plugins for electronics... Which would have been handy had I ate in as my Macbook's battery is exhausted these days.  If you can't bring yourself over there or feel comfy in your PJs, no fear! There is delivery available through the bike waiter for $2.99 (or through Eat24 - who uses the bike waiter, but offers a weekend coupon)  They offer breakfast and lunch, but all I have had is breakfast. What have I had?  French Toast sticks... I feel like I was told there would only be three pieces, but I got four... Not those wimpy French today sticks from the freezer aisle, but actually French toast cut into strips. They come with the best syrup ever.   Triple Quasar burrito. I uploaded a pic of this and it really was huge. Huge doesn't always translate into tasty with burritos, but this one was great. I am not sure if I like this as much as the one from tortilla grille, but they're totally different so it's hard to compare... This one was less separate components, more blended together - which is good for consistent taste, but makes it harder to pick out individual flavors.   Definitely will be back."", ""I finally got to try them. Wow..they did a great job with the remodle.

It is located in a new strip mall just off highway 64's Green Mount  Rd. exit in O'Fallon, IL (less than a half hour drive from St. Louis).  It is nicely decorated, simple, earthy, and contemporary.  They have a few Chinese items on the menu, but it is primarily Thai.  I had the pleasure of doing a curry taste test at a recent Thai festival in Florrisant and Sala Thai was the best by far.  It is good to know their cook is carrying on the good cooking at a newer & nicer location!    Today, we sampled the tofu yellow curry, pad Thai, Thai sweet & sour shrimp, & Thai cashew chicken.  The Thai version of these dishes has more complex flavor combinations and is lighter and more delicious than simlar dishes from some of their Asian counterparts.  I loved it all!  Vegetarians will like Aroy, as well.  They have a large selection of interesting and tasty vegetarian items.  The food service is a wee bit slow and the items are priced a little high, but it is absolutely yummy!  My only real complaint is that it is small and they get packed early.  So give yourself some time.  It still amazes me that the four best Thai restaurants in the region are in the Metro East.

Most of them seem to be layer cakes in various flavor combinations (though they do have other pastries). All the cakes I've tried have been very good.

However, for my birthday, I had their Boston Cream (Creme?) cake, which was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend also got me a custom cake that's more European in style. They did an amazing job, and it says a lot that they were willing to try something new (I don't believe they'd made it before). The shop itself is very cute - definitely \""\""new Fishtown\""\"" but still manages to be charming. The staff has always been friendly and willing to describe their goodies.

Great cheese selection fair prices 1 ounce portions for each cheese. We all went for the three course prefix $40. The mushroom bruschetta and the beef cheeks focaccia  were both delicious.

The hotel is centrally located, has a great bar/lounge with live music and is connected to Desire restaurant which is very solid. If your room is on Bourbon, it can be pretty loud but with enough libations, falling asleep was never an issue. I don't know about all of the staff but those I interracted with most (bartenders and night security) were awesome. Came back to the hotel one night and Trombone Shorty was tearing up the lounge - unbelievable to walk into the middle of that. Pool area looked nice but never swam.

The guy at the counter asked if I wanted, to which I replied \""\""As long as the best tires are up front.\""\"" So they did. I drove home and noticed my tires were noisier than usual, but didn't notice until I got on faster roads how bad they were. They had rotated, but the tires up front were not the better tires. They were closed, and were not open Sunday so I went to another shop open on Sundays. He took about 3 seconds to look at my tires and told me not only were they two different tires (not Midas fault, but I had never looked closely) but one was directional and on incorrectly, while the other had some really strange wear. He wasn't sure why they had put these on front, but cost me $22 to rotate them back so the good tires were back on front.  I emailed corporate, letting them know my dissatisfaction. I got an email back from Nate Heichelbech and he said he could fix my rotation and give me a coupon for an oil change. I explained that I had gone to someone else since I drive 60+ miles a day to work and couldn't wait. Further, an oil change coupon didn't take care of $22 repair. I simply wanted a refund for $22 and an apology since it was clear not a single technician looked at my tires before rotating. (Which I understand is part of their job) He said he could not refund a free service. I went on to say that was fine - refund the $60 synthetic oil change instead.    He then said he has documentation from the store manager that I insisted on the tire rotation even though they highly advised against it. Not a single person told me anything about my tires, nor was it indicated on any courtesy check or on my invoice. The manager was flat out lying. I offered to PDF him my documents.  All I wanted was $22 and an apology from Midas about a crappy job. In the last few visits I've seen a decline in the service and quality of work. What makes this worse is the resolution was simple.

I noticed the prices on the menu, but wasn't adding up my bill ahead of time or anything because that's, you know, the restaurant's job. So I didn't blink when a check totaling $22.51 came, and I didn't pay any mind about tipping %20 (despite the faults, I've been a server before, so I can understand). In the end I paid $28. It was after we were long gone that I realized the total Should have been closer to $16, not $22.51. Did I get the wrong check and not notice? Did they add gratuity to a teeny little party of two without even telling me? Either way, that's a big no-no, right?  I wasn't being on my toes I guess, but I still feel a little ripped off. Ultimately they received more money than I personally thought the whole experience was worth, hence my poor star rating.

The good first: the service was friendfly and efficient.      The bad: poor quality chips, including some tasting of rancid oil, were accompanied with pretty good salsa and truly tasteless queso. Seriously, the jar of queso in the grocey is eons better.      My lenten crawfish quesedillas were okay, but nothing to write home about and they were probably the tastiest thing to hit our table.      My lovely wife had the not at all lovely (to look at...an amalgam of beiges & light browns in amoebic puddles) Rio Grande plate. Bear in mind, Paige is pretty down with standard American-style mexican if it is fresh, but she was pretty underwhelmed.

Nicole is an outstanding service manager. From the start Nicole has been a professional and listens to the customer. I was impressed when Markatos did an initial in-person quote. I had called a few other firms and was shocked to get a huge estimate over the phone based on square footage. My husband and I are the only occupants so the spare rooms and bathrooms are hardly used. Markatos takes that into account and that will definitely save you money.  Markatos sticks to a schedule pretty well. For routine service,once assigned a date/time the team never cancels or shifts days. On occasion, hours may shift but it is not a big deal.   Great with pets! My dogs are treated exceptionally well and let out of crates while they are there. The dog are put back in the crate afterward. Markatos does a great job removing pet hair....amazing.  The office management is exceptionally hardworking and accomodating. If I had to change or cancel a service they are top notch....Jo Ann thanks!  Trustworthy .Period. We have never had a problem with things missing or stolen. Often leave them unattended and its never a problem.   Recently, I noticed a few items were not cleaned as well as I am used to.  I let Nicole know and the next day she had a schedule in place to re-clean FREE of charge! She also took it as opportunity to re-train the team. The house looks amazing.

Cashiers have an attitude and the pharmacy is never prepared. When going through the drive through to pick up prescriptions, you will have to wait at least 15 minutes for someone to even address you and then another half an hour to pick up your prescriptions.

The applesauce was so sweet to be inedible.    I asked for rolls (which weren't brought with our meals) so I'd have a little more food to make up for that I didn't eat the rice pilaf or the applesauce and half my salad was the \""\""non-food\""\"" part of the lettuce.

The woman who did my nails became upset very quickly and attempted to grab my hand and force me to let her re-do her first job.

The bloomin onion was not the onion the restaurant usually uses because it was on the spicy side. The chesse fires when on the ok side since they did not put much chesse or bacon on the appetizer. So in all reality we ordered a plate of fires with a little chesse and bacon. My grandmother ordered the 6oz steak and it was also on the spicy side. I however ordered the same thing but I ordered mine medium rare but when I got my steak it was rare instead of medium rare and also was really spicy.

She checked my name in and told me to sit down, then walked away before I could ask where the waiting area was.   The wax was the worst wax I've ever had - and I've been waxing for years. Erica didn't double-dip the sticks, but used the paper strips over and over, which I found unsettling. The conversation was fine, she was pleasant enough but did a terrible job. This next part is a bit ahem, graphic, so first-time waxers beware...   Compared to other aestheticians that take their time and position your legs in various positions to get the best possible view and angle for waxing, she simply had me open one leg at a time and waxed the entire area like that. This was much more painful, as each area was not pulled taut when she waxed, and resulted in an unsightly (not to mention painful) bruise in my nether regions. The rest of the area was red for hours longer than it usually is.  Then, when I went to pay, the girls behind the desk were *again* on the phone/talking/too busy to talk to me. After a while, I finally got someone's attention, but while I was her asking a question, the phone rang. Without so much as asking me to hold on, she answered it, began talking, and walked away. I signed my credit card receipt and stood there awkwardly, alone, wondering if I was finished. Finally, when they noticed me, I asked if I was done. The woman said yes and just waved me away.   I escorted myself out, feeling dismissed and completely unimportant.

While there was one server who was friendly (taller blond with a braided ponytail), the rest of the staff were simply unhappy people.  The majority of the time we were there they moped around behind the counter like zombies where a TV was on with the news.  Smiles were met with grumpy faces, waves from a smiling 17 month old were met with a obvious turn the other way, questions were met with short and unpleasant answers - it was depressing to say the least.  To say it nicely, the staff all need some hugs- as someone previously mentioned about Carl (again except for the blond with braided ponytail, she was pleasant).

I wasn't sure what door to enter, didn't want to interrupt a mechanic in the middle of an Auto-pay. Turns out no cars or car fumes just good-friendly service & good food. I had the roast beef on rye with a beer can't remember the name of cause this was a while ago.   After some planning & rescheduling, I was able to introduce my brother to PJ's he liked it too.

At this time of year, I did not expect any great finds because many of the items for which I look have their annual release later in the year so it's a surprise to find any of them on the shelf. For example, Elmer T Lee is a favorite of mine so it was one that I asked about.  Despite the fact that I walked away without Elmer T, I still had a great time. I enjoyed a few tastes at the tasting bar and even better I had a great conversation with Max. He is one of the reasons I will return.  I did walk out with a bottle of Tennessee whiskey cream that is not sold locally and there was a bottle on the shelf that I have not seen locally that I need to investigate.

This little restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside, but it's very cute and quaint on the inside. Our server was polite and friendly. He kept the soda refills coming, and did a good job overall. However, this is where the praise ends.  I went to this restaurant because I was in the area and wanted some Italian food. I saw the four star average reviews and figured it would be tasty. Be warned. It is WAY overpriced, and the food wasn't even good. The mozzarella sticks looked and tasted like the frozen ones you buy at the grocery store. They were $7.99 for five small sticks. Not worth it. Then came the entrees. Everything on the menu had cute names and sounded delicious. My husband ordered Chicken Parm, and I had the Baked Ziti. It was awful. I mean... not good at all. His chicken was \""\""ok,\""\"" but not crispy on the outside like parm should be. Mine didn't have the brown, bubbly, cheesy top you'd normally see on baked ziti. The mozzarella cheese was barely even melted. The sauce tasted like it came from a jar. It was weak and not very flavorful. I had about five bites and didn't even take my leftovers home for the kids.   Save your money and go to Olive Garden instead. I like to support local businesses, but this was an unpleasant dining experience. Let me say again, it was ridiculously expensive and the food was just BAD. I seriously left there wishing I'd gone to McDonald's instead."", ""They are dirty, have very bad service, they are very distracted.

They have some beer flavors off the tap that I've never heard of before like \""\""Strawberry Shortcake Lager\""\"" (which was what I tried). It was good, smelled like strawberries but tasted nothing like them. I also had a taste of their pear cider (which you can also get off tap) and the flavor mixed with the fizz was actually really good. Not the kind where it sort of hurts your throat. And with the ciders you won't feel the alcohol so much too so you wouldn't really know if you're starting to get tipsy or not.

We still got a table but it was right up front near the door and it was very uncomfortable. We had trouble getting situated at our high table and his grandparents had an ever harder time. We ordered oysters and none of them were cut properly so we had to scrape them out with our forks before we could eat them. After our appetizers came my boyfriends grandfather had to use the restroom and when we came back he told us there wasn't any soap so he told one of the employees. He intended to go wash his hands when our meals came out so that they would have plenty of time to refill the soap. Our meals came and he went back in the bathroom and the soap still wasn't refilled. Luckily, we had our own bottle of hand sanitizer with us so he had to resort to using hand sanitizer before eating his meal. The worst part is that he ordered a lobster roll. So it wasn't like he was eating with silverware. He had to eat his birthday meal with his hands that he couldn't even get soap to wash. Our total bill was around $160 and I really do not think we should've had to pay $160 for a meal that we couldn't even wash our hands before we ate it. We will never go back to Docs.

This isn't Greek; it isn't even Mediterranean. It's pseudo-Americanized versions of Mediterranean classic cuisine. The corporate chefs got so many things wrong:  Skordalia is a classic Greek dip made out of potatoes and garlic (not bread).  Avgolemono is chicken soup with egg, lemon and rice -- not this thin, awful broth they are currently serving. If one wants true Greek cooking, one should go to Greektown in either Detroit or Toronto.

Pros: Lovely environment with pretty lights, numerous heating lamps, indoor seating area to get snacks and hot chocolate, pricing reasonable.   Cons: Rentals are hockey skates and not figure skates and weren't in the greatest of shape. Rink is pretty small for the amount of people they let on. Poorly tended ice - we got on right after they 'cleaned it up' and it was rough and choppy and the worst areas were the perimeter where inexperienced skaters would need smoother ice the most.

The lady told me it was made and sitting there. What the hell you leave a sandwich sitting there for an hour? Apparently they only have two drivers on today.

No one informed me that they were out of buns, but they could have at least tried to dress it up. It was seriously a lone piece of ground meat (to their credit, the manager did comp that meal).

Anyway, my order total came to $160 but I was still charged shipping at checkout. So I called cust svc and spoke to an idiot beyotch that was hostile and completely mathematically challenged and illogical, as her defense was that since I used a coupon on my order, I should be okay with paying the shipping fee. Huh?! When that excuse didn't work, she then said I wasn't charged shipping for the conditioner (I had 4  items on my order). Umm, that makes no sense, as I'm still paying shipping on the other items (that are packaged in the same box as the \""\""freely shipped\""\"" conditioner), plus the  shipping fee is a flate rate, so what good is it if one item out of 4 is shipped free?!

Appetizer was the only thing to make it out and was decent boneless wings. Even with the manager begging us to let her get our food together free and not walk out, the service was beyond dismal and slow. First and last time coming to a Beef's. Made us all late. If we had waited at our table for the food we would have made our year anniversary before it came out. Better choices for food elsewhere.

I tried the wedding cake, cinnamon sugar, and Nola Cream (not on the same day I swear).  The Nola cream has a slight hint of rum and reminded me of a Bushwacker for those of you familiar with the heavenly frozen-chocolatey-rum-concoction served near the Gulf Coast.   Service was nice & fast, atmosphere was great! NOW- to address the comments about these donuts being a strange consistency.  The donuts here (in my opinion) have an almost beignet texture and flavor.

We had the chicken, ribs and macaroni, and the Brie and crab hand pie. All of it was great, the meat was all tasty and tender. The macaroni was very cheesy and had a hint of black pepper.

Washers range from $3-$6.50 and dryers are $.25 or $.50 for 7-8 minutes (depends on size).   There are always staff around and they're nice and helpful.  I think they also offer washing/folding services - ask the front desk.   Parking is not usually an issue unless it's peak after work hours.

We decided to walk to have breakfast in Surrey, which we found on Yelp. It was a highly recommended local breakfast place. Located far from the touristy French quarters, it's a small shack-dive beloved by locals and tourists as the best in local cuisine. Even before we got there, we saw a crowd of people waiting outside. The wait for a table was 30 minutes so we felt lucky and elated to sit at the bar. We got a watermelon and jicama salad and a crabmeat omelet. I was disappointment from the first bite. The omelet was soooo rich, like it was made with cream and butter and more butter-cream on top; it made me nauseous. The salad was so plain, it felt like a joke, a few pieces of watermelon on ripped up leaves of bibb lettuce  covered with black pepper. I needed to eat something and asked for a garden salad with a poached egg. It was a poor showing with some mixed greens, a pathetically thin slice of tomato, a few cubes of huge cucumbers used for juicing and a balsamic vinaigrette mixed by finger right in front of me. The place is a tiny shack, should be filled with lovingly prepared local cuisine. It is NOT. The food, as well as the service and the ambiance are a poor showing, more hype than substance. The supposedly organic fresh juices, at $7 a pop, are not squeezed to order but poured from containers from the fridge. Freshly squeezed should be freshly squeezed. They refused to give us water with ice. How can you not give people water when its so unbearable hot outside? We paid more for our breakfast than a top French restaurant in New York and I walked away hungry and disgusted."", ""I love this chain! It's clean, quick, & inexpensive.

It's not often you hear  praise for auto shops, but this place really deserves its great reputation."", ""First time here recommended by my brother and talk about breakfast feast!!!!! Absolutely delicious!!!! Their all meat omelette was so huge, 3 people can share! The owner was so friendly and when he noticed that the pancakes are small in size he compliments with another piece! He recommends to try their variety of syrups. The coconut syrup was a bit too sweet and not so coconut flavor but was delicious, the tropical syrup was off the hook, but it tasted better with my ham!

Highly recommended, prices are equal to amount of food dished!"", ""We just had a fairly large contingent arrive for a wedding from France and Los Angeles. Everyone was welcomed by the hotel staff and had nothing but compliments and accolades for the staff and accommodations. The complimentary hot breakfast was a huge hit. Sheri Caja, Director of Sales, and her entire staff made our friends feel very welcome. The staff made sure everyone received their welcome bags and were on top of any requests we had for the group. I highly recommend blocking rooms for any event in the area.   It was a very busy weekend with the NFL draft hosted in Philadelphia and I had inquired at several hotels in the Mt. Laurel area with the Hampton Inn far exceeding our request for blocking.   Our guests gushed about the friendliness of the staff and the sparkling clean hotel.

Sam totally messed up the order. The spicy tuna ended up with my california rolls but i just dove in, unaware of the mixup. I cant even handle mild salsa so when i ate the tuna, it was so hot, i almost threw up, started crying and sweating- it was an awful experience. I tried to eat a california roll but my mouth hurt so bad, i couldn't taste anything and I totally lost my appetite. We didnt even bother trying to get sam to fix the order.

We had been ordering from them almost weekly since they opened and at first, their pizza was outstanding.  Plenty of toppings, spicy sauce, and a light crunchy crust.  Gradually, however, they declined in quality and quantity.  We quit ordering for many months.  Last weekend, we gave it another try, but it has gotten worse.  Very skimpy toppings and the crust was slightly underdone.  The pizzas in the box looked nothing like the pics on the box.

The reviews seemed okay and everyone said that the drinks were really good.   Not at all true....  To start with, we ordered the guacamole. I have had a lot of different kinds and make it myself at home, and this was incredibly bland with not a lot of flavor.  I ordered the Carnitas Tacos and my boyfriend got the Brisket Tacos (special of the day). They were all right, but the waiter told us right off the bat he would recommend a side since they were small portions.  We didn't end up eating any of our side since they were so big, we each only finished two tacos!   The most disappointing part of this whole experience was the drinks.  I got the Classic Mojito (which I have also had and made many times before) and he got the Mexican style Mojito, that apparently is with cilantro and tequilla instead of rum and mint.  The first batch were really delicious, so we ordered another round. Not at ALL the same drink.  They looked very different, but mainly they didn't taste at all similar.  Very very sweet and acidic, way too bitter.  We politely called the waiter over and asked if the bartender wouldn't mind remaking them since the first drinks we had were very different, and he obliged. A few seconds later the bartender came back and told us she remade the drinks but tasted them and they tasted exactly how they should be.  She was very condescending and rude (My boyfriend and I have both worked in customer service before...when customers are being polite in their complaints, there is no need to be rude back) and said she would make the drink for us 10 times if we wanted but it wouldn't be any different. She said that they first AMAZING drink we had must have been made wrong.  She kept asking us how they were different and we had trouble explaining to her exactly what to change, so we decided to let it go and asked for the check. Yes, we still got charged for the shitty drinks that we left on our table.   For a tequilla bar who is apparently known for their drinks, the inconsistency is frightening.  I was very disappointed in the entire experience, not what I was planning for the first birthday that my boyfriend and I spent together."", ""I love wine, but haven't been to many tasting houses.

It was a nice change from the over-the-top bars on Bourbon St."", ""They never shipped the item and its been 18 days. They don't answer their phone or email and after I leave a message, they don't call back. It seems like they are basically running a scam.  I would avoid dealing with them as they do not fulfill their orders or believe in any customer service."", ""Wow.  I have to say incredible.  We've driven by the place several times and always had that \""\""meh' attitude because of how the plaza looks.  Since the wife was craving some crispy duck it came up as having the best reviews for it.   Walking in, was a great traditional indian/thai setting with a comfortable small raunt demeanor.  We tried the mussel appetizer, while the wife got the Tamarind Duck and I tried the Panang Curry with calamari.   Service was prompt, quick and non invasive.  Mussels were tasty, but the Duck and Curry were to die for!  Portion sizes are definitely reflective of the prices so don't feel like you are going to get gyped.   We will be back to at least try the sushi or get more duck seeing as they have at least 2 more styles of it.   Happy tastebuds!"", ""I'm a Barbecue judge and this ain't barbecue.  Not in Texas, not in the southeast.  Not in KC.  An earlier reviewer nailed it perfectly.  The brisket is fatty pot roast.  No evidence of smoke.  Mushy texture like long braised  meat.  My sandwich was 75 percent fat.  Big meatless chunks of fat.  Either the owner doesn't care or he's left the place in the hands of employees who don't know any better. Sorry.  But you can do much better elsewhere."", ""First time here and definitely loved the food. The atmosphere and staff are great. So much food. I had leftovers for the next day!"", ""Our monthly tradition of grazing on Starters continues to be an amazing experience.  This time we didn't stop with our old standbys.   We ordered Mac n Cheese, Goat Cheese, Calamari, Crab Cake, and Egg Rolls.  What I love about this place is it's clear that nothing is pre-made because it arrives at our table looking fresh and alive.  Colors and aroma hit you the minute it lands on the table.  So popular with locals, the bar has 6 single diners chatting and feeling comfortable and clearly enjoying eating a meal they thought were eating alone. The overall feeling we get when we come here is - home.   Comfortable asking questions on menu and recommendations.  When paring wine with food, they are not shy in making alternative suggestions.   This alone makes us want to come back.  Service, in my opinion, is the key to forgiveness and LOYALTY.  The food has been consistent and a delight each time.   Tonight in particular if We had to pick a favorite - we can't.  We are arguing over each of our favorites and we can pick a winner among four adults.  So hats off to The Chef - we can't pick a single winner so the award must go to Slate - tonight YOU are our local favorite.   Keep up the amazing job!"", ""Whoa, I feel I must come to their defense. My daughter is 23 and they were her first and only dentists. I feel their dentistry is fine. I do remember that 18 years ago the receptionist told me I should change my name to match my daughter's name. (so they would know where to apply the check I sent in for payment - which they cashed anyway). Other than that, the care and service has always been good."", ""Me and my boyfriend stopped here traveling through Riverway and it was the best decision we made all weekend. We had the fried tofu as an appetizer and we both had the chicken pad Thai. The food was fresh, made from scratch and so tasty.

Hey - sounds like a bunch of good things rolled into one.  It was early, so we didn't have the sliders, but the donuts and coffee were exceptional.  The donuts looked overdone and loaded up with unnecessary ingredients at first, but I was wrong.  They were actually well balanced with good flavors.  They take coffee seriously too.  I tried their \""\""Cold Nitro Brew\""\"" which seemed more like a Guinness than an iced coffee.  It wasn't exactly my style (so switched it for a latte instead) but I applaud them for trying to innovate."", ""I'm giving my visit to Aveda Institute a 5 for a series of reasons, and the price is definitely a factor.  For $16, I was greeted promptly (promptly in my book at a salon is within 15 minutes of my appointment) by my student stylist, Miata. Miata is about the cutest sweetest thing north of Atlanta as far as I am concerned. She was talkative and had a lot of suggestions for what I could do with my hair.   She also listened to exactly what I wanted -- and delivered. I have fairly course hair (for a white girl) and I don't treat it with much, nor do I blow it dry (on my own it never works). She cut a little less than an inch off (my guesstimation), feathered in fantastic layers, and then blew out my hair.    I am extremely satisfied -- I normally can't have this type of a cut without spending upwards of $50.   Definitely tip, but I think they pool tips, FYI.

As I was choosing the color the girl came up to me and asked if I was ready. Less than a minute later she comes up to me again and asks if I'm ready. So rude.  When I did sit down for the manicure, she did not take good care of me. She barely used the nippers on my cuticles or skin and filed my nails crooked. Then she left half way through my manicure to do three eyebrow waxings. As if this weren't bad enough, she got polish on my fingers and missed a sizable amount on my pinkies. I will not be returning to this establishment and I hope you will not either. Go to LyLy's across the highway. Better customer service and quality manicure!"", ""My Samsung 650 TV would not turn on. The red light in the front panel just goes on and off. I call Caden. First they charged $40.00 to come over to look at. Then he wrote a bill for $410.00 for repair. I guess I  look old and dumb, but he seems to be sincere. So I let him do the work. Next day, he said he had fixed the problem and will bring over. The TV came back and he gave me a 6 months warranty. I did some research on this problem and found out it is only the capacity problem. And it is relatively cheap to fix. The maximum will cost you for less than $180.00. So, watch out for Caden to sock to you. Call other first before you call him."", ""Bread tasted old and was dry.

There was nothing about the food that can redeem how unusually bad the food was here.  While the staff is very accommodating, you're better off skipping this restaurant.  I worked in a very large well known Cajun/creole restaurant and what we were served was very bland and poorly prepared.  Red beans were definitely from a can. I didn't taste any of the distinct flavors of red beans n rice.  There was no ham hock flavor, no bay leaf flavor or discernible mirepoix flavor.  The collard greens tasted like they had been boiled without any additional seasoning and served, poorly drained. I couldn't eat it.  The jambalaya was also very odd, most definitely from some prepackaged mix.  The jambalaya barely had any meat in it and was definitely not close to anything like jambalaya. They aught to be ashamed of calling that Jambalaya. It was more like frozen mixed vegetable rice pilaf, seriously. Jambalaya \""\""jambon a la aya\""\"" the jambon (ham) is the core of the dish, seriously. Wtf.  If the management is reading this: revise your recipes and quality check often. It's a downward spiral when you sacrifice quality.  One of us who are the crawfish etouffe had terrible food poisoning.  I think there are issues with storage, food rotation, labeling and training.  Several hours after writing the review,  I was sick."", ""Maybe this is the place to go for dinner, but apparently not for lunch!  My coworkers and I sat down to order right around 1 pm and did not get our food until 1:45!!!  Completely unacceptable, considering we only had an hour for lunch & we were the only 4 customers in the place!!!!  We immediately had to pay our bills and put our food directly into to-go boxes...which is not awesome when you order the home made fries, and they become soggy on the ride back to work.  My burger was delicious (once I got a break at the office to actually take a bite). The server was pretty unapologetic about the whole situation, and I really felt like we were a huge inconvenience for him.  If there hadn't been upbeat, Latin music playing throughout the restaurant, I would have mistaken this place for the waiting room at my gynecologist's office....no fun!"", ""Terrible service. Went at 1pm on a Saturday and waited 25 minutes for my order (there were 2 ppl ahead of me with normal, single sandwich orders). First, the guy didn't know how to make my sandwich (a black forest ham) and skipped to the next guy in line until he could get the girl in the back to come make it, leaving me just standing there getting passed over in line. He then put the condiments on and put on an insane amount of mustard. I didn't ask for extra, I just said mustard, thinking he'd run it back and forth 2 or 3 times and that's it. Nope, he squeezed the crap out of the bottle and completely drenched it. Then he can't work the cash register, only the girl can. Just one thing after another.    I then go out front to eat and hear a car at the drive thru placing an order on the touch screen kiosk (which is actually a really good idea), but the girl inside is telling them over the mic they have to come inside to order, that they can't place there order in the drive thru. Employees at this location seriously need some training or help. Go to another location if you can."", ""The only reason for one star is it is the only way the review would post. We had long ago decided not to return to the Avon location after three disappointing visits. We frequented the Lafayette location often and were very disappointed in the service and quality of the Avon location where we now reside.  Tonight we followed our daughter and her family to the Avon location (unaware of where they had decided to go for dinner). This evening topped  the list of terrible restaurant experiences-over an hour wait for food, my daughters steak was cooked well done when ordered medium rare, the steak was remade which had to be boxed and was left at the table because was still cooked incorrectly.  She was charged 9.99 for the remake and that is what was taken off her bill not the price of the original steak&rib dinner.  I ordered the apple pie desert with ice cream which came out before we even received our drinks and without a spoon.  My husband drove back to the location where the manager refused to do anything different about the original charge for the incorrectly cooked steak; needless to say my husband left with the owners phone number.  Mistakes happen - but own them; every bad experience is related to over 20 people, who then in turn, repeat to someone else - so tell me manager of Avon, IN Texas Roadhouse - was it worth it?"", ""I'm not sure what changed over the last year at this restaurant, but now it's just terrible food. Before, when I first started coming, it was decent: nothing fancy, but filling and palatable. Now, though, the food is disgusting. 90% of their buffet offerings are WAY too salty. The pulled turkey was tough, the fish tasted like licking a bottle of meat tenderizer, and the vegetables cooked to a putty-like state. The only thing vaguely edible was the corn pudding and mashed potatoes. The desserts are ok, almost store-bought quality.   The service at least was good. Our waitress refilled our drinks promptly and removed plates often. The only good I saw all night."", ""We attended a private party recently.  The appetizer, cheese ravioli, was good.  That is the only good thing I can say.  I had chicken parm and it was awful.....I actually got a piece of grizzle I had to remove from my mouth. And it was soggy. The red gravy was among the worst I have had EVER.  And the pasta was overcooked.  I could not eat it.  A friend who also attended had the same opinion and did not eat the entr\u00e9e.  I have heard negative comments about Andreas for years now.  Unfortunately this was my first time eating there.  Needless to say, we won't go back.  They should shut the place down."", ""I went when they first opened and I didn't want to judge too harshly because it's a new place. I waited several weeks to try again, even worse!!

So I go to the bar. The bartender is busy with other guest, she says she will be right with me, 15 mins later still haven't been helped. The manager is very present and visible the whole time.  He is yelling at servers and comparing about not doing their jobs. But he doesn't even notice that I have not been helped yet. Finally another bartender helps me and I walk my drinks back to my party. Still nobody has come by our table. We were there for a while and no server has come by and the manager was very oblivious to our distaste or the fact we needed help. On top of that, there was crazy feedback on the music and you couldn't even hear the singing. We finished our beers and went elsewhere. Very disappointing."", ""Stopped by on my way out of Nashville for a quick bite. Mistake. As soon as I walked in the manager made an offensive comment about my appearance (I have long hair and a beard so she referred to me as \""\""baby Jesus\""\"") Not a good start.  Food quality was very poor even for a buffet, and the stock was extremely low on everything, and what was there was cold and unpleasant. Drinks never were refilled.   I tried to salt my food and discovered not one, but all salt shakers were caked with water and unfunctional. When I asked the server for fresh salt she proceeded to check the tables and came back several minutes later with what she claimed was \""\""the best she could find\""\"" rather than making a fresh bottle, and it was just as caked as the others.   If I had to say one positive thing about it, I'd say that I'm 90% positive that the steak was made from actual beef!

It's hot as hell outside, wasps everywhere and we're standing here. I asked about other clean rooms and he (a-hole manager) (neil Patel) sarcastically states check in is at 2. It's 1:45 though. If you're going to check guest in at least make sure the rooms are clean or let them know it will be a few. So I'm standing outside in the heat as they apparently clean the room.

I saw the good and bad reviews, but I'm fair and like to judge from my own experience, so I came in with neutral expectations. I came in with a group of six people. We ordered separately, I was the first to order. However, our food took 25 minutes, and when we asked what the holdup was, no one seemed to know or care. We did end up letting them know the service was poor, and the guy I was explaining to walked away as I was speaking! He flat out did not care.  At this point, that's just plain rude. We tried to complain to the woman managing the floor and her response was, \""\""oh.\""\""  Apparently, we weren't the only ones complaining, as we were walking out, another customer walked in to get her money back because her boyfriend has already been served and finished his food while she still hadn't gotten hers.

Our waitress didn't fill up our water glasses once in the 3 hours we were there, and for our table of 4, she repeatedly got our drinks wrong (but because it took forever to get them, it wasn't worth asking her to correct the orders).

The potted pig was plated creatively having to use a spoon to dive into the pork (texture of a country pate) and then add your toppings from the pickled selections of veggies they gave you either on a cracker or bread.  It was good.... BUT  If you REALLY want a surprising treat, get the Flash Fried Brussels Sprouts! Holy YUM. If Brussels Spouts could ever be considered candy.... you found it here.  They flash fry them and put them in a dish with onions, almonds and bacon! What a TREAT!   I chose (after tasting my buddies last visit) the Pork Chop. And I remembered correctly, it was fantastic! The pork was perfectly seasoned and cooked and they put it over a bed of  sweet potatoes and topped it with apple slaw. So many flavors that melded together perfectly! and YES I ate my entire plate!  Dessert we each got one and shared - table of four here-just for reference ;) We got the S'mores pudding. They topped with semi burned marshmallows. Holy yum. and the pudding  was topped with candied pecans.  I can not recall the name of the dessert our friends got, but we tried it and it was good as well!

Come along with me, as I journey back in time -- all the way back to Wednesday...  I step foot in this 7 Eleven, and the first thing I think is: this is one of the nicest looking 7 Elevens I've ever seen. It is very clean, bright, and spacious. Very nice looking selection of prepared meals. There were many that actually looked like they'd be quite good. But I wasn't hungry this day. No. All I needed were a few items.   First, some good old TP. And let me be perfectly clear (as clear as Barack Obama): I DON'T buy the cheapest toilet paper because I'm cheap. I buy it because I like the way the cheap stuff feels. The more like sandpaper, the better. I like to feel like its working. I don't need to or even want to feel like an angel is up there. Or some perverted freak named Scott.   In any case, I got myself 4 rolls. And then I just needed one more thing - some plastic cups for a little party I'm having this weekend.   I go ahead and drop my stash on the counter, begin to extract several singles from my wallet, when the cashier looks at me and says, \""\""24.99.\""\""  I respond, \""\""That's not right.\""\""  He points at a price tag on the plastic cups which reads 19.99. I begin laughing. I tell him the price is clearly wrong. He tells me he's got to talk to his manager. Meanwhile, I tell the folks behind me waiting in line that I'm just going to go run and get different plastic cups to hurry the process along. Before he got back from doing his price check, I already had another cashier ringing up my two sleeves of cups for 1.99 each. That's more like it.  At around that same moment, the first cashier comes back from his consultation with his manager. He tells me that the price was, in fact, incorrect. And that the price is actually 14.99.  THAT'S the unscrupulous part.  CLEARLY, THAT price is also far too high. His manager did no actual price check at all. He simply told the cashier to pretend that the real price was actually 5 dollars less, thinking that I'd be stupid enough to accept this. Why, because I'm white, and you're a racially superior Indian? You think white people are stupid don't you?

Yet they insisted they could only seat us outside (it was a torrential downpour with thunder and lightning) or at the sushi bar. When we asked about how long it would be to wait for a table they first said about 30 minutes which we agreed to (despite there being 6 open tables) yet then a moment later the manager came over and said it was not possible to wait for a table.

GREAT!... we paid with credit card in advance, we were told we did not have to wait in line to walk right up and let them know we purchased a table with bottle service. when we got there we had to wait in line, we were told we had to wait behind the line divider, which we did, until we asked to speak to someone in charge of table service. we were then met by one of the guys from inside the club where he led us from line into the club, the club was fairly empty and plenty of tables were available and open throughout the night.  The table we were given was a make shift table that sat directly in the walkway of the stairs that led down to the pool area, so everyone that walked by literally walked through our sitting area. The service was great, the girls were very polite and accommodating.  we were there a couple of hours, watched the performance and were having a great time, UNTIL..... a fight broke out near our table, the club security came rushing in to break up the fight and drug the fighting party through our sitting area where our table and drinks were, everything spilled, everything was knocked over and around and the security simply pushed us all out the way and has us pinned up against the wall with nowhere to go, during this time the security guards that pushed all back out of the way had blood all over their hands from the fighters and literally stained our clothing with blood from another party.  after the commotion the club security started directing everyone out of the club through the side exit, we had to literally leave right then and there and were herded outside the building by casino and club security.

A big fat Zero 0.0 for their service/ownership/management.    This place use to be a regular stop for my family and I, but NO more.  My mother, a regular customer, stopped by shortly before lunch time along with my 1 year old child.  She selected a table in the corner because she didn't want to inconvenience customers that may enter, since she had a stroller.  The waiter approached and didn't even even greet her.    Absolutely no other customers were in the restaurant yet she still had to flag down the waiter to order.    8 minutes after her soup was served, and midway through eating her meal, the waiter just plopped the check on the table without her asking for it (very classy).  My mother took the bad service in stride and even left a %15 tip.    As she left with my kid in hand, another waiter ran after her and flagged her down in the parking lot...apparently the owner stated the $10 bill she left was too old and wrinkly...not torn, or damaged, just wrinkly.  My mother didn't want to create a scene, so she took her wrinkly money back, paid with a credit card with no tip, ha!

I had the sonoran dog and received two beef tacos that I did not ask for.  The tacos has scraps of beef with cilantro and onion.  They also have the regular styled tacos with tomatoes and lettuce.  The dog was the last one sitting the bin and a bit soggy.  Compared to truck dogs, it does not compare.  The tacos were simply bits of beef with onion and cilantro, nothing impressive and nothing like what is seen in the pictures.  Perhaps, my disappointing experience was due to how the place was packed, had a line out the door by the time I left, and was somewhat loud, but that is no excuse for the terrible eating experience.

On a side note, I love how the manufacturer sends out a survey within days of buying a vehicle wanting to know how much you love the vehicle.  Not just jeep but they all do it.  I always respond with...give me 6 months to a year so I can drive it in different conditions.  Then I'll let you know.  I never respond with \""\""I love it\""\"" in the first few days.  On my drive home from the dealership I noticed an excessive amount of wind noise coming from the passenger side roof area.  I know this vehicle isn't aerodynamic so don't go there. I understand! But the noise on the passenger side was far more noisy than the driver side.  So, I decided I was going to take it back to have it checked.  In the meantime, the blinker that is supposed to blink three times automatically when you move the lever up or down (not locked) worked intermittently.  Most of the time it did blink three times but occasionally it would only blink once.  So, I added this to the list.  They kept it for two days.  Famous quote...\""\""nothing is wrong\""\"".  So I asked, what did you do for two days.  The answer;  We drove it and the wind noise is normal and the blinker never malfunctioned. So I asked, do you believe me that the blinker occasionally malfunctions or do you think I'm making this up?  They said they believe me.  I asked: So if it did malfunction when you were driving it what action would you take?  It was like a dear looking at me in the headlights.  A blank stare.  He finally said he'd have to call technical service.  I asked why he didn't do that in the first place?  He said he had to diagnose it.  I asked, rather sarcastically, did you have some diagnostic equipment connected while driving it so that if it did happen you could troubleshoot it?  He said no, they just need to see it.  Unbelievable!  He said, as long as it doesn't happen for him, there is nothing wrong.  So, reluctantly on my part, we moved on to the wind noise.  Again, he said there was nothing wrong but...they put down a bead of silicone.  I asked why?  If there is nothing wrong, why put down a bead of silicone?  Because we felt it might help.  If there is nothing wrong and its, as you say, normal, why put down a bead of silicone?  Is there a problem or not?  No problem, we just decided to put down a bead of silicone.  A couple of weeks later (4th of July) I ran my jeep through a car wash in West Chester.  Within an hour, and on a 90+ degree day the A/C unit malfunctioned. Air flow went to a minimum.  I changed fan speed and while I could hear the fan increase in speed there was no change in output.  Minimal air flow and the vehicle started getting hot.  After about an hour and a half of this it finally began running properly again.  I called the dealership and told them what happened.  The answer, unless it does it for us we can't do anything about it.  Are you serious?  Are there louvers in the duct work?  Could one of them have gotten stuck?  Is there an area where water from a car wash could have affected or gotten into something to cause this?  Again, where is the diagnostics in all of this?  Simple answer is always, unless it happens for us we can't do anything about it.  Most frustrating group I've ever dealt with.  I HATE THIS JEEP and the fact there is not one competent person to work on it or someone who will take the initiative to diagnose the issues.  Worst purchase I ever made and what makes it so difficult is now that the sale is done, no one cares!  No one!  Oh, but the survey's keep coming.  Such a joke, an absolute joke.  Oh, to top it off, I was told to take it to David's Jeep in Glen Mills.  Perhaps they can find the problem.  Now that's a comforting thought.

I ask to speak to the manager for a refund. Not only that I hope that the bugs did not get to my small luggage. The guy said he is the night auditor and can't answer any questions.

I had eaten a perfectly acceptible brunch at the original location in Baton Rouge and still had very low expectations...they were not met.      The good first: the service was friendfly and efficient.      The bad: poor quality chips, including some tasting of rancid oil, were accompanied with pretty good salsa and truly tasteless queso. Seriously, the jar of queso in the grocey is eons better.      My lenten crawfish quesedillas were okay, but nothing to write home about and they were probably the tastiest thing to hit our table.      My lovely wife had the not at all lovely (to look at...an amalgam of beiges & light browns in amoebic puddles) Rio Grande plate. Bear in mind, Paige is pretty down with standard American-style mexican if it is fresh, but she was pretty underwhelmed.      The crowd was mostly tourists (from out of town or Metairie/Slidell, etc from the looks of it) so perhaps the lovely setting helped them ignore the pallid dreck proffered here, but its walking distance location will in no way seduce into another visit."", ""We wanted salad for lunch so decided to try this place. The older gentleman given the task of making our salads was a complete jerk. After being rushed to give him my toppings order several times, he told me he had other things to do.

I actually avoided the place for some time and had long wasabi laced affairs with places like Fujiyama in West Nashville.    I recently returned for a late nite bite with a boy and it was significantly mediocre to warrant an update.  Like my crumbling relationship, RuSans chokes itself on sad attempts to dress up what was always low quality.  The washed out party techno and poor lighting is like being in the expositional scene of a romantic comedy set in New York. But not in the good way. The bloated menu is utterly ridiculous and stopped impressing people in 2004. The sushi, like our attempt to still enjoy sharing a meal together, was just pathetic. 90% rice, soggy seaweed, and overloaded with a sweet sauce.  I'm breaking up with you (again) RuSans. I wish you the best but I'm afraid that the Gulch is a big sea and there are plenty of other fish.""]",0

Best Kee Mao in town! Get it \""\""native thai hot\""\"" (if you can handle it). They pretty much have great everything though. I would also recommend the red or green curry. It will literally light your a** on fire. If you are a fan of the \""\""hot and spicy\""\"" like I am, then get the waitstaff to bring you a small bowl of peppers with fish sauce. If your food is not spicy enough, then adding some of those peppers will change that in a hurry.   The place looks completely ghetto on the outside but it actually has a pretty decent interior. So I would say it's a nice quiet atmosphere on the inside. A good place to take a date.

Don't expect it to be more than what it is and you will be really satisfied with your experience. I've ordered delivery from them three times and have dined in once.

The corn tortillas are handmade: very thick, soft, and tasty. The fish portion was generous, and they are dressed with pico de gallo and flavorful creamy sauce.   Pickled onion and radish shavings are served on the side and make a nice garnish, as does their (not too hot) red sauce.   I got the plate, which comes with beans, rice, and a drink. The beans were creamy and had a great flavor. Rice was ordinary , but mix it with the rice, drip a little hot sauce on it and the flavors blend perfectly. You also get pickled carrot slices and they were great too.   I got their homemade horchata, and it was awesome too --cinnamon and spices--just right. They don't serve any alcohol.   The only drawback is the location. It is not in the best part of town.   And note the name--it is a taqueria--a taco shop. You order at a counter and go sit at metal tables.

I told my husband we would need to go elsewhere to eat then. At this point some guy came up to take our order, we commented on the credit card thing and he gave ranted at us for a good while about giving away money because the rate was 3.69% per sale and he cant afford to pay it and the electric and this and that. Like ok whatever dude, you're in business as is the bank you agreed to their terms and conditions when you had it installed to run your business.   He then handed us a menu and said we could order it off of the web from foodcab.net.  At this point I was pretty much over this guys bad attitude and wanted to just walk out of there but my husband was pretty upset as he really wanted BBQ so we ordered off line from the foodcab.net since we could use our credit card.

We ordered our appetizer which came with barely any sauce. There were two other parties that sat down after us but got their food first. When our food came out my fajitas were colder than normal.

43,"[""I always admired the cakes in the window of this store and wanted to order my daughters birthday cake here the last few years. I was very excited when my husband agreed on the Cake Boutique to make our cake for her 5th this year. I wanted a nice five layer cake and no expense was to be spared! I cannot even begin to tell you how shocked I was at their terrible customer service. The lady showed me the different cakes and informed me on how much each one was. I told her I liked the three tier cake but might need something bigger since I specifically wanted five layers. She told me the basic starting price and let me know decorations would cost more. I was fine with that and told her I would like to get the order started. When I asked her if I could taste a few flavors she said they don't let people taste for free but I could buy some cupcakes if I wanted to. When I asked if the cupcakes in the case were all the flavors they made, she just shrugged her shoulders and said \""\""I think so.\""\"" So I bought a chocolate, yellow and raspberry filled cupcake. I sat at the table to taste them ( I noticed after I sat down there was a sign on the table that said \""\""reserved for cake tasting\""\"" ) I then asked her if there was delivery available, since I did not want to risk driving with the cake myself and possibly ruining it. She said for an additional $50 I could get it delivered. I told her my major cross streets and she said she was going to check on something and would be right back. While she was gone I tasted the cupcakes and I could not believe how dry and bland they were. I was really shocked, the raspberry filled one was a little better tasting but not by much. I really cannot tell you what specific flavor they were because she didn't tell me. So as I waited for her I decided not to use them. I can put up with bad customer service if the product is at least amazing but after I sampled it there was no way I was going to pay $600 for a cake and get treated the way I did and have it taste horrible on top of all that. So just because they have a fancy store and nice displays- don't just assume that the service is great and the product is good. I will stick with Nadine's- they have outstanding customer service and the cakes never let me down."", ""This was such a nice change from the other restaurants. Simple fresh organic food.  Full coffee, latte, etc options. Sasquatch brew is delicious. Also, very nice ambiance. Casual, relaxed, and comfortable.

Went at 1pm on a Saturday and waited 25 minutes for my order (there were 2 ppl ahead of me with normal, single sandwich orders). First, the guy didn't know how to make my sandwich (a black forest ham) and skipped to the next guy in line until he could get the girl in the back to come make it, leaving me just standing there getting passed over in line. He then put the condiments on and put on an insane amount of mustard. I didn't ask for extra, I just said mustard, thinking he'd run it back and forth 2 or 3 times and that's it. Nope, he squeezed the crap out of the bottle and completely drenched it. Then he can't work the cash register, only the girl can. Just one thing after another.    I then go out front to eat and hear a car at the drive thru placing an order on the touch screen kiosk (which is actually a really good idea), but the girl inside is telling them over the mic they have to come inside to order, that they can't place there order in the drive thru.

How does a restaurant run out of their signature menu item?! And how did the person who answered the phone fail to tell me that when I called to ask about the wait? I would have appreciated the warning and would probably have delayed my 312 dinner for one more day.   We love the deep dish pizza so much that we decided to stay and try the thin crust. It wasn't until after we ordered, though, that our waitress told us it would be an hour wait! We know that's the deal for the deep dish, but it was doubly disappointing to get to the restaurant, find out they don't have deep dish, and then have to wait an hour for the thin crust (which was okay, but would never have made it on my short list to hit before leaving town).  All in all, it was a disappointing night for what has been one of my favorite Nashville spots. Big bummer.  TL; DR:  call before you go and ask whether the restaurant is still serving deep dish because apparently 312 sometimes runs out of the crust."", ""They call a chicken salad sandwich two cubes of chicken with mayo in it and a salad with a salad that is a bowl Of lettuce a salad?

I was there to enjoy a few drinks and dinner with a friend who was visiting (AKA looking to spend money AKA you will get a larger tip if you let us stay longer) and we were rushed out. Server brought boxes for food we were still eating, without asking if we wanted them.

I point blank asked him if he was kicking us out of the booth and he said \""\""yes!\""\"" energetically. There was no one waiting for tables and there were numerous open tables/booths around the restaurant. I felt extremely uncomfortable and wanted to leave immediately. Our friend joined after all this happened, and when the server came over to ask if they wanted a drink, he seemed surprised when we told him we were just going to leave. YOU LITERALLY just told us we couldn't sit at this table any longer!! We then left.  I worked in restaurants for a long time and I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to restaurant service.

It was objectively a horrible experience, even without comparing it to the hype it receives, and ruined what was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner celebration.   We had a group of 8 that had a reservation made well in advance. Short wait, but not too bad. Keep in mind, it seemed like a normal Friday night, but weren't super busy or at-capacity.  It was a birthday dinner, so I told the hostesses that it was her birthday, and asked if they could bring out something for her at the end of the meal, which was acknowledged. Pretty standard stuff, whether at a Applebee's or the French Laundry. We were sat at a booth right next to the Maitre D' stand, and next to all the wait staff's home base, so pretty much no excuse for not getting any attention.   After getting us waters, it took them a LONG time to even come by and acknowledge us. After ordering wine, it took them another good 15-20 minutes to even bring us our wine, and no one even checked in on us! (hint: if you're running a restaurant, wine is your profit center and doesn't take any work other than taking a bottle off a shelf and opening it. bring it out ASAP...).   After ordering food, it was more of the same...a long wait for food to start coming out and no one checking in on us AT ALL. We drank the bottles we ordered and had to get up and flag someone down to get another wine order. A couple of us even got up during the meal to remind them to bring out something for birthday girl at the end of the meal.   Once our meal was done and taken away, we were given dessert menus and the server disappeared for 10-15 minutes... AGAIN. After coming back, he asked what dessert we wanted, so we ordered some coffees... and waited... and waited. Eventually we got up and asked him what was going on and if they were going to bring anything out like we asked multiple times.   They finally brought out a couple of cookies with a candle...  In summary, the food was pretty hit or miss, pretty mediocre for this price point. Whipped feta, like other reviews have said, was amazing, and the Braised Lamb was really good. But the Sirloin was chewy and bland and the Grilled Caesar tasted like a soggy, luke-warm, wilted mess (two orders were left untouched by a group of 8). Atmosphere was nice and trendy. But the service, which is a huge reason to spend your hard-earned $ at a restaurant, was absolutely horrendous.

No big deal tho, we had an 8pm reservation and the nine of us arrived about ten minutes early, knowing we would most likely have to wait a little. Nothing prepared us for the 45 minutes of waiting that we ended up standing through. The boys were fine, they went to the bar and made friends with what seemed to be like a regular crowd. When we were finally seated and all decided on our dishes (thank goodness), our server began The Countdown. I have never experienced this before but with every course or round of drinks he would come over and tell us \""\""Okay guys, about 7 more minutes\""\"" then return a few minutes later and say \""\""Alright well we have about 3 more minutes left\""\"" and as annoying as it was, he made us all laugh. So it was fine. I ordered the RW special that was salmon stuffed with a crab cake, and it was okay. I would have been fine if the food were on par with a 45 minute wait but it just was not worth it.

I'd say it was almost 10 minutes before they finally came and took out order. I started to wonder who our waitress was because 2 different females took the drink order and delivered them. Finally, one of the females came and took our order, so we must have been there for 15 minutes at least before our food order was taken. 10 minutes had gone by and a lady got sat in the booth next to us. Another 10 minutes later, she got her food before we did. So she got there after us, ordered after us, but received hers before us. Our waitress refilled my husband's coffee twice the whole time and she asked if I wanted a refill on my soda, I shook my head no and she could tell we were wondering where our food was, she says your food is almost ready, the kitchen is overwhelmed right now. But there was only maybe one new customer that came in since we had been there. I told my husband if we didn't get our food in the next 5 minutes, we would just leave.  So, 40 minutes and no food, we walked to the register and asked if we could pay for our beverages and our waitress said our food was almost ready. I said that we didn't want to wait anymore and she said we didn't have to pay for our drinks and we left. No apology, nothing. Im thinking either our waitress forgot to enter our order, or, the 3 cooks in the kitchen just wasn't concerned about how fast the food was being cooked. They did not look flustered, so I honestly don't know what the issue was. Won't be returning.

I changed my apartment within the Lincoln Green as the water from the yard had destroyed the wall. The wall was wet for 3-4 month and the management failed fix it regardless of multiple inquiries. Finally they offered me to move to another apartment and did not compensate for the time and moving expenses. They did not even decrease the rate of the new apartment at least to the rate that I had been paying for the old one.   2. My expensive bicycle was stolen from the second floor balcony. All my attempts to ask for reasonable increased security in the community was useless.   3.

I had about 100 Dollars security deposit that I never received back and because of my busy schedule, I did not really care to follow.

They had never contacted me although they had my new address, email, and phone number. They reported me to collection agency for only 50 dollars.

I'm not even sure where to start. The menu was really strange, with one dish for each type of protein and one very random Thai dish. They were out of the fish, and since steak and chicken didn't sound good, I went with two appetizers as my main dish. Very odd, but the menu was SO small and SO overpriced it's all that appealed.  The meals that arrived were almost worthy of a joke, if we weren't so pissed we were paying for it. My shrimp cocktail consisted of 4 butterflied shrimp that were rather warm. My hubby's \""\""roasted half chicken\""\"" was actually two grilled chicken breasts--which does not equal by any stretch of imagination, a roasted 1/2 chicken. The drink menu was limited as was the wine list. Dessert was just dumb--the only choice was cupcakes--expensive and only came in portions for two. I'm all for friendly service, but our server was waaaay to open and honest with us. It was rather odd. We learned all about her former employment at Starbucks. What? We spent more on our lame meal than we have in long time. I believe it was around$115. We were shocked. What takes the cake though, is the bathroom gender identifiers--each has a wall decal of a dog, one is sitting and labeled \""\""Setters\""\"" and one is standing and labeled \""\""Pointers.\""\"" Classy.

And I was never offered the better option when I walked in.

First, before even going today, I called to find out what the brunch entailed and when Rosie answered the phone I told her that I had a few questions about brunch, she told me to hold and never came back to the phone. I stayed on hold for 8 minutes at which I called back and spoke to someone else who just seemed like \""\""Oh Well.\""\"" This brunch was organized by one of my friends, so choice in location was not something I had. We did have a reservation, but were pushed outside because apparently they only planned for one 8 person table and the other table got there a few moments before us and got to choose. The problem with this is that there were two people in our group that are allergic to bees, myself being one of them, and bees were flying all around our table, especially our food. At one point I had to get away from my seat and was not able to return to it for 5 minutes because the one been landed on my waffle and was not leaving.

The waitress proceeded to run outside and tell the rest of the group that we were moving at which point they decided to stay outside, which was fine by my friend and I, but that meant having to be separated from our friends. This, to me, is deplorable behavior on the side of the the waitress and management. The waitress who was supposed to be our waitress inside as well, never arrived to the table and never checked up on us. Needless to say, I had to get another waiter and he was so appalled with the way that everything was handled he told my friend to not give him a tip. I was so appalled myself, that I did not eat because I just did not want to spend my hard earn money at this establishment any longer.

This hotel fails to get the simple things right and when you fail at that everything else is secondary.   Customer experience: Phase two of the customer experience was the beginning of the issues. There was no clear signage to direct you to the valet when we arrived at 10:30 pm which caused me to circle the block to make another pass and find it.   Phase three the AC system is not adequate at all to cool the room, I set the thermostat to 65 degrees in the living room and the bedroom was still hot and not just for me but my girlfriend as well. The curtains do not block out the sun as they don't close all the way. So instead of a nice long sleep I can't sleep with the heat then the sun bright in early through the window wakes us up.   At this point I got up to take a shower which is one with the horrible cheap shower curtains that divide halfway up. I got the shower curtain with the one half inside the shower and the other half outside. When I finished the shower the floor was soaked. It's annoying because I specifically took the time to get that stupid cheap shower curtain setup right and it still leaked everywhere.   Hopefully they will buy real shower curtains, upgrade the AC, and fix the blinds so people can get a good rest but after this night I'm done with Embassy Suites Tampa.

Great guy and made my test-driving experience one of the best! Unfortunate that the lease deal (that was not in his control) was nowhere close to honest or accurate.   BACKSTORY: Returning a VW Jetta lease just days before my lease is up. Went to Ray Brandt first (and did not just deal with one person, I dealt with 3+ not including Richard) because I initially leased from them and ended up running for the door. Called Southpoint VW immediately after and I have no words for how awesome they were. I'm just going to explain the difference between Southpoint VW and Ray Brandt VW:  RAY BRANDT: I am not in this \""\""90 day period\""\"" to return my car so they will have to do me a PERSONAL favor and take the hit of my return fee and minor scratches (that added up to $1,300 btw). Meaning it was no longer an incentive for me to return my car, it was a personal favor I should be thankful for.  THEN on my quote print out.. there re-appears the $1,300! They snuck it back in my price thinking I would not notice and tried to cover up with some story about taking it out of my \""\""discount\""\"" (but I followed what they were saying, and it indeed was a deception)  SOUTPOINT: No such thing as \""\""90 day period\""\"".. I was leasing another VW, therefore they did not even care to inspect my car. I hand it in as is (assuming I had my 4 doors and bumper of course!).  --------- RAY BRANDT: I wanted the black Tiguan and I had to pay $200 transportation cost to get it from another dealer  SOUTHPOINT: No only did they pick up the black Tiguan from another dealer 100 miles away, they drove it all the way from Baton Rouge to my WORK! NO CHARGE! --------- RAY BRANDT: Expected I pay 70% of the MSRP in 36 months. WHAT?!?! and they had no explanation (except for jargon) when I asked three times for the break down and how that makes sense to THEM.   SOUTHPOINT: Paying 35% MSRP in 36 Months. BEFORE negotiation -------  RAY BRANDT: Any and all incentives (that I knew about beforehand) were now personal favors. Told me the price break-down print out was something they \""\""don't show people\""\""!  Ok, only every other dealership I visited before showed me the print out WITHOUT that fancy line. I give my social, birthday, salary, credit history, and address... I think I more than deserve to know the details of my future car!   SOUTHPOINT: Gave max incentives, honored all deals online, adjusted discount to make whatever I put down still in ratio with other deals for down-payment promos that I wasnt participating in, wrote off $$ on contract based on negotiated prices we had talked about. Gave me all information and price details upfront.  ---------  RAY BRANDT: Jacked the MSRP price $1,200 more than market price claiming when the car comes from Germany it's a bit lower but once it gets to dealership they add things such as \""\""felt trunk separator\""\"" and the \""\""first aid kit\""\"" that factors the price higher. AGAIN... WHAT?!! hah!  SOUTHPOINT: MSRP was $4,000 lower than RAY BRANDT  (SAME EXACT CAR). Mind you- it's not actually \""\""lower\""\"".. this IS the price of the car.  -------  RAY BRANDT: $467/month $1,000 down for basic factory standard Tiguan S 2016 (please look up so you can laugh that I could lease an AUDI for that much).   SOUTHPOINT: $256/month $0 down. SAME TIGUAN S 2016!!  -------  RAY BRANDT: Only saw me as easy $$$ and an ignorant consumer  SOUTHPOINT:  Respected me AND my wallet. They did EVERYTHING to make my experience as convenient as possible, honestly and ethically.   --------  Even if Ray Brandt dealership gave me a deal I couldn't resist, I still wouldn't be able to sign the contract because I don't trust them."", ""Delicious, fresh sushi.

The selections for protein are mostly raw, so if you're not into that, there's not much here for you. You create your bowl by picking either greens or rice and adding protein (3 or 5 scoops), vegetables, toppings and sauce. They complete the bowl by adding a pretty, edible flower. This is such a nice touch! My bowl was excellent!!! I had rice with octopus, shrimp and salmon topped with mango, pineapple and a sweet sauce. The combination was a stellar one. So many great flavors came together for an awesome experience. The cost for my small Poke Bowl and a drink came to about $13. It was a little expensive for a casual lunch, but worth the experience.

48,"[""As a caveat, I give this place one star for the following reasons: the owner of this place is a very reasonable woman, and previous to my last god AWFUL experience here she gave me a great wax/facial several times, and was completely professional.  HOWEVER, my problem w/ this place was the massage I had. I read a comment below from a woman who had a masseur named Kai, and I had a similarly awful experience with this man.  Let me start by saying that I brought my roommate w/ me to get massages before we had final exams last spring, and that we both had an equally unpleasant experience. First of all, we did not know we'd have masseurs giving us massages until we got to the place. Secondly, we waited about an hour our massage, and we arrived to the salon fifteen minutes early to be courteous and on time.   Anyway, the SAME thing happened to me-- the masseur, Kai, kept the blanket off me for too long, and he rubbed a bit higher than most masseurs are supposed to. He also  creepily suggested to me that I should be a lingerie football model during the massage. Fortunately for me, I was not alone w/ this man. My roommate was in the same room (although we had requested to be in separate rooms, which was very weird).  I would also like to add we could hear the man in the next room getting a massage b/c the rooms were only separated by curtains. The entire process was disturbing and uncomfortable, and I'm alarmed this woman still has a business going.   Oh wait- there's more. My roommate's masseur also argued with her that he was rubbing as hard as he could when my roommate asked for more pressure. We both asked for deep tissue massages, and the guys honestly didn't do much else but rub us down inappropriately w/ some oil. We are very easygoing people, but when you pay over 100.00 for an hr massage, we expect to get what we paid for. My roommate's masseur also ran to the bathroom during the massage, and let's just say the doors were very, very thin... and we heard everything. He then tried to massage her afterwards, but we were both so grossed out by the two men that we asked to leave early.  The massages were HIGHLY inappropriate, disturbing, and uncomfortable. Like the other woman commented below, my masseur, Kail, got way too close to certain areas to the point where I had to ask him to stop because I was so uncomfortable. He also did not cut his nails before the massage, and I had a red scratch mark on my upper back for weeks. He ALSO told me to call him if I wanted a further massage. Needless to say, the only person I ever called from that salon again was the manager the next day to get my money back for the service-- she even offered me a free facial, but I said that wouldn't be necessary b/c I was never coming back.  This all happened last spring, and I honestly I probably blocked this experience out of my mind until I recently looked up reviews myself for a salon in the Philly area.  I'm also very shocked the manager has decided to keep these two shmucks around."", ""Went here with my friends and I had a horrible experience.

The nigiri rice were hard little balls that you could hardly bite into and they made a nice thud when they fell onto the plate. I will never ever go back.  We couldn't finish any of it, it was disgusting.  Don't risk it. It's not worth it. There are so many better places in town."", ""I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. Their biggest mistake is not having a customer service department. They rely on their sales team to provide customer service meaning every time you call in to try and get something done, you get put into a voicemail because the sales guy is out selling - which should be their only job. This left me on numerous occassions incredibly frustrated that I could not get an answer. I even left the manager a voicemail (big surprise I couldn't get them to answer) and they never had the decency to call me back - Just made my sales person call me back.  I purchased my car last July and was promised numerous things would be done to the car before I purchased it. One of which being the tint on the rear window would be removed as the view out of the back was blurry. Somehow, that passed thru inspection and when I came to sign the papers, I noticed that it was still on the back windshield. I was told that they would have it removed by the time we were done the paperwork. Also, I was told that the price was going to be higher than the original agreement because the sales manager did the math wrong the previous day when we ran numbers. I told him that wasn't my fault and I would only pay the agreed upon amount and he spoke with the manager and got it sorted out.   After sitting in the office for 2.5 hours, they finally told me that they were unable to even start taking off the tint and I would have to bring the car back. I dropped it off that Friday and let them keep it for the weekend. My sales guy called me on Saturday night to tell me that they never got to finish it and I would have to bring it back again and leave it. I live 45 minutes from the dealership so this isn't something I can easily do. I insisted on them giving me a loaner car for whatever day they would do this as I was sure this wouldn't be a one day process from my previous experience. 2.5 weeks later they were able to provide me with said car and I dropped off my vehicle. When I went to pick up my \""\""finished car\""\"" there was still tint left on the bottom of the windshield.   After all of that I knew I would never bring my car back for service there if that's the kind of service they provide. Now with all the rain we've been having, my trunk is leaking and when I called to check with the service department to see if it would be covered under warranty, I got the same run around with the service department who just said \""\""I don't know\""\"" - OK well give me someone who will be able to tell me. Once they forwarded me to the correct person, I again got \""\""I don't know\""\"". We need you to bring it in and look at it then submit to our warranty company to see if it gets accepted. No thanks after my previous experience of bringing my car in there to get \""\""serviced\""\"".   Invest in a customer service department to handle complaints in a professional and timely matter. This should not in any way be left upon the sales department to do. My sales guy did the best he could and I appreciated the help he gave me, but no one else would help me throughout the entire process.

We forgot to through it out before the tenting and left the full bucket in the yard.   I called Jhonny's and asked for someone to come out and explain why they did this and clean it up. Two days later someone came over to look at it. They didn't bother cleaning it up and they lied, saying they got dirt from the ground and not the bucket. I told Jhonny's employee it was to much of a coincidence that the bucket of poop was entirely empty and the area where they had to add dirt smelled of poop.

Nobody in my party enjoyed their eats and nobody would come back.   The burgers sounds delicious from the description but in reality they are boring, dry, and void of any sort of flavor. I don't know how the Century Group can keep these locations afloat let alone keep expanding.   It's really not that hard to make even a decent burger and somehow Deluxe Burger Bar fails.

They were very friendly and said they would have it done quickly, which was appreciated. When I came back to pick up my car three hours later, they charged me $75 dollars for the oil change. The guy working the counter could tell I was shocked (an oil change at the dealer usually costs $35).  He explained they had used synthetic oil. When I asked why they would give me synthetic oil when I didn't ask for it, he gave me some BS answer that it was standard for Toyotas. Since he could tell I was upset, he said they were running a special and knocked down the price by 25%.

I saw the four star average reviews and figured it would be tasty. Be warned. It is WAY overpriced, and the food wasn't even good. The mozzarella sticks looked and tasted like the frozen ones you buy at the grocery store. They were $7.99 for five small sticks. Not worth it. Then came the entrees. Everything on the menu had cute names and sounded delicious. My husband ordered Chicken Parm, and I had the Baked Ziti. It was awful. I mean... not good at all. His chicken was \""\""ok,\""\"" but not crispy on the outside like parm should be. Mine didn't have the brown, bubbly, cheesy top you'd normally see on baked ziti. The mozzarella cheese was barely even melted. The sauce tasted like it came from a jar. It was weak and not very flavorful. I had about five bites and didn't even take my leftovers home for the kids.   Save your money and go to Olive Garden instead.

I have no idea what any of their names were. They give NO REFILLS on anything (soda, tea, lemonade, etc) which I think is insane! So they recommend buying a pitcher. The pitchers and ice bucket were both in plastic containers you can get from the dollar store.   We wait nearly 2 hours for our food. Majority of our party ordered mac & cheese as a side. Once we got our plates we noticed their was shrimp in our mac & cheese. When we questioned our server, she responded \""\""Oh I thought she told you we ran out\""\"".

I saw some comments about the regular ribs not being fall of the bone, and I've had the same experience, but typically if you want fall off the bone then you should be going with baby backs.  I'd also recommend the brisket over the pulled pork, hands down.  Corn muffins are good also!

Ever since I was little, my dad got me on putting condensed milk on fruits, cake, crackers and smoothies. I didn't think anyone else knew about this until I came here! I just HAD to get it on my ice cream so I chose the strawberry shortcake with the toppings of graham crackers, whipped cream and strawberries. With of course the condensed milk as my drizzle all for $7. Can't beat that. Employees wore gloves and everything looked clean.

This is one of the (now) two Vietnamese restaurants I've crossed in New Orleans with this particular style of lemongrass chicken (the other being in Gretna, to which I kinda hate to traverse), and I THOROUGHLY appreciated it. Had it with rice, and I enjoyed two fairly interesting drinks with it, though I can only currently recall the names of them while looking at the menu. My fault: bad short-term memory. Back in task--the plate had enough food on it to eat twice if you eat moderate meals, and the prices are extremely modest, especially considering the area and the style of food--frankly, there are far less flavorful options for steeper fare, so the fact that it was happy hour was only the cherry on top. Only spent about $27 before tip. Had a bit of conversation, since it was a little slower, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself in every way. I smiled from the time I entered (AND WAS IMMEDIATELY GREETED) to the time I left and got into the car, where I checked in and began writing this review. In my time there, I didn't get to try the much-lauded whiskey sunrise, about which most of the visiting Yelpers have previously raved, but the other two cocktails I purchased were enjoyable, and it's more than safe to say I will definitely be back with company to try it out."", ""I am a huge fan of Gennaro's.

I finally gave in to ask someone to search for this books location or these books, this guy behind the information desk said I'm looking in the warehouse not in the store...

I had a two month build up prior to finally eating from here and it wasn't anti climatic.  First, this place is local to me. It's located in the Tower Grove South neighborhood in a nondescript building. They have free wifi and ample plugins for electronics... Which would have been handy had I ate in as my Macbook's battery is exhausted these days.  If you can't bring yourself over there or feel comfy in your PJs, no fear! There is delivery available through the bike waiter for $2.99 (or through Eat24 - who uses the bike waiter, but offers a weekend coupon)  They offer breakfast and lunch, but all I have had is breakfast. What have I had?  French Toast sticks... I feel like I was told there would only be three pieces, but I got four... Not those wimpy French today sticks from the freezer aisle, but actually French toast cut into strips. They come with the best syrup ever.   Triple Quasar burrito. I uploaded a pic of this and it really was huge. Huge doesn't always translate into tasty with burritos, but this one was great. I am not sure if I like this as much as the one from tortilla grille, but they're totally different so it's hard to compare... This one was less separate components, more blended together - which is good for consistent taste, but makes it harder to pick out individual flavors.

The dips were really special hummus style and change - we had beet (beautiful color, nice earthy taste), sardine (a bit fishy for my taste, but the rest of my party devoured it) and a third veggie one (my favorite).   I had the smoked cod with basmati rice and boiled egg. Though it isn't a traditional brunch meal, it was a great meal with good flavors and the right portions.   My mom went with the featured Cyprus breakfast and what looked like hash browns is actually a greek styled cheese, very delish. I would recommend this dish for those looking for brunch fare.   Their almond milk drink is mmm, yum, very thick and sweet - great for breakfast add-on.

The chicken and waffles were unreal and standout A++++.  I love the \""\""flinstones pushup-pop\""\"" drink so creative and clever. Even the deviled eggs were the best I've personally ever had.

Our waitress didn't fill up our water glasses once in the 3 hours we were there, and for our table of 4, she repeatedly got our drinks wrong (but because it took forever to get them, it wasn't worth asking her to correct the orders).

I had made arrangements for someone to watch our daughter so we can have a fun evening as a couple. We love to try new places and after a little search, I found Taverna on groupon. The menu sounded wonderful and with it being in Broadripple, I thought this would be perfect opportunity to go to the Corner Wine Bar afterward.     This place is a little expensive and because of that, I though the atmosphere would would have been more intimate with cozy seating and dimmed lighting. Instead, an Applebees has a more romantic setting.   We were greeted with kindness, the service was really good, and the white sangria was fantastic which would have earned this place two stars but the way the lady handled my call, telling her my wife and I got food poisoning, made me take that other star away.    We ordered one pitcher of the sangria, calamari, we each had the 8oz filet mignon wrapped in bacon - my wife's portion was larger than mine with more sauce - and lastly tart for dessert. The calamari was really good, the meat was cooked to how we like it and and the meat by itself was really good. However my wife thought the blue cheese on her filet tasted funny and scrapped it off. We both love blue cheese too.   After our meals we got our dessert. It tasted awful and we could not finish it. However we were polite and didn't say anything. Now, if I was the server, I would have asked if anything was wrong with it because we only ate a couple bites and we didn't want the rest to take home. Oh well, the total damage was more than $100 but we had a groupon, taking a huge chunk of it away.   We sat at our table for a few more minutes after they cleared it and discussed going to our next location. Unfortunately, we didn't make it. Once we got into the car, we had to go home and it quickly went downhill.    I called the place on Saturday to tell them about our Friday night experience. The lady said that no one else had complained about their food, no one else got food poisoning and then acted like she didn't care. She didn't even say sorry.    Because this place has only been open for a little over a year and pricey, I would have expected someone to have handled this in a little nicer way. Having a child and dealing with food poisoning kills not only a date night, but an entire weekend.   On a positive note, I'm sure I lost a pound or two of my 'winter' weight - thanks Taverna."", ""SO GOOD!  My friends and I came here after a long day rock climbing on Mt Lemmon.

I ordered the Beef Gyro with \""\""greek fries\""\"", which I would suggest %100. They were seasoned so well, with lemon and other things I couldn't name. I was just so impressed by this small, modern, simple yet incredibly delicious Greek restaurant. Ive worked in very fancy restaurants, yet I would direct anyone to ZOE Mediterranean instead of McMahons or other overpriced menus.   As we were finishing up our meal, the owner brought out some free, fresh hummus and pita bread, saying, \""\""You should have told me you are starving students!

It looks like someone has it out for this place.   I am surprised Yelp has not filtered them a little better.... they are usually so good at that!   If you see reviews that look insincere or questionable, hit the flag button!"", ""I have no further interest in speaking with the owners about their terrible service, lack of communication, and sub-par floral displays.  I stand by my review of this establishment and once again urge other potential customers to look elsewhere for flowers if you are holding a large social event.  My event did occur and Pure's endless stream of lies DID happen.  Thankfully our guests were able to ignore the lackluster flowers and have a good time regardless.  It is great to have a site like Yelp where businesses can be held responsible for their unscrupulous behavior."", ""Best nail salon. Only place that puts up with my particularity.

I ordered 3 crepes ($30 Groupon), 2 savory, 1 sweet, and each was the essence of perfection. The crepe itself was soft with a warm buttery flavor and had a slight crispiness to the outside. Just incredible. The inside was well seasoned (savory) and had just the right balance of ingerdients.  After taking the first bite, it was so good that I didn't know if I could stop myself from stuffing it into my mouth as fast a possible, but I knew that I should slow down to savor every morsel.  The service was perfection and the only drawback was the slightly high prices. But hey, you get what you pay for. I will definitely be coming back...and bringing all of my friends :)"", ""My order was 75% wrong and when I got home to divvy out the food I had ordered, items were missing including a burger"", ""Food is below average. Waiter is unfriendly.. I asked which dishes are less spicy, he said dismissively: all of them are spicy because Indian food is spicy.. OK, they never brought a chutney tray and we never asked.

First of all, my friend booked us a suite for the bachelorette party she was planning. They gave us two separate rooms and my friend had to beg for them to be at least next door to each other since they ran out of suites. Then to make up for it, they threw in free valet. The next day her car had been keyed on her door when the valet brought it from the parking garage. Seriously? Worst experience and I certainly won't ever be back."", ""Greta hike!

It was objectively a horrible experience, even without comparing it to the hype it receives, and ruined what was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner celebration.   We had a group of 8 that had a reservation made well in advance. Short wait, but not too bad. Keep in mind, it seemed like a normal Friday night, but weren't super busy or at-capacity.  It was a birthday dinner, so I told the hostesses that it was her birthday, and asked if they could bring out something for her at the end of the meal, which was acknowledged. Pretty standard stuff, whether at a Applebee's or the French Laundry. We were sat at a booth right next to the Maitre D' stand, and next to all the wait staff's home base, so pretty much no excuse for not getting any attention.   After getting us waters, it took them a LONG time to even come by and acknowledge us. After ordering wine, it took them another good 15-20 minutes to even bring us our wine, and no one even checked in on us! (hint: if you're running a restaurant, wine is your profit center and doesn't take any work other than taking a bottle off a shelf and opening it. bring it out ASAP...).   After ordering food, it was more of the same...a long wait for food to start coming out and no one checking in on us AT ALL. We drank the bottles we ordered and had to get up and flag someone down to get another wine order. A couple of us even got up during the meal to remind them to bring out something for birthday girl at the end of the meal.   Once our meal was done and taken away, we were given dessert menus and the server disappeared for 10-15 minutes... AGAIN. After coming back, he asked what dessert we wanted, so we ordered some coffees... and waited... and waited. Eventually we got up and asked him what was going on and if they were going to bring anything out like we asked multiple times.   They finally brought out a couple of cookies with a candle...  In summary, the food was pretty hit or miss, pretty mediocre for this price point. Whipped feta, like other reviews have said, was amazing, and the Braised Lamb was really good. But the Sirloin was chewy and bland and the Grilled Caesar tasted like a soggy, luke-warm, wilted mess (two orders were left untouched by a group of 8). Atmosphere was nice and trendy. But the service, which is a huge reason to spend your hard-earned $ at a restaurant, was absolutely horrendous.   I really love going to cool, popular restaurants and having a great time, and I hate writing such a negative review, but I had to share my experience, especially for a restaurant that is getting an awful lot of (undeserved) hype."", ""Overpriced and pretentious...this outfit charges 2x the normal price for everything.  Didn't try all of the 17 restaurants, but what I did have was just average.   Rooms weren't even as nice as the much lower priced Hampton Inn.    Cannot express how disappointed I was.  Seemed like if you just looked at something they charged you for it.    The interior gardens were nice but really not worth it. This is Disney World for adults"", ""Inspect your food before you put it in your mouth! Ordered the Spicy Tuna Roll last night and am now battling the worst case of food poisoning the world has ever known - think projectile vomiting- . The tuna was mushy and the color was too dark, like it had been sitting out at room temperature all day. This place needs to be inspected. Avoid this place."", ""I recently bought $50 worth of hair products I was specifically looking for.  While I looked three salespeople were in a conversation a few aisles away.  When I was walking toward the cashier, one asked if I needed any help.  Yes about ten minutes ago!  The first thing the cashier asked me was, \""\""What's your phone number?\""\""  Really?  No \""\""hello\""\"", have you found everything you were looking for?\""\""  I responded it was unlisted. She looked panicked and told me it didn't go anywhere.  Then why ask?  She then asked me if I had a daughter?  I could give her phone number.  OMG, totally inappropriate question.  Besides if I'm not giving you my phone number why would I give you my daughter's she assumed I had?  I told her I don't give out personal information.

I was extremely unsatisfied, This place is over priced and the food was cold."", ""Good, steady Saturday business but they're a bit slow. They only have one person doing the Pre-wash, and while thorough, it slows up the line.  No military discount, but they do offer one for law enforcement. Nice waiting area with tv, pinball, bowling game, Galaga and...Ms. Pac-Man!!! 5 stars for that!! However, they lose 4 of those stars for shabby work. My rims looked absolutely horrible! Apparently, the car washing gauntlet does not reach the wheels/rims. Additionally, they completely failed to wipe any of the brake dust from any of the 4 rims. I called one of the attendants to re-do the rims but the 2nd go round wasn't much more remarkable.  For the $25 \""\""St. Charles\""\"" wash, I'd like my rims to be washed and shining!  Do not EVER go here for your auto needs."", ""Ignorant bartender. Took forever for him to wait on you at a table on a Sunday afternoon, not even during football season.  Lesson learned. Never have a bartender wait on you for food.  Number 1, they don't want to do it, but also, they don't know the menu or anything about the kitchen when you ask a question. This is a typical suburban blue collar and millennial underwhelming establishment to watch Sports in with a pint of flat Budweiser.

I asked about the contents of the wallet and discovered that everything was present except for a $100 bill that I had just gotten the night before. I have witnesses to the $100 bill being in the organizer.   I went today to retrieve the organizer and met with the assistant manager, who told me it was not their responsibility to keep track of guests belongings and would not investigate the issue whatsoever. She would not approach the server, would not ask who turned the organizer in, would not ask who stored it in the safe and essentially told me it was not her problem.   This is customer service at it's worst... I have no recourse at this establishment to even try to get my money back. I am incensed that they won't even conduct an investigation for me."", ""Loud loud loud!  And the food sucks. They got new management not too long along, doubt they made an improvements."", ""It saddens me to say this but I think I need a new nail salon. I have consistently come here for a few years now and the service has never been as bad as it has been the last few times I've been here. Here are my issues:  1) the girl at the front desk never once looked up from her papers while \""\""greeting\""\"" me and asking me what I want. She mumbled under her breath to go pick out a color then yelled across the salon that I was getting a mani and pedi.  2) once I picked out my color I went back to the front and someone who came in after me was seated in a pedi chair, water turned on etc. to get service. Once she saw that I was standing in the front she got a chair going for me. The problem with that is there were no more nail technicians available to work on me. 3) so now I'm sitting in cold water waiting for someone to come and do my feet.  4) the pedicure started, she painstakingly dug into my toes (which I absolutely hate) and rushed through the Massage part of the pedi 5) after it was all said and done, I find out that their prices have gone up!   I used to come here because they have later hours and are open on Sunday's but after a 3rd terrible experience here I am not coming back.

I'd rather drive out of town then waste my money going here.   Today I decided to give them another try only because there was a free screening being offered.  Gofobo apparently rents space to do screenings at Loews.  I understand it is a separate company.  I understand that they are not affiliated but when you rent space to a company that poorly runs events at your facility it is a reflection on your business as well.  That aside, a little courtesy and  goes a long way.  I do not understand why people with no customer service skills decide to work in a service industry.  How they become managers is also a mystery.   Gofobo offered a free screening at Loews today.  The representative stated that over 500 tickets were issued for the screening.  As a matter of fact, while I was at the theater I was able to see that tickets were still being offered online.  However, after a 1 hour wait (longer for many others) we were told that the theater was full. I do not remember the exact number but the theater held less than 200!  Less than 200 yet over 500 tickets were given out!    Here is where I have an issue with Loews.  I asked to see the theater manager.  I was upset that I had wasted my day.  I had gotten a baby sitter for my infant son and planned to have a day with my daughter.  We went out in the rain expecting to see a movie and after waiting in a line for an hour while peoples purses were searched and a few people were let in at a time we were then told the theater was full.  We were told to leave our email address and we would be issued tickets for a future screening.  I waited for a manager.  What a waste.  The manager, \""\""Nicole\""\"" was very rude.  All she needed to say was, \""\""I am very sorry.  I understand\""\"".  Instead she stared at me and only said, \""\""OK\""\"" in response to everything I said to her.  No Nicole, it is not OK.  It is not okay that my time was wasted.  If you couldn't offer to let us into a different movie how about at least offering some empathy and simply saying I am sorry for the confusion then pass the blame onto Gofobo.  I feel sorry for your staff.  I hope you do not treat them as poorly as you treat customers!  Time to brush up on your customer service skills!  You really do not belong working in management in the service industry.    My past experiences with Loews have been poor.  We were there a few months ago and it was gross.  The floors and cup holders were sticky.  Food spilled everywhere.  The bathrooms were also gross.  This was the second bad experience in a row.  I had said then that I would not be back.  The only reason I gave them another try was because it was a free screening.  In the future, free wont even get me to go back there.  They have permanently lost this family as customers."", ""Took my bigger dog there for grooming.  She came home with cuts in her ear and uneven fur in the front.  Who knows what else was done wrong.

We frequented the Lafayette location often and were very disappointed in the service and quality of the Avon location where we now reside.  Tonight we followed our daughter and her family to the Avon location (unaware of where they had decided to go for dinner). This evening topped  the list of terrible restaurant experiences-over an hour wait for food, my daughters steak was cooked well done when ordered medium rare, the steak was remade which had to be boxed and was left at the table because was still cooked incorrectly.  She was charged 9.99 for the remake and that is what was taken off her bill not the price of the original steak&rib dinner.  I ordered the apple pie desert with ice cream which came out before we even received our drinks and without a spoon.  My husband drove back to the location where the manager refused to do anything different about the original charge for the incorrectly cooked steak; needless to say my husband left with the owners phone number.

Not what most expect with jazz bar/dining establishment. Not dark or comfy seating. I got a mojito and I do not think they could spare the mint. They had a sign about a cover charge at 8. They came over and said if we were still there at 8 eating we would be charged. The food was nothing special. It was about equal with Zattarans box foods. The shrimp they served in the jambalaya and gumbo could not be smaller. Service was lacking. They may want to look at improving the food and entertainment to fill their very empty establishment before they focus on a cover charge. To add the music was not worth the five and was not really jazz bar type. The bar was also cheaply done. If they do not change they will be gone in six months.  Hmmm trying to find a positive kids menu was decently priced."", ""A great place for cheap, ripe produce. Because it's ripe, it's better to buy as you need rather than in advance for a week.

This isn't Greek; it isn't even Mediterranean. It's pseudo-Americanized versions of Mediterranean classic cuisine. The corporate chefs got so many things wrong:  Skordalia is a classic Greek dip made out of potatoes and garlic (not bread).  Avgolemono is chicken soup with egg, lemon and rice -- not this thin, awful broth they are currently serving. If one wants true Greek cooking, one should go to Greektown in either Detroit or Toronto.  Just say no."", ""We wanted salad for lunch so decided to try this place. The older gentleman given the task of making our salads was a complete jerk. After being rushed to give him my toppings order several times, he told me he had other things to do.

I found my waffle very thin and tasteless...not, like the old Farmer Boy restaurant. I also asked why our orders were so delayed and the manager(?) said that they were working on the waffle maker and were also working on the kitchen systems as well...Well, you would think they would have  work out these  problems before opening a restaurant and they have been in this business for many years.

A friend of mine, and the only one amongst us from Louisiana, responded. The manager came back with a comment about my friend being from a trailer park when he heard where he was from (he's never lived in a trailer). So immediately not a good impression.  We get seated, the manager tells us our server is going to be male, a female shows up. Clearly bad communication. The waitress greets us and asks how we're doing and I return the question. She responds that she has been better. I'm a server and I know from experience, even if you're having a bad day, you don't show it or just come right out and say it.  The waitress suggests homemade hurricanes to drink. Two of the people in my party decide to try one. They were horrible. They were so potent u could hardly drink them. They definitely needed to add a little juice. Some cornbread with a honey sauce came to the table. It was very good! As an appetizer, the 4 of us split a sampler platter.... Which took 25 minutes to hit the table. The shrimp were good. The catfish was plain. The salmon patties were just OK. The red beans were pretty good. The turnip greens were very bitter. Overall not impressed.  For our entrees: One friend got the rib eye, it was undercooked. His wife got a blackened fish. The only reason the fish was \""\""blackened\""\"" was because it was burnt. My fianc\u00e9 got the jambalaya and catfish plate. The jambalaya was decent but the catfish was again plain. I had the shrimp scampi.

I am 2 months into my membership and have only been able to use the service in one out of four attempts. I was understanding after the first cancellation and simply rescheduled my appointment. After the second time, I asked to extend my membership for another month as I had gone a full month without having been able to use it. I was told my membership could not be extended as it was a voucher and I was given a $25 credit to my account for a 'future cleaning' in compensation.   I have now been canceled on a third time. Today I didn't even receive a phone call. I received only an email, though curiously it states that they were \""\""recently in touch\""\"" to let me know about the cancellation. Perhaps they were confused and were thinking of the last 2 times they cancelled? That aside, the email was sent an hour before the scheduled start time. Apart from the general inconvenience of being cancelled and left with a house that needs to be cleaned, I had left work early (using personal time) and was on my way home to receive the cleaner by the time I saw the e-mail. The e-mail provided no contact information, only links to Facebook and Twitter accounts. I found a phone number on a previous e-mail from one of the client account specialists who had contacted me following a previous cancellation so I called that number. I spoke with a lovely gentleman who confirmed that I have experienced a high number of cancellations. He told me that a member of the Trust and Safety Department was to have contacted me previously to follow up regarding my first 2 cancellations. I let him know that I had received no such call.  He told me that I would receive a call from that department, most likely later today, to hopefully resolve the issue. We'll see if that happens but I know for sure that I will not be recommending you to anyone and I will be contacting the BBB for a resolution if your team doesn't provide a refund for the 'membership' that I have been unable to use.  UPDATE: The company ended up refunding me $20 (I was asking for $30 to cover the cost of the membership I was unable to use) so that was at least something. The person who emailed me apologized and told me that the frequent cancellations were due to limited availability in my area. I find it disingenuous to give that as an excuse after I went to the site, I looked at a calendar of available times for a specific cleaner and chose from those times and was even sent a confirmation. If those times weren't available then they shouldn't be listed. Limited availability, to me, would mean I would have a difficult time booking the appointment in the first place, not be cancelled on at the last minute.   As they are a broker site (which I didn't realize at first) and not the actual provider company, these cleaners accept jobs booked from the site and I assume then cancel if a higher paying opportunity comes up.  If that's the case, there should be a system in place that penalizes the cleaners for canceling (since the consumer is penalized for a last minute cancellation) or better yet does not allow them to book through the site after a certain number of cancellations."", ""The Cuban was one of the best I have had.

Anastacio gave us a personal tour of this beautiful B&B which left us in awe! We are accomplished travelers accustomed to first class and not easily wowed or impressed but were thoroughly pleased with this gorgeous B&B! From the free range chickens to Juanita the friendly Yellow Lab, the animals were totally obedient to Anastacio's commands! We enjoyed 2 fabulous gourmet breakfast's one in our suite and one in the sun filled dining room by the crackling wood hearth fireplace . There also were different pastries baked daily for our enjoyment. The pool and hot tub are nice for summer stays! The grounds are beautiful to look at or walk about! The resort is by no means ever crowded so if you're looking for peace and quiet away from the crowds this is for you! We went into the classy towns of New Hope and Peddlers Village for shopping and dining but both times we cut our trips into town short just to be back and enjoy the beautiful room and facility! You really will want to just hangout at the Inn it's that nice and peaceful! We had a one hour couples massage in our Suite on Sunday around 11:00 which I highly recommend. We also highly recommend the Carriage ride through town by Bucks County Carriages departing from the farm. It's about an hour excursion and so worth it! We would like to give a special thanks to the owners Mike & Luisa and their very capable & wonderful staff Anastacio & Judy for making our getaway very romantic and special! We felt like family while there! It truly lives up to all the great reviews, hype and accolades! We also enjoyed 2 great dinners at Marsha Brown's & The Inn At Bowman's Hill. This truly is a AAA 4 Diamond rated B&B resort perfectly situated within minutes to all the area attractions. I can not find anything negative to report and can't wait to go back. We live less than 2 hours away so it's an easy getaway for us! We are real people who rely heavily on honest, true and precise reviews so I hope this helps YOU make your mind up! Feel free to email me for additional information at jcandelaria@ goberkscounty.com.  Sincerely,  Jose & Louise Candelaria"", ""Terrible American Mexican restauraunt. Extremely bland food. Excessively uncomfortable seating.  Had the fish tacos. Got food poisoning. Our chips had hair in it.   I'd rather eat at Taco Bell even if i had to pay the same ridiculous prices they have at Las Tortugas. 2nd worst restaurant I've been to in my life."", ""Thank goodness someone said don't worry about the number of reviews! I just walked in today and got a hour massage (half hour chair, half hour feet) for $60. Highly recommend David!"", ""Wednesday night 8/24/16. Talk about bad.. Wow... All I can say. This place has taken a massive backward step since my wife and I use to frequent the location often while she was in hospo at Ruths down the road...The girl at the bar was a completely unprofessional.. Essentially asked us to leave and gave no reason. When we asked for the bill after 1 drink she knew she was in the shit so much she crossed her name out on the receipt to avoid detection (3 times despite us asking specifically for her name and a full unaltered receipt for my records) she  kept  giving us torn off versions  without her name or the name of the place)   We visited after a cards game. I had taken my team out to celebrate wins at our organization and I was shocked at how my team was treated. No sooner had we arrived - 1pm - with [ 9 ] people , we were given the cold shoulder... The door says open until 3 am  but it was like the girl at the bar resented us for arriving....  Dark hair girl: was so rude she basically told us she didn't want to serve us. Everyone was happy but no-one was drunk.. She was extremely rude and short with everyone. We had chosen to leave PBR to Calicoes because I like the place  ?!? Weird... The police man [ Willis ] at the bar was professional when we complained but said he could do anything,  even he seamed perplexed by the dark haired girls attitude...  Even the other bar guy was saying she should chill.  Anyway.. Wow :. What a rude and disrespectful representative  for calicoes.. I use to like this place and sooo disappointed that it's gone downhill so much .."", ""I'm really not sure why I keep going back here-maybe because it's the only subway I know of between City Ave and Wayne, but I should stop. The customer service is worse each time I go back. The woman who works there is incredibly slow and the younger man is slow & rude. I'm not sure why making a sandwich for me is such a burden for someone who works in a sandwich store. But maybe it's because I'm interrupting his chainsmoking.  This morning the man decided that he should take his time to finish preparing his coffee before he got around to making my sandwich. And apparently he isn't clear on the fact that you should wash your hands before you prepare food- gloves or not!

I've been ordering here for seven years and tonight I ordered the usual for the family and it was horrible.  They couldn't even get the burger right. We ordered four combos, three with onion rings rings and one with fries. They put the one onion ring on the burger and they gave us all fries and screwed up the donair's. we called and complained about the order and they said we will remake it free of charge.  But they still screwed it up!  The doanir's came with lettuce and a dusting of donair meat. We asked for extra sweet sauce and we still had to look for any sauce at all!  The place is under new ownership and clearly they do not know what they are doing!  They couldn't even get the pop order correctly!  It was painful!!"", ""expensive, bad food and service. I have been to other corner bakery cafes, and I usually like them, but I tend to get terrible service at this one. These problems manifests as long waits for meals even during slow times, and getting orders wrong. The last time (never again) I went in it was a slow morning, and it took them 45 minutes to get me my eggs, and when they came they were cold. I informed the cashier that my eggs were cold and I asked him if they could make me new eggs.  He said yes, and took my eggs.  He came back out with my same plate, and it was evident that he microwaved the plate with the toast and fruit on it; the toast was soggy, and fruit warm. I returned my food, and have vowed to never return."", ""I've been here numerous times but last time was seriously the best. The area under my shoulder blade had me near tears for a week.

I have consistently come here for a few years now and the service has never been as bad as it has been the last few times I've been here. Here are my issues:  1) the girl at the front desk never once looked up from her papers while \""\""greeting\""\"" me and asking me what I want. She mumbled under her breath to go pick out a color then yelled across the salon that I was getting a mani and pedi.  2) once I picked out my color I went back to the front and someone who came in after me was seated in a pedi chair, water turned on etc. to get service. Once she saw that I was standing in the front she got a chair going for me. The problem with that is there were no more nail technicians available to work on me. 3) so now I'm sitting in cold water waiting for someone to come and do my feet.  4) the pedicure started, she painstakingly dug into my toes (which I absolutely hate) and rushed through the Massage part of the pedi 5) after it was all said and done, I find out that their prices have gone up!   I used to come here because they have later hours and are open on Sunday's but after a 3rd terrible experience here I am not coming back. In the last 3 months, almost the whole staff has changed and these folks are not meeting my needs."", ""Horrible  experience . We been there yesterday with some friends. Long time waiting, costumer reclaim for food never come to the table,somebody ask  for pizza they just forget including in the order and when they bring to table was no ready.

We choose this place yesterday  but am not recommended  to nobody."", ""My son got a pho and thought it was ok. My daughter got the tofu pad Thai and she said it was horrible. It tasted very bland, with almost no flavor, also, it was super spicy!! All in all, we didn't really like the food here."", ""Sweet little spot on the beach. Not a single thing to complain about. I go for the old school mom n pop beach hotels and this fits the bill. Oh and WTF is corn holing?? I think I'm glad I missed that. Lol."", ""This place is great, they work on other people's work which is convenient if you already have a set. My tech was Divina, and she did a wonderful job with my touch up in a very quick manner.

Also for reference they use Bella lashes, which are one of the best on the market."", ""I definitely won't be coming back here. Long story short, I scheduled an appointment online to have the transmission and differential fluid changed on my pilot. I arrived on time, and I was told it would take approximately 2 hours for completion, I also said I wanted an oil change, but \""\"" full synthetic\""\"". He said it would be $20 more, I said okay. When it was finally done and I was ready to check out, my advisor (Brandon) give me the total cost, which was double than what I expected and paid for in the past. I asked him what was all done, he said, \""\""they completed a transmission flush instead of the regular drain and refill\""\"". I told him that's not what I wanted or asked for. He went on to say \""\""it was good for the car and whatever\""\"", like I'm some kind of idiot. First of all Honda doesn't recommend doing a transmission flush and secondly, its almost triple what you would normally pay for a standard transmission fluid change. On top of that they didn't even do a full synthetic oil change it was just a blend. I didn't have time to argue with him because I was already late for an appointment, but I have the email showing what I originally asked for, so I'll be calling my bank soon."", ""Reviewing the food. Hard to justify $16 for a burger and fries BUT wowow this burger was so delicious. I'm not sure if I was just starving but ordered the Lama burger and the patty size is quality. They also have random ingredients thrown in that you probably haven't seen before like gruyere stuffed in a pepper on your burger. Fries came out nice and crisp vs. soggy and the bun on that burger was great. You order inside by the Nook and then can sit around. They have tons of craft beer to choose from and I could see this place getting packed on the weekends."", ""Worst service of my life!!!!

I came for a wedding weekend and felt that I would have had a better experience at a a Holiday Inn Express down the street.  My hotel room left me feeling absolutely disgusted.  There was hair all over the bathroom, on towels and heaped on the floor.  The headboard had HUGE dust bunnies hanging off the front of it.  The next morning I go to breakfast and the service was clearly that of people motivated to get the back of the house or communal tasks done, but not actually to serve the people.  I was asked and ordered orange juice, only to have to ask a different server 10 minutes later.  This happened multiple times with different members of our group.  Then another table must have requested tabasco sauce, which we had on our table.  The server comes over between two of our members and takes it, there was no \""\""Are you using this?\""\"" or even \""\""Excuse Me.\""\""  They need to find a different way to motivate the staff because it did not meet basic service expectations.  Do not waste your money by staying at this hotel, you will only be disappointed and potentially disgusted."", ""LOVE this tea room and the owners are SUPER SWEET!!!

We immediately had to pay our bills and put our food directly into to-go boxes...which is not awesome when you order the home made fries, and they become soggy on the ride back to work.  My burger was delicious (once I got a break at the office to actually take a bite). The server was pretty unapologetic about the whole situation, and I really felt like we were a huge inconvenience for him.

A coworker and I decided to go to lunch today at a Mexican restaurant that she recommend it. It was my first mind to go somewhere else but I decided to try something new and Yelp something different for a change. Mistake!   Upon entering we saw the sign for the lunch special wish we were both excited about, hey $5.99! We sat down and the waitress seemed friendly. She showed us the lunch menu. I decided to get the taco special and 1 chicken tamale to try (im still seachung for great tamales). Of course like a few other places that I have been too lately, my waitress comes from the kitchen to announce no tamles are ready for today.  Interesting because it's noon and you don't have my ready but you opened at 11am... #ICant  I let it go (and took off a star), getting ready for my  taco lunch with onions and cilantro extra cheese. It came out in due time  only to find out I was not very happy with the food at all. Actually took me a little while to eat my second taco. The positive thing about the meal was the portions. The two tacos were large. It just did not taste like authentic Mexican tacos. It tastes like something that I could easily make at home. American best-try kind-of tacos. Another star gone.   We ready to go soon enough and we ask for separate check which the waiter said that she could do. However she did not bring out separate checks. In fact my coworker had to ask how much her meal was. The waitress had to go back and count up for her total and then come back and tell her how much the her portion was. Well knowing that I only spent about $7 in the restaurant I did not think I needed to do the same. Mistake. I was very surprised when found out my meal was almost $11 when my card was ran. Apparently it was extra for the cilantro onion even know the meal came with tomatoes and lettuce which I asked for instead. Never was told it was extra. I knew I had to pay for extra chees, but dang!  Management came out upon my request to give me a breakdown of the bill, especially since I couldn't get itemized bill. I was not happy, not buying the explaination, nor impressed. They give me a small, change of a refund and vowed to NEVER be back.   No tamales, no detailed bill, no prior knowledge of changes would be extra, food not great at all... Yeah, you have ok decor and yes you smiled but service is lacking, never again. #EpicEpicEpicFail"", ""Easy to get ahold of and things taken care of as a potential tenant... impossible to get things taken care of once papers are signed and they get their money.

But these were, somehow, worse.  Not just dry, but bland.  I couldn't believe that a bakery specializing on just one item could do them so poorly.  And while the woman was not explicitly rude, she certainly wasn't friendly either (not even a smile.)  To Just Cookies, I'll Just say No!"", ""Eek no kidding. There are some positives and I guess I better start with that....The price here is not so bad, there are Chinese restaurants that have crazier prices. Also there have been some good events that occur here and tones of room.  Well and thats pretty much it. The service is not exactly the best, they only come do something when asked to. However they at least do things here...read my other reviews. The building itself is just gross, just GROSS. We saw them put paper in the food. Seriously not only that, there is a stage and there are alot of shitty events, such as old asian people thinking they can sing...really who wants to listen to this crap! Biggest headache of my life. To add insult to injury is get ready for the salties food on earth. Its like the chef have no taste buds and have to salt everything to death.

We decided to walk to have breakfast in Surrey, which we found on Yelp. It was a highly recommended local breakfast place. Located far from the touristy French quarters, it's a small shack-dive beloved by locals and tourists as the best in local cuisine. Even before we got there, we saw a crowd of people waiting outside. The wait for a table was 30 minutes so we felt lucky and elated to sit at the bar. We got a watermelon and jicama salad and a crabmeat omelet. I was disappointment from the first bite. The omelet was soooo rich, like it was made with cream and butter and more butter-cream on top; it made me nauseous. The salad was so plain, it felt like a joke, a few pieces of watermelon on ripped up leaves of bibb lettuce  covered with black pepper. I needed to eat something and asked for a garden salad with a poached egg. It was a poor showing with some mixed greens, a pathetically thin slice of tomato, a few cubes of huge cucumbers used for juicing and a balsamic vinaigrette mixed by finger right in front of me. The place is a tiny shack, should be filled with lovingly prepared local cuisine. It is NOT. The food, as well as the service and the ambiance are a poor showing, more hype than substance. The supposedly organic fresh juices, at $7 a pop, are not squeezed to order but poured from containers from the fridge. Freshly squeezed should be freshly squeezed. They refused to give us water with ice. How can you not give people water when its so unbearable hot outside? We paid more for our breakfast than a top French restaurant in New York and I walked away hungry and disgusted."", ""I posted this 2 days ago and somehow it's not showing...

Went to go on a couple of days later and it wouldn't turn again. They told me they would give me a $243 credit towards a new laptop...fine. I pick up the laptop (that not  all of my things were downloaded into properly), paid another $410.00. over $600 in total. We leave directly from there to go on vacation. At our vacation house, I want to go online and set up and play with the new computer, I couldn't get it to sign on, said the signal strength was too weak. In the mean time, on my old laptop, I'm sitting there watching television shows, my kids are signing on with their laptops, everyone's phone is getting wifi.  I take the laptop back to them, tell I want to return it , it's lousy  First they tell me \""\""I can't return this, you were given multiple discounts on this\""\"" I said no I wasn't , I was given a credit (I paid over $600 for a laptop that costs $380 at Walmart)  Then told \""\""well, we can't resell this because it's used\""\"", and that's my problem??!! Your computer dosen't work, I want to return it. I told them, look, forget the $243, I'll call that a wash, I just want back the $410 I just gave you.

Not even a browned crust. Rice was served \""\""family style \""\"" but do mushy and overlooked. I had a mango margarita that was completely bland and flavorless. We will not be going back. City fish was not good, but this is worse. And so disappointing- the idea of fresh quality Mexican food could have been so good."", ""Mazarro's is fabulous, of course. On my visit yesterday, I was very disappointed they refused to sell me meat cut for braciole. The man at the meat counter said they only order this meat to make their own braciole to sell.

I thought my only solution this go round was to repeat the same overly medicated birth I experienced last time where they told me what to do and I had no say in the matter. I found Rebecca via the web and she came so highly recommended I had to at least speak to her. Her flexibility made me instantly fall in love. She met me via Skype (my request) and was so sweet and knowledgeable I knew she was the doula for me (despite the many others I'd interviewed). From that moment on I've been soaking up her knowledge and leaning on her for support. When I went into labor and couldn't even open my eyes her voice made me so calm Bc she created such a safe soothing space for me, ensuring whispered voices and dimmed lights. She was able to bestow more knowledge on us in that setting than any of the nurses on staff. She is literally a genius when it comes to birth. She has so many tactics and means to provide the best support. She is still my go-to for any mommy concerns. She is always there and always reassuring. Gosh, I love her. She is very affordable and provides so much expertise that I truly don't know why she doesn't charge more. When I had to leave the state for a family emergency within weeks of my due date she found me not just a back-up doula, but also a hospital that does water births. She found me a medical practice that supported my birth choice here in Atlanta. Thanks to her educating me I was able to have the birth I always wanted and didn't know was possible.

I'm truly sad and disappointed with this experience especially since the prices seem higher than the downtown location.  I'll just hold on to my memories but I won't be back."", ""This hotel was so terrible and I can narrow it down to 4 things:  1. The price: Expect to pay a lot of money from the second you arrive. They charge $35 per person for a round trip shuttle ride to the airport. Our room was roughly $275 a night. It's an incredibly large hotel that offers a nail salon, a Godiva Chocolate store, about 9 restaurants and a few bars. But you'll pay dearly for any of those things - like $2.50 for a small bottle of soda. The hotel is designed to keep you in there and they charge you $15 for a round trip shuttle ride to the downtown Nashville area.   2. The service: We called the front desk and were on hold for 20 minutes. We went to the front desk and waited in line for an hour. We waited around to ask the concierge questions. And each time we got, \""\""I don't know\""\"" as the usual response. The cleaning staff was extraordinarily loud and they actually shouted as they went down the hall at 6:30 a.m.  3. The name: They call this place a resort but that is, by far, a misnomer. This place is a convention hotel, period. It's horrifically loud at all hours of the day because they host about 3 conventions at one time. Our windows faced one of the courtyards and there is music pumping there 24 hours a day. The walls are thin and you can hear *everything* happening in the neighboring rooms. (eww!) If you want to relax at a resort, don't stay here because with all those convention people, loud cleaning staff, 24 hour music and thin walls you will only end up with more stress.  4. The size: It's no joke that you will get lost in this hotel. It's inexplicably large. And when it hits noon, you should already be in one of the few restaurants because they fill up FAST. With several conventions happening at one time, getting a \""\""quick bite\""\"" is not possible here. And there's not really any place close by, either. You can walk over to the mall for some fast food but plan enough time for your walk - getting out of the hotel takes at least 5 minutes.  I'm sure glad I was there for a convention and didn't pay out of my own pocket for this ridiculous hotel."", ""Omg! Do not go here for food! I can not stress this enough. I began by ordering a coffee which they did not have brewed. They made a new batch and then informed me that they did not have milk or cream. She later admitted to me that they had milk but it expired a month ago  They proceeded to stir whip cream into my coffee. It was awful and became curd-like within minutes. The pizza was just plain terrible. Cheese wasn't even melted and the dough was still moist. The service was also the worst I've had in Indiana. I literally got a look of disgust when I walked in and the girl was pissed off the entire time I was there. I wouldn't feed my dog from here. Beer only if you come here.""]",3

It was almost 60 bucks for tiny boxes of food."", ""Terrible seating experience. We walked into the restaurant. Half the tables were empty (not exaggerating, I counted). The host said \""\""we are too busy, 35 minute wait\""\"". We put our name down for optionality, and not 7 minutes later we were texted that our table was ready. We arrived at the restaurant and were made to wait another 10 minutes because the host was \""\""busy\""\""."", ""Avoid this place. They require your credit card when you set up an appointment.

Penca is a small restaurant and I knew we would not be able to walk in and get a table, hence the reservation. We showed up and we were told it would be a while, a group was seated at our table.  We waited, and waited.  I had some disagreeable word with the hostess.  We waited some more.  We got two stories - one was none at all just \""\""sorry\""\"", the other was the group came in claimed the table and told the staff they were friends of the owner and they'd cause trouble if removed from the table.  Doesn't matter to me because if the latter is true the owner needs new friends since the current ones will put them out of business, and if the former is just ineptness on the part of staff they'll be out of business.   And so we waited some more.  Given the timing leaving for anything but Subway was not an option. We got seated about 35 minutes late. They comp'd us two drinks for eight people for the wait.

I walked in at 8:30 and, as soon as I got to the counter, the guy said to me \""\""kitchen's closed.\""\"" The grill, fryers, etc were all being covered up.   First of all, if your kitchen is closed, why is the door to your restaurant unlocked?   Secondly, I could see this being the case if I walked in at, say, 9:55PM. But 8:30? That's ridiculous."", ""If I could give zero stars I would. I never ever have had such an experience at an establishment. I came here with a group of 8 for a birthday dinner. We had more than 1 server. I have no idea what any of their names were. They give NO REFILLS on anything (soda, tea, lemonade, etc) which I think is insane! So they recommend buying a pitcher. The pitchers and ice bucket were both in plastic containers you can get from the dollar store.   We wait nearly 2 hours for our food. Majority of our party ordered mac & cheese as a side. Once we got our plates we noticed their was shrimp in our mac & cheese. When we questioned our server, she responded \""\""Oh I thought she told you we ran out\""\"". Mind you, that is completely fine, but what if someone had a seafood allergy?   To top it off, 2 of our party members (birthday girl included) did not receive their meals. They didn't even check back at the table until we flagged them down to report the missing plates. Our server then responded, \""\""I honestly don't even know what you ordered\""\"". We didn't even finish our food and the birthday girl didn't even want to eat them to even bother making her food since we had waited so long and they were closing. We asked to speak to a manager and was told they would come. When they didn't, we asked again. At this time, our \""\""server\""\"" (the same one we asked to get a manager) claimed she was the manager. WHICH WE KNEW WAS A LIE.   I understand they have just opened but theres no way an establishment should be run this way. Our entrees came out on glass plates, but everything else was on paper plates.   I WOULD NOT recommend this establishment to anyone. They didn't apologize or seem interested in good customer service."", ""Really? $45.00 to \""\""hold my rate?\""\"" The trick fees and surprise billing that shows up in my checking account every few months is garbage. The monthly fee doesn't sound so bad, but the surprise fees and the $100.00 fee to cancel the account is somewhat discouraging as well.

I bought a 3k couch which took 12 weeks to build from BoConcept in Philly. The couch had structural problems after 3 months! Customer service was very disorganized and communicated very poorly. I would not buy anything from this company again. Horrible support, high prices and poor quality. STAY AWAY!"", ""I will never eat there again. I ordered chicken Parmesan and after about four bites I realized my chicken was raw!  The manager Gary  said this hardly ever happens. What? Like it was a common occurrence. This place will never last. I ignored a good friends advice saying he had a bad meal there. Next time I will listen."", ""Ok, I hate to give a place one star and I generally don't do it, but after two visits within the past week and both of them being poor, I am left no choice.  On the first visit, an individual in my party (of three people) received their order incorrectly and the kitchen manager was going to fix it.  I believe she then forgot to turn in the order to fix it so everyone was done and the lady still didn't have her corrected order.  Our waitress didn't even return to our table the entire time we were there.  We had to flag down another employee for drink refills.  Second visit... waited...waited...waited... seriously, how long does it take to make a few pizzas, a salad and an app?  Then, we ordered dessert, waited about ten minutes for it.  The employee said \""\""sorry for your wait\""\"" when he brought us the check and then we continued to wait another ten minutes for him to come back and pick it up.  If you are going to acknowledge our wait, you might not want to make us wait again.  Grr!  We were late getting back to our office from our lunch break.  Probably have to say with certainty that I won't be returning to CPK.  Sorry, because the food is actually not that bad but the service could use serious improvements because they are not even that busy of a place!"", ""I was shocked by my stay here.  I came for a wedding weekend and felt that I would have had a better experience at a a Holiday Inn Express down the street.  My hotel room left me feeling absolutely disgusted.  There was hair all over the bathroom, on towels and heaped on the floor.  The headboard had HUGE dust bunnies hanging off the front of it.  The next morning I go to breakfast and the service was clearly that of people motivated to get the back of the house or communal tasks done, but not actually to serve the people.  I was asked and ordered orange juice, only to have to ask a different server 10 minutes later.  This happened multiple times with different members of our group.  Then another table must have requested tabasco sauce, which we had on our table.  The server comes over between two of our members and takes it, there was no \""\""Are you using this?\""\"" or even \""\""Excuse Me.\""\""  They need to find a different way to motivate the staff because it did not meet basic service expectations.  Do not waste your money by staying at this hotel, you will only be disappointed and potentially disgusted."", ""I ordered delivery, food was an hour ad a half late and cold when it arrived. I was told they would be sending a free drink and dessert due to the tardiness, but those items never arrived. When I called to inquire, they said they would remake my order - though since it had been two hours since I originally ordered, I was not surprised nor did I care when that never arrived either. Food, service and punctuality were all terrible. I recommend spending your money elsewhere - this was the worst dining experience I've ever endured."", ""Went because we had a Groupon, wouldnt go back again. Granted there was a large table next to us (8 or 9) but we had put our order in before they sat, took over 20 minutes for our appetizers to come out, drinks were never brought to the table nor was bread. Had to ask for silverware and plates to eat the appetizer. We order their special app which consisted of 3 oysters and 4 clams, which were very fresh. The shrimp cocktail that came out was not.  I ordered their seafood platter which was 3 shrimp flounder and a cluster of crab legs. Would have been better if the crab legs werent water logged, the shell had no crispness to it. I honestly opened each leg by tearing the shell like paper.  My wife ordered the softshell crabs which were delicious, but we couldnt finish them because our dishes were cleared.  Total bill came out to 102.00 not worth the wait or the food"", ""Sorry, I have to say this is the poorest excuse of a restaurant ever.  What is up with the girls wearing stockings under those shorts.  That's nasty.  And do you guys really like when they sit next to you and act like they want to talk.  Oh yeah, I forgot it's every girls dream to sit at a table of fat, chicken wing grease covered, over 40, balding, married guys who may or may not have a pot to piss in.  But you're the same dude that goes to a strip club and thinks the stripper really likes you (dumb ass!!).  This is a joke of a theme restaurant and I am embarrassed to be a human when I see them do that hula hoop act in the middle of the bar.  I've been to Hooters twice and I don't plan on ever going again.  I guess it's okay if you just want some beer and wings but aren't there plenty of local bars that do that part better and with more dignity?  Even strip bars have more dignity.

Today, we called to request an ETA an hour after delivery and were told the deliveryman would leave in five minutes.  Half an hour later, we called again and were put on hold twice.  When I said I'd been waiting an hour and a half, the person on the other end of the phone gave a sarcastic remark, so I told him to cancel the order.  The deliveryman showed up half an hour after that, and I turned him away.  I will definitely never order from this Pizza Hut again."", ""Not Authentic Indian.. its more like the american chinese restaurants!!! Biggest Pet Peeve was the Biryani.. the rice was undercooked and chicken tasted like it was borrowed from another curry...   Also the server was extremely intrusive."", ""I'm laughing at all the decent reviews for this place making fun of all the low star reviewers telling us this is Kmart and not Nordstrom. First off, last time I checked, Nordstrom does not sell toilet bowl cleaner, tissue paper, laundry detergent, etc. So you should come up with a better argument. No matter which way you look at it, this Kmart is the absolute worst. They never have anything in stock, the customer service is a joke, it's filthy, it's outdated, it's overpriced for a Kmart (I can drive down to Target in Ventura and get everything at least two dollars cheaper), and filled with absolutely unnecessary things. The only reason this Kmart is the second most successful in the country is because it is the ONLY option in the Goleta/Santa Barbara area and because kids moving to isla vista who need all new furniture and supplies do not know any better when they first move to the area. No one in their right mind should give this place more than one star. I am so EMBARRASSED and DISGUSTED that this is our only option in Santa Barbara. Someone PLEASE start a petition for Target.

In the lyrics, it stated, \""\""One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do\""\"". That may be true in love, but when it comes to dining sometimes you just want to dine alone.  If you do, avoid HWK.   Not once, but twice I have been turned  away when wanting to dine here as a single person. The first time when I called to make a reservation, the young lady who answered informed me they preferred not to sit single diners at tables and that I'd have to eat at the bar.  At first I was content with that arrangement, but then she continued to tell me that  those eating at the bar can not select from the entire menu. At that point, I decided not to make the reservation.  I wanted the true HWK experience. After all the reviews have been amazing.   The second time, I stopped in for early lunch while shopping the main drag in Maplewood.  Once again, I was told I'd have to sit at the bar and order from a \""\""limited menu\""\"". When I asked if I could be seated at one of the hightops in the window, she told me she needed to save those for parties of two. The kicker came when I asked if they were already reserved and she said, \""\""no\""\"".  I ate else where that day.   What I do not understand, is why can I go to Chicago dine at such top restaurants such as; Girl and the Goat, RL, The Pump Room, Table Fifty-Two, The Purple Pig, Frontera Grill and The Publican and be welcomed with open arms. Many of the chefs at these restaurants have been on Top Chef and published cookbooks.  How is it that their establishments are welcoming to the lone diner, yet a small Maplewood restaurant is not?  I understand they have a small space, but if you are going to sit single diners at the bar, let them order from the entire menu. Before posting, I shared this review with other friends who are single diners and being women, they said for them they would not feel comfortable eating at the bar and would not eat here if a table was not an option.   Disclaimer: I did dine here as a couple opening week and was not impressed. I contributed that to opening week jitters and wanted to give them another chance.

I ordered breakfast (I know lol) from them about a month ago, and received pancakes that were drenched in some weird butter substance and home fries that were rock hard. I spoke to a man named Tommy, who offered all kinds of excuses about the food before finally offering me a credit.   Fast forward to this morning. I decided to give them another chance because I was hungry and had a credit. I call and am greeted by a young woman who informed me that I had two people waiting before me and asked me to hold. She proceeded to place me on hold before I could even respond. I held for about 3 minutes before she picked up. I placed my order and then explained that I had a credit. She stated she would need to look in \""\""the book\""\"" for my credit. Another two minutes of waiting and surprise, she can't locate my credit. I ask to speak to a manager, and she says that the manager is out doing deliveries. Seriously...wth? She tells me I can call back later. Umm no, I'm hungry now.  I ended up canceling my order. This place is beyond ratchet and I will never order from them again. The food at Bruno's and Bally's is much better...so is their level of cleanliness and customer service."", ""Let me start with the positives. This little restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside, but it's very cute and quaint on the inside. Our server was polite and friendly. He kept the soda refills coming, and did a good job overall. However, this is where the praise ends.  I went to this restaurant because I was in the area and wanted some Italian food. I saw the four star average reviews and figured it would be tasty. Be warned. It is WAY overpriced, and the food wasn't even good. The mozzarella sticks looked and tasted like the frozen ones you buy at the grocery store. They were $7.99 for five small sticks. Not worth it. Then came the entrees. Everything on the menu had cute names and sounded delicious. My husband ordered Chicken Parm, and I had the Baked Ziti. It was awful. I mean... not good at all. His chicken was \""\""ok,\""\"" but not crispy on the outside like parm should be. Mine didn't have the brown, bubbly, cheesy top you'd normally see on baked ziti. The mozzarella cheese was barely even melted. The sauce tasted like it came from a jar. It was weak and not very flavorful. I had about five bites and didn't even take my leftovers home for the kids.   Save your money and go to Olive Garden instead. I like to support local businesses, but this was an unpleasant dining experience. Let me say again, it was ridiculously expensive and the food was just BAD. I seriously left there wishing I'd gone to McDonald's instead."", ""The next morning we were up early, filled with expectations of the new adventures in New Orleans. We decided to walk to have breakfast in Surrey, which we found on Yelp. It was a highly recommended local breakfast place. Located far from the touristy French quarters, it's a small shack-dive beloved by locals and tourists as the best in local cuisine. Even before we got there, we saw a crowd of people waiting outside. The wait for a table was 30 minutes so we felt lucky and elated to sit at the bar. We got a watermelon and jicama salad and a crabmeat omelet. I was disappointment from the first bite. The omelet was soooo rich, like it was made with cream and butter and more butter-cream on top; it made me nauseous. The salad was so plain, it felt like a joke, a few pieces of watermelon on ripped up leaves of bibb lettuce  covered with black pepper. I needed to eat something and asked for a garden salad with a poached egg. It was a poor showing with some mixed greens, a pathetically thin slice of tomato, a few cubes of huge cucumbers used for juicing and a balsamic vinaigrette mixed by finger right in front of me. The place is a tiny shack, should be filled with lovingly prepared local cuisine. It is NOT. The food, as well as the service and the ambiance are a poor showing, more hype than substance. The supposedly organic fresh juices, at $7 a pop, are not squeezed to order but poured from containers from the fridge. Freshly squeezed should be freshly squeezed. They refused to give us water with ice. How can you not give people water when its so unbearable hot outside? We paid more for our breakfast than a top French restaurant in New York and I walked away hungry and disgusted."", ""do not come here unless you want to get lied to and ripped off!! the guy tells me $92 for my tire installed then gives me a bill for $130. he slides me a $ 10 bill and tells me this is my rebate. this place is shady and i would not recommend it to anyone who is looking to deal with people with integrity. thanks for ripping me off keystone!!"", ""This is the worst Hertz location. I rent a car once or twice a week for work and have been to a lot of Hertz locations. The customer service is poor, the car pick up location is inconvenient and the cars never have a full tank of gas.

I have never rented a car from this location with a full tank of gas. They tell you it has a \""\""little less than full\""\"". How the heck do you return a car \""\""a little less than full\""\""? I always end up filling up the tank for them because I don't know when to stop pumping.  3. The cars used to be in the downstairs garage of 30th St station. Not anymore.  Go out the rental office and make a right, up the ramp until you find the escalator. Take escalator up. Walk across the overpass and take the escalators down. Leave the building and cross the walkway to the rental cars, which are outdoors. So, if it is raining or snowing, good luck. 4. Take parking ticket from lesson 1 to exit the parking area. 5. Upon return, just park in any spot and bring your keys back to the rental counter (back into the building, up the escalator, across the overpass, down the escalator, across the length of the station) to return the keys.

No excuse for such unprofessional service. Shame, shame, shame."", ""Super excited to try this place while in town for 24 hours. We sat at the small 12 person bar and it took awhile for someone to take our drink order as there was only one bartender on a Saturday night. About 5-6 servers did say hi to us though. Drinks were fine. Apps came out which was the shrimp cocktail and meatballs. Meatballs were under cooked shrimp cocktail was fine. I ordered the chefs cut 20oz bone in ribeye with a chili rub and the wife ordered the filet with one of their toppings of cheese and peppers. The ribeye came out on a cold plate so I sent it back and the manager came over and apologized profusely. The best thing about the wife's filet was the cheese on top. She ordered it med rare and it came out slightly above rare. My steak came back out. I always order mine rare at steak houses and this was like a soggy sponge. Literally couldn't swallow more then 3 bites. The actual cut of steak was one of the worst cuts I've ever seen. The steak was bland. I had to ask multiple times what the rub was because I couldn't taste anything not even salt or pepper.  The beans that came out with the steaks were under cooked and hard. Needless to say I actually didn't eat dinner. The server came and picked up my full plate of steak and threw it away. The chefs cut was 50 bucks. And the total bill was 150 I literally spend that much at least once a week on food so that's not a big deal.  But I would rather spend 150 bucks on double quarter pounders with cheese and have to eat them all in one sitting then eat anything at this place again.  From start to finish it was horrible."", ""My boyfriend and I were looking for some good Mexican food for his birthday, and since I missed the boat on getting a reservation at El Vez I figured we would give this a try. The reviews seemed okay and everyone said that the drinks were really good.   Not at all true....  To start with, we ordered the guacamole. I have had a lot of different kinds and make it myself at home, and this was incredibly bland with not a lot of flavor.  I ordered the Carnitas Tacos and my boyfriend got the Brisket Tacos (special of the day). They were all right, but the waiter told us right off the bat he would recommend a side since they were small portions.  We didn't end up eating any of our side since they were so big, we each only finished two tacos!   The most disappointing part of this whole experience was the drinks.  I got the Classic Mojito (which I have also had and made many times before) and he got the Mexican style Mojito, that apparently is with cilantro and tequilla instead of rum and mint.  The first batch were really delicious, so we ordered another round. Not at ALL the same drink.  They looked very different, but mainly they didn't taste at all similar.  Very very sweet and acidic, way too bitter.  We politely called the waiter over and asked if the bartender wouldn't mind remaking them since the first drinks we had were very different, and he obliged. A few seconds later the bartender came back and told us she remade the drinks but tasted them and they tasted exactly how they should be.  She was very condescending and rude (My boyfriend and I have both worked in customer service before...when customers are being polite in their complaints, there is no need to be rude back) and said she would make the drink for us 10 times if we wanted but it wouldn't be any different. She said that they first AMAZING drink we had must have been made wrong.  She kept asking us how they were different and we had trouble explaining to her exactly what to change, so we decided to let it go and asked for the check. Yes, we still got charged for the shitty drinks that we left on our table.   For a tequilla bar who is apparently known for their drinks, the inconsistency is frightening.  I was very disappointed in the entire experience, not what I was planning for the first birthday that my boyfriend and I spent together."", ""I can't say enough about the shop - clean, friendly and professional.

Granted there was a large table next to us (8 or 9) but we had put our order in before they sat, took over 20 minutes for our appetizers to come out, drinks were never brought to the table nor was bread. Had to ask for silverware and plates to eat the appetizer. We order their special app which consisted of 3 oysters and 4 clams, which were very fresh. The shrimp cocktail that came out was not.  I ordered their seafood platter which was 3 shrimp flounder and a cluster of crab legs. Would have been better if the crab legs werent water logged, the shell had no crispness to it. I honestly opened each leg by tearing the shell like paper.  My wife ordered the softshell crabs which were delicious, but we couldnt finish them because our dishes were cleared.

I went to NY Pizza after a Mardi Gras parade last week. (Price gouge much?) The woman at the counter presented us with two options for individual slices: pepperoni and spinach. We asked why we couldn't see any green on top of the spinach pizza and she told us \""\""The spinach is under the crust\""\"" (spoiler alert: there was no spinach!). The service was prompt, despite them being busy, and we paid and left. Within ten steps of leaving the front door, the cheese on the \""\""spinach\""\"" slice slid off the bread and fell to the ground. Granted, I think this is probably in part due to the pizza-holder, but cheese should never slide off a pizza that easily. What a waste of $4. I won't be back."", ""Wish I could give 0 stars! We went with a lot of clothes in hand and while they were going through them, we looked around the store. They lied to us and said they wouldn't take clothes that were more than 18 months out of style/trend! Jeans and T-Shirts are NEVER out of trend.  They didn't buy anything from us and they were sending everyone who came in to sell their clothes away without buying anything from anyone because they were too lazy and didn't want to do work."", ""Just visited Station 52 today for lunch and was disappointed.  Food was mediocre at best. The nachos were a joke, the salsa is not fresh, all food seems to be frozen and reheated. They display specials on a blackboard as you enter but fail to mention they are only valid at the bar. Found this out once we received the bill. My wife ordered the Greek chicken pita which comes with fries and she asked to have old bay fries instead of standard fries. We get the bill and they charged us for a basket of old bay fries and when questioned why the charge for a basket, they said the Greek Pita came with chips but we didn't even get the chips.  The waitress then says \""\""oh I thought you wanted to sub fries for the chips\""\"" then why did we get charged the full amount for the basket of fries, there should have been some discount if it was a sub. The waitress completely forgot my drink refill and brought it out with the check about 10-15 minutes after she took my glass. Overall very bad experience, won't be back."", ""Casinos are just lame.

Otherwise...I would skip it."", ""Ridiculous prices for small portions/little meat/mostly rice."", ""Went here with some coworkers and were awkwardly informed that we couldn't split the check beyond 3 checks. Also, when asked when lunch ends, the waiter couldn't even say a time, just that it had ended.   The waiter made 6 people write down their orders on a blank piece of paper. When he would bring us a beverage or plate, he would only acknowledge one person at a time- take an order, process, return.  Never did he address the table as a group to ask if we had any more requests.   At the end, I took it upon myself to split the check based on each persons order to determine how much we individually owed. After 10 min, the waiter impatiently said that he can now split it up into different checks. I had just finished and asked him to charge each card based on my calculations, even going so far as to writing down the last 4 digits of each card to be associated win each amount. He returned with individual receipts that were wrong. Each person was charged the wrong amount, and when added up, was different than the original total!

The salon looks lovely, and would have been much more pleasing if the receptionist had smiled, or offered a welcome. Neither were given. Though my hairdresser was polite, there was no genuine friendliness. The cut turned out OK, but not jaw dropping. I won't be harsh about the cut because I mentioned I didn't want to cut it too short because I'd like to keep it long for my wedding which is in October. She had asked if there was anything I was looking for and I replied with 'just a trim, unless you have suggestions'. She had no suggestions which I usually mark as characteristic of a hairdresser that either isn't creative or doesn't enjoy their job. I let it go though, and thought I'd wait till after my hair was dried before making my final judgment. The Blow out was horrible, even I could have done a better job than she did. I usually love the blow outs I get after my hair is cut because the hair is smooth and full of body. My hair was flat and boring. I had considered having her do my hair for my wedding but decided that if she couldn't do a decent blow dry she probably couldn't do an up do.  Once the cut was completed she took me to the front to check out. When I told the receptionist I had an appointment for make up she said 'Oh. Well, I don't see it and there isn't anyone here to do it. Do you want to make an appointment for another day'? When I scheduled the appointments I confirmed that I wanted both, and when I told there wouldn't be a problem I assumed both were booked. I had even told the woman booking the appointments that I live out of STATE and am only up on some weekends. I will not rebook any appointments with Ame, fearing that I would make a three hour trek to be told 'sorry- it didn't make it on the books'. Not worth the visit- unfriendly staff, poor service, and unreliable scheduling make this salon the worst I have ever visited! I'll be finding another salon once my move to PA is final.""]",11

These were so gross. When they arrived on our table, they were soaked with some kind of weird brown juice. I assume it was the oil they were fried in that looked like it was last changed prior to the Exxon-Valdez oil spill back in '89. Horrible, burnt, greasy, and very \""\""off\""\"" flavor. Our table mate next to us ordered the ravioli bites, they were also covered in the brown oil grease and they didn't even eat 1/2 of them.  Our pasta dishes were equally as disappointing and gross. I opted for the lasagna, and it was NASTY. The pasta itself was overcooked, which I can live with if bolstered by a decent sauce, quality/fresh meat, and good cheese. This lasagna offered NONE of these things. The sauce was the worst offender. Packed with sugar, it was a VERY SWEET, very thin red/marinara sauce. There were no spices or typical Italian seasonings, no garlic, no onion flavor, none of the deep, rich flavors that typically adorn good Italian-style food. The cheese was cheap and rubbery, and there was NO MEAT in the lasagna to speak of. Literally, I had NONE in my dish. It was absent, and sorely needed.  DO NOT EAT HERE.

I work nearby so I have ordered here many times. I recently learned that there was an online ordering option, which I thought would be perfect because I am busy throughout the entire day with appointments and don't have a lot of time to wait and order at Cosi, especially during their busy hours.  A couple times I have online ordered there were no issues. My food was ready when it was supposed to be, and I was able to avoid the long lines. The other times, the service was horrible. When you online order, the estimated wait is always 20 minutes. I always give Cosi 25-30 minutes to make sure everything is ready so I can just pick it up after prepaying online. A few times I have had to wait 50 minutes total from when I online ordered because the employees did not look at the online orders as they were coming in to prepare them. My question is, what is the point of online ordering if it takes longer to get your food when you online order than when you walk in?  Today I online ordered from Cosi. Not only was my order not ready after 30 minutes, but the service was horrible and the employees were incompetent. I went through the normal line and told the employees I online ordered. The employee, without checking my online order receipt that they should have already looked at, asked me what I got because they clearly had not made my order yet. I was ordering for multiple people so I told him I couldn't remember, so he went in the back to get my order receipt which is what he should've done earlier. I ordered coffees so I went to the coffee counter while I was waiting for my order to be prepared. There was an employee busy preparing someone else's order so I stood there waiting. An employee from another register asked if she could help me. I told her that I had 2 coffees with my online order. She then said okay and just STOOD THERE. I had to ask her, \""\""So should I just go back to the register I was just at and wait for someone to help me with my coffee?\""\"" She said yes as she continued to stand there not doing anything. So I went back to the original register I was at and the woman who was still busy preparing an order asked me what I needed. I told her that I ordered 2 coffees. She then asked the employee who I had just talked to and was not doing anything to prepare the 2 coffees! The employee who was now helping me did not understand the coffee sizes. The coffee sizes online are grande and gigante, and she didn't know what those meant. Don't use those coffee size names if your employees don't even know what they mean. In the meantime, the person who was preparing my food order had to come ask me again what I ordered while showing me my order receipt. He clearly did not know how to read the order receipt, which honestly a 1st grader could understand. He asked me if I ordered 2 squagels, and I said yeah that's what the online receipt you are showing me says.

Love that I can check in online before getting to to hotel and just use the express kiosk when I get there to get my room keys and avoid the long line,  LOVE THAT! The rooms are always nice and clean and comfortable. The last 2 rooms I have stayed in had views of the pool which was nice!  The pool is very nice and relaxing and never too crowded. The spa Toscana is very nice but a bit pricey. None of the restaurants I have tried there so far have been great but I haven't tried to steakhouse or Chi yet, so I haven't had the full experience yet. The slots are never too crowded when I go and can usually get on the machines I like to play with little to no delay.  I enjoy visiting here.

It's the tour guides at the plantation that are So Great!   This company has POOR time management issue!   After being picked up, we waited for about 20min to wait for the other bus to come then about 20 people were transferred to our bus. By the time we really started the tour, it was an hour after the pick up time.   Payment issue - I called about the discount I'll get if I reserve online. The woman told me to do it otherwise I can't get it when paying in person. So I did it. But, then the driver, half way into the tour, said now everyone please line up to pay. He used a tiny portable credit card machine to process everyone's card. It was slow  SLOW! The bus was full that day and it was 90 degrees out. It took him about 45min to get everything done plus he was confused about two groups of people who happened to have the same last name.   Really? It's 2013 people! The company can't take payment online or over the phone?  Why ask your customer to waste valuable time?   Though I had the email proving I've paid online. I was told that it simply reserved my seats and wasn't the actual payment. So paid AGAIN and of course got charged TWICE! It has been over a week and I haven't got the refund.   Because of this delay, when we got to the second plantation, we had about a little over an hour left because the driver said we  must leave at 5.    He told us to go straight to the big house but gave us the WRONG time when the tour would start. So everyone waited about 15 minutes in line AGAIN instead of just enjoying the beautiful garden at Oak Alley. (The tour is boring and the stories aren't interesting. I'd recommend people just spend all the time in the garden) By the time we came out, it was almost time to get on the bus and head back to the French Quarter. So Disapppinting. We didn't get to visit the beautiful Oak Alley at all.    Give me my money back, Cajun Encounter!"", ""Stopped in for dinner alone while taking a break from work.

I don\\'t understand why Ashley would not give us her first name unless she was concerned about something.

The manager was probably the worst of the experience.

It's also not that expensive - only about $10 /platter and it comes with two sides and cornbread... and if you don't like cornbread you can swap it for another side.

I would definitely order it again.   The one catch: it is pretty expensive. Probably place you would go to for an especially fun or nice meal, but might not be able to afford each week.   The decor is cozy and up-scale, with small round tables surrounded by tall couches to sit on. You can hang up your coat when you enter the door, and the hostess stands behind a large wooden whiskey barrel.

Overall the hotel gets 5 stars, their restaurants would be a bit lower (more on them below).  My room was great-  very new, quiet, nice linens, very comfy mattress, great shower/tub and amenities. I had a city view room which was awesome.  But even the other side is nice with views of the White River.  See pics.  Hotel is only 9 months old I think.  Only thing that would have made it even better would be a fridge and microwave.    If you're going to a convention or a game the location is awesome.  It's connected to the convention center, which is connected to Lucas Oil Stadium, several other hotels, and the mall downtown.  You don't even have to go outside, which is great in bad weather.  Also walking distance to the minor league stadium, all museums, downtown, movie theatre, White River state park, and the zoo.  The staff was so helpful, polite, always smiling and friendly. There are 3 restaurants and a central bar.  High Velocity is a sports bar with tons of TVs, every major sporting even was on.  Food was just so so but service was excellent.  Osteria Pronto is Italian.  Not the best ever but pretty good, had their minestrone soup twice it was so good, and the gnocchi was pretty good. You can have a drink at the central bar area and order take out from Osteria Pronto.  That was a nice option to room service.  I didn't try the last place.    Had room service breakfast one day and it was awesome.  The fresh fruit plate was huge and delicious. 3 kinds of berries, two kinds of melons, pineapple, grapes, and yogurt.    Starbucks on the second floor next to the walkway to the convention center.  I did a lot of walking and dining in other hotels.  From what I see the JW is the newest and nicest.

No matter which way you look at it, this Kmart is the absolute worst. They never have anything in stock, the customer service is a joke, it's filthy, it's outdated, it's overpriced for a Kmart (I can drive down to Target in Ventura and get everything at least two dollars cheaper), and filled with absolutely unnecessary things.

I had a pita with tempura fried quinoa that was good, but dry without any tzatziki. I also had the green beans which were way too oily and I couldn't finish them.    The next day I went back in for food again and realized virtually nothing in the window had changed except there was less vegetable lasagna. This really concerned me as it was now 11:50 am and I didn't think a lot of people would have eaten it already. I then realized that probably none of this stuff was cooked very fresh and it was oily as a way to preserve it.   I got the vietnamese tofu sandwich with whole grain. They nuked it in a microwave and I had to wait five minutes for it to cool down. The bread was really dry and hard and flavorless. The tofu had no remarkable flavor, and the carrots were seemingly doused with chili to make the flavor of the whole thing. I couldn't eat the sandwich and ended up eating the tofu out of it and going to Joe for a croissant after to be full enough to wait for dinner.  The employee there was really not wanting to help in any way shape or form. She looked at me annoyed when I asked for a cup of water.  I paid cash which she looked at me annoying because she didn't get to just swipe a card and then when I had change of 1.09 she used one hand and slowly took out nine pennies using one hand acting like she couldn't even use the other hand because she didn't want to wash it again to go back to preparing food. When I asked if I could instead have a nickel and four pennies, she just looked at me and said \""\""no.\""\""  This was pretty ridiculous as the register had about 15 nickels in it and she just didn't want to be helpful.

The restaurant was completely empty.  We inquired if they were even open and a nice lady said they were and proceeded to seat us.   Their menu did not offer as many options of meat types or dishes as most Mexican restaurants do here in Indianapolis.  My husband ordered a margarita and the special of the day, Chilaquilles con salsa verde y pollo at $6.99 and I ordered a carne asada burrito at $7.99 and water to drink. Chips and salsa were brought to the table.  Chips were  fried there, and while I like that style of chip (thin, often bubbles into thin layers) but were cold and very greasy.  Salsa was sweet but had some heat in the finish.  It was easy to eat a lot of those! When our meals came to the table, frankly, they were underwhelming.  My burrito tortilla looked/felt like it was not heated at all and cutting into my burrito was disappointing.  There was lots of lettuce and tomato, a scoop of a white rice (not spanish rice) and there was supposed to be mozzarella cheese in it but couldn't taste or see it.  The carne asada was thinner than a strip of bacon.  Unfortunately, I would be generous in saying there was maybe 2 ounces of beef.  In all honesty, there was no more meat in it than two strips of bacon, diced.  My husband mentioned it to the person (owner) with a quick \""\""sorry\""\"" muttered and no offer to do anything.   While the combination of ingredients was not improperly prepared, there are 100 other Mexican restaurants in town I can spend $8.00 on a burrito and it would be generously filled with meat. As for my husband's chilaquilles, I order this all the time from Biscuits in Broad Ripple and this was another disappointment.  This was chips, salsa verde, one fried egg and a very thin boneless piece of grilled chicken.  My husband felt as I did.  Not poorly prepared but completely lacking any substance.  During the time we spent in this restaurant, there was not one other customer coming or going.  With the lack of substance to the food, I suspect most people will feel as I did and would not waste their time coming back here.  There is no way this restaurant can survive when prices are the same as other Mexican restaurants but quality is far less.  Sadly, I was even mad that we spent $25.00 at this place and left just to drive to a fast food restaurant so we could get some quick, cheap protein.   I will chalk this up to a learning experience.

Terrible."", ""I find it hard to believe there are so many people with such low standards when it comes to the Daily Bread.  It is a ripoff of St. Louis Bread Co/Panera Bread, which in of itself I don't mind at all.  I have eaten multiple times at the Daily Bread and have yet to have an enjoyable experience.  The food is so-so at best.  Their sandwiches are basic and lack any real flavor.  I also tried the BBQ Chicken pizza and it was okay.    I certainly wouldn't steer anyone away from this place based on the food.  The food is basic and simple, not bad but also nothing great.  My biggest qualm with the Daily Bread is the service.  The majority of the workers seem utterly uninterested in helping out.  There was a line of about 6 people and one person at the register.  There was no sense of urgency to help any of the customers in line.  We waited for a good 5-6 minutes to put an order in.  After receiving our cups to get our drinks we looked for a clean place to sit and eventually settled on a table top that was the least dirty of the tables available.  There were plenty of open spots but it just appeared as though there was lots of trash left behind.  Does anyone bus these tables?  I anticipate that people are responsible for cleaning up after themselves, but it appeared as though the tables hadn't been effectively cleaned in a while.  There was also some trash on the floor that hadn't been addressed as well.  The order number was called and the order was only halfway completed.  When we asked which sandwich was ours, we were basically ignored as the girl put up two more orders.   After another few minutes the rest of the order came up and we began to eat.  I tried both items and as I stated before, both were okay.  The problem is that the food was just unable to make up for the lack of organization, the slow speed at which we were served, or the cleanliness of the restaurant.  After 3 attempts, I'm writing the Daily Bread off and won't return.  I'd rather go to St. Louis Bread Co, get the same level of food, but in a clean environment and a timely setting."", ""Got the special--mole chicken.  Terrible. I can't say enough bad things about it.

Sad thing is that it used to be so good. :("", ""After joining Yelp and reading the reviews for Lilly Nails, as well as reviewing their Facebook page,  I eagerly went for a pedicure and a mani polish change. Unfortunately, I was beyond disappointed as I was looking forward to quality work and an above average experience based on what I interpteted was a place that takes pride in their work.  The technician seemed annoyed when I asked to have the water a bit hotter.  I got the deluxe pedicure which I asked about prior to getting to ensure that more time would be spent on callus removal, however she spent about 30 seconds pumicing one foot and less than 20 seconds on the other foot missing a whole area on the bottom of my second foot.  She rushed the service and my pedicure and polish change together were at most 40 minutes.  When I go for a pedicure, particularly if I pay extra for what is considered a \""\""deluxe\""\"" service, I expect the work and the experience as a whole to be above average.

After reading the glowing reviews of other diners we had high hopes...but after our mediocre meal I thought maybe we had stumbled into the wrong place.

I waited several weeks to try again, even worse!! We came for a show with a band and sat at a high top table by the bar. Nobody came by to say hi or ask about drinks. We waited 15 minutes and still not service, I get it, it's busy. So I go to the bar. The bartender is busy with other guest, she says she will be right with me, 15 mins later still haven't been helped. The manager is very present and visible the whole time.  He is yelling at servers and comparing about not doing their jobs. But he doesn't even notice that I have not been helped yet. Finally another bartender helps me and I walk my drinks back to my party. Still nobody has come by our table. We were there for a while and no server has come by and the manager was very oblivious to our distaste or the fact we needed help. On top of that, there was crazy feedback on the music and you couldn't even hear the singing. We finished our beers and went elsewhere. Very disappointing."", ""No idea why this place is so highly-favoured by other people - I've had loads of great, authentic and inexpensive Japanese food at other places before and this place simply disappoints. $23 for a lunch box set consisting of a few measly pieces of chicken smothered in cloying teriyaki sauce, disappointing tempura that wasn't even very cripsy at all, and spicy tuna rolls that were only so-so. If you really want good Japanese food, look elsewhere, this place has a posh interior and posh people frequent it but evidently they haven't got good taste for Japanese food."", ""I really want to like this place; they have a really cool concept with interesting drinks; however the excitement stops there. But because of the service, and the environment the rude bartenders create, I will never go back. I went recently with a group of girls celebrating a bachelorette party. This was at the beginning of the night, none of us were drunk, we're all a little bit older, so we were very quiet and tame, as far as groups of girls go.   The bartenders were nothing but rude to all of us. I hate nothing more than an entitled bartender. You're in the service industry... in the quarter... Anyway, the bride to be wanted a picture at each bar she went to, and we asked the bartender in a nearly empty bar if he could either take a picture or be in the picture, and his responses were beyond rude.   Also, my friend asked for change for a $20, and the bartender completely forgot, and made her sit and wait for 15 minutes while he did other things. My friend just patiently waited. and when the bartender realized he forgot, he wasn't even apologetic.   Don't waste your money on this place, go to Latitude 29 where the bartenders are nice and accommodating, the drinks are better at Latitude anyway in my opinion."", ""--------DINNER REVIEW----------  I rarely write reviews, but this honestly was one of the worst group dining experiences I've ever had. It was objectively a horrible experience, even without comparing it to the hype it receives, and ruined what was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner celebration.   We had a group of 8 that had a reservation made well in advance. Short wait, but not too bad. Keep in mind, it seemed like a normal Friday night, but weren't super busy or at-capacity.  It was a birthday dinner, so I told the hostesses that it was her birthday, and asked if they could bring out something for her at the end of the meal, which was acknowledged. Pretty standard stuff, whether at a Applebee's or the French Laundry. We were sat at a booth right next to the Maitre D' stand, and next to all the wait staff's home base, so pretty much no excuse for not getting any attention.   After getting us waters, it took them a LONG time to even come by and acknowledge us. After ordering wine, it took them another good 15-20 minutes to even bring us our wine, and no one even checked in on us! (hint: if you're running a restaurant, wine is your profit center and doesn't take any work other than taking a bottle off a shelf and opening it. bring it out ASAP...).   After ordering food, it was more of the same...a long wait for food to start coming out and no one checking in on us AT ALL. We drank the bottles we ordered and had to get up and flag someone down to get another wine order. A couple of us even got up during the meal to remind them to bring out something for birthday girl at the end of the meal.   Once our meal was done and taken away, we were given dessert menus and the server disappeared for 10-15 minutes... AGAIN. After coming back, he asked what dessert we wanted, so we ordered some coffees... and waited... and waited. Eventually we got up and asked him what was going on and if they were going to bring anything out like we asked multiple times.   They finally brought out a couple of cookies with a candle...  In summary, the food was pretty hit or miss, pretty mediocre for this price point. Whipped feta, like other reviews have said, was amazing, and the Braised Lamb was really good. But the Sirloin was chewy and bland and the Grilled Caesar tasted like a soggy, luke-warm, wilted mess (two orders were left untouched by a group of 8). Atmosphere was nice and trendy. But the service, which is a huge reason to spend your hard-earned $ at a restaurant, was absolutely horrendous.   I really love going to cool, popular restaurants and having a great time, and I hate writing such a negative review, but I had to share my experience, especially for a restaurant that is getting an awful lot of (undeserved) hype."", ""Sorry we cannot rate NO STARS...made reservation 24 hrs in advance with Open Table app...arrived for dinner 15 minutes early only to find restaurant was \""\""closed for private party\""\""...staff member who was not at all sympathetic told has they tried to call everyone that morning...had no missed calls on phone or message from Open Table app...never again Ole Red...Big Blake really disappointed us."", ""One out of three dishes was good.

She was very friendly, and she's an amazing local chef.   Parking is kind of crummy, but we ended up always getting a spot.

The current kitchen staff executes the current menu rather badly. Chipotle shrimp tacos were bland and missing ingredients promised on the menu. At breakfast at least the waiter (one he showed up at breakfast) was honest in admitting that the salmon was no longer house-smoked as the menu says. Respect your customers enough not to lie to them on an easily corrected paper menu. Corned beef hash was more like chili, swimming in a sea of greasy broth in a bowl.

She was doing great until Thursday, when we noticed her getting a little slow and not wanting to eat.  We decided friday when we both got home from work, to take her in.  This place was the closest and recommend by our vet clinic for emergency service.  They wanted to do a series of test and x-rays.  I was fine with the blood work but really wasn't excited about dosing our poor little girl with radiation for the x-rays.  The Vet told me it was necessary.  So we sucked up the $650 charge and had the work done.    At this time the Vet said there was not an elevated white cell count and that the dog was not dehydrated.  I asked about maybe a course of nursing friendly antibiotics. The vet recommended that we do immediate surgery to extract her uterus.  We did plan on having the dog spayed but this was a big shock.  The poor little dog just had puppies, was nursing and now they wanted to fillet her open! WTF?! How could they possibly think this was a good idea.  Not only that, it was getting a little annoying how every time they recommended something, they would step out and come back with a piece of paper stating they wanted your next paycheck up front.  So we declined the $3,000 emergency surgery, paid our $650 bill and left with a course of antibiotics.  Our little dog is doing just fine.  She had a mild infection but kicked it. Glad we have enough education and experience to have made the most conservative and preservative decision of our dog.    And I won't even get into the story about when we saw the $3000 estimate for surgery and the Vet said that if it was not affordable, some people do choose to euthanize.  I grew up on a ranch, I work emergency medicine, and understand the circle of life, but this place just plain baffled me.  It seemed more like a place that wanted to ring you dry for cash rather than try to help you make the right decision for you and your animal.  We told our regular vet about our experience and she was even pretty taken back about the price of everything.   Will we not return."", ""Terrible service under new ownership.

Either get here early, or don't bother trying at all. If there are no parking spots, that should be the first indication that inside is cramped AF and OVERFLOWING with people. If there is a line outside extending so far back that you could see it as you approach the entrance, I'm sorry but no. To validate what you will probably be thinking, no, it won't be worth it. There were no lockers upon entry which is understandable, but either make enough lockers so that it could accommodate the maximum capacity, or SET a maximum capacity, and when you REACH that capacity, inform visitors that tickets are sold out, or that they can hang at the arcade until people leave, at which point that line may enter. I honestly think that they just sell tickets until there are no more people to sell it to, and you'd agree if you were here right now. People are looking for seats. The pools are tremendously overcrowded. There are teenagers running around everywhere bumping up against people, and not enough lifeguards to maintain them. The toddlers area is way too small (and that's right, crowded), and there aren't enough accommodations for them when its jam-packed like this.   Maybe I'll come back during the colder season, but I'll definitely have to make sure I plan it so that we arrive when the doors open so that we get a spot for the car, a locker, and enough time for the baby to get some rides in.

Drove to my normal mechanic and only needed 2 parts for about 1/6 of the price.  Would not go to this place again."", ""If I could give zero stars I would. I never ever have had such an experience at an establishment. I came here with a group of 8 for a birthday dinner. We had more than 1 server. I have no idea what any of their names were. They give NO REFILLS on anything (soda, tea, lemonade, etc) which I think is insane! So they recommend buying a pitcher. The pitchers and ice bucket were both in plastic containers you can get from the dollar store.   We wait nearly 2 hours for our food. Majority of our party ordered mac & cheese as a side. Once we got our plates we noticed their was shrimp in our mac & cheese. When we questioned our server, she responded \""\""Oh I thought she told you we ran out\""\"". Mind you, that is completely fine, but what if someone had a seafood allergy?   To top it off, 2 of our party members (birthday girl included) did not receive their meals. They didn't even check back at the table until we flagged them down to report the missing plates. Our server then responded, \""\""I honestly don't even know what you ordered\""\"". We didn't even finish our food and the birthday girl didn't even want to eat them to even bother making her food since we had waited so long and they were closing. We asked to speak to a manager and was told they would come. When they didn't, we asked again. At this time, our \""\""server\""\"" (the same one we asked to get a manager) claimed she was the manager. WHICH WE KNEW WAS A LIE.   I understand they have just opened but theres no way an establishment should be run this way. Our entrees came out on glass plates, but everything else was on paper plates.   I WOULD NOT recommend this establishment to anyone. They didn't apologize or seem interested in good customer service."", ""Ok. I am not the type to complain, but I have been here twice and both times I have had terrible service at the bar. The first bartender served me but acted as if I was bothering him.  This second time, with a completely different bartender mind you, it was worse. I am not dressed like a street person or anything, and I am not pan-handling. But you would think that I was the way he acted. First, I sit at the bar and I am waiting for service. So, the bartender walks by me, pours a glass a water, turns in front of me, puts the water down, gives me some stupid half-grin then walks off. Not one audible word of greeting or a grunt passed between his lips. Then, he gets a menu, drops that down and walks off again! Not a sound. Is it me, but when a customer enters an eating establishment, shouldn't they be greeted in some manner?  Not looked at like \""\""why are you here. I have better things to do\""\""?  I am not looking for a royal salute or anything. Just \""\""Hey man, what can I get ya?\""\""  or something to that affect.   Anyway, I start to look at the drink and food menus. Then, a group of anywhere from 10-15 people come in behind me and say, to what looked like a manager, \""\""We don't want to eat, is it ok if we just have a few drinks at the bar?\""\"". The manager says \""\""Sure.\""\"" The guy then says, \""\""Can we get few beers down here\""\""? (paraphrasing). The bartender says \""\""Sure!\""\"" and proceed to service this group, one-by-one, as they order drinks. Ok, fine technically, I was looking at the menu when this started. But still, he walked back and forth, right in front of me, for about 10-12 minutes. Not once did he say, \""\""Hey, just shout and I will get you something\""\"", or \""\""Hey man, just give me a few minutes and I will be right with you\""\"". Nothing!  It was obvious it was a big group, but I mean, he gave no acknowledgement to the fact that I was sitting there waiting!   Long story short - after this 10-12 minutes of waiting, I just walked out and went somewhere else. Now this place has about 4\\5 stars with around 500 reviews. So, I guess people like it.

The waitress proceeded to run outside and tell the rest of the group that we were moving at which point they decided to stay outside, which was fine by my friend and I, but that meant having to be separated from our friends. This, to me, is deplorable behavior on the side of the the waitress and management. The waitress who was supposed to be our waitress inside as well, never arrived to the table and never checked up on us. Needless to say, I had to get another waiter and he was so appalled with the way that everything was handled he told my friend to not give him a tip.

We arrived about 1140a, or so.  The server also said the pad thai and the cashew chicken were the most popular dishes."", ""LUKE offers a great breakfast !

All were great and our waiter Jackson provided excellent service."", ""Ruined our Friday happiness.   Thought it would be nice to go to Friendly's for a family meal to start the weekend...but the moment we arrived, I knew we should have left.   Two employees at the front were talking to themselves, ignoring to greet us. When a 3rd employee asked his colleague where to seat us, she clearly wasn't eager to have us in her section, then she caught my eye as she then knew I heard her.   We were guided to our table -- right next to the kitchen entry...meanwhile 1/2 the place was empty, as we passed by booths with \""\""broken\""\"" signs on them and other dirty, uncleared tables. I asked to be seated at another booth--so we then were seated 1 row over from the kitchen entry...   The initial \""\""Hi, I'm so-and-so\""\"" was fine and we ordered our 3 meals and waited. Drinks arrived -- my glass of Coke was chipped and the other glass of Sprite tasted terrible, like seltzer. Asked for another Sprite and got the same terrible drink.   Later, I spotted our 3 meals on the warmer (remember, we are sitting 1 row away from the kitchen...) and ironically the warmer shelf is next to a clock. 6:02pm. Waited and waited...server finally walked by and I had to let her know that our meals were ready -- \""\""Let me check,\""\"" she says.  6:04pm. She goes missing...then she brings 2 of the 3 plates to our table and disappears again. I had to waved down another server and asked for my plate, still sitting on the warmer. 6:06pm. That server goes missing. Our original server finally brings my plate. Burger with the wrong cheese...over-cooked waffle fries. (Or maybe fries were over-cooked and dry from sitting under the warmer for 5 minutes as I stared at it.) Turkey BLT was subpar and the kids chicken fingers were over-cooked too.   I'm surprised the server came by later and asked how our meals were (albeit robotic) but not surprised that when we said I got the wrong cheese, she said \""\""sorry\""\"" without any suggestions or offers to make good on her mistake.   We were ready to pay and eager to leave...we waved down another server who said she couldn't take our payment as our assigned server had to do it. We said \""\""Can you let her know?\""\"" and she said \""\""I can't, she's with another table\""\"" and walked away. We were in disbelief that this experience just got worse.   The only good memorable moment was when I said under my breath \""\""This place is terrible,\""\"" and my young son repeated me.   Advice: Hire people who are actually Friendly or shut it down.

I came in on Black Friday to get a collar for my pooch, and ended up leaving with a very comfortable harness that he absolutely loves, and a great first impression.  The store has the variety I desired while not overwhelming the customer like the big box pet retailers. I saw some things that I'm seriously considering purchasing for my two pets, the dog wash looks spectacular, and I loved seeing the most trusted and wholesome brands on the shelves. One of the owners sold me the harness and was incredibly gracious about returns in case the harness didn't fit my dog, who is awkwardly sized for his weight. I didn't end up having to exchange it, but the help was welcomed.  TL;DR - Small town manners with variety and modern amenities."", ""Terrible customer service.

I have extremely long hair and I was there for a LONG time lifting color but it was no bother at all. Everyone was very nice to me and David worked me in (I went over the time I had scheduled since my hair is  so long) when other customers came in for appointments but I never felt like I was ignored at all.   My hair came out a beautiful golden and silver ombre and while I had originally thought I wanted a drastic dark to gray this was SO MUCH better than I imagined. I'm so happy I trusted Daivd to do what he does best. I have received so many compliments on the color and even the cut he gave (I'm not very willing to cut my long hair so he shaped it perfectly)!  I will definitely be back for haircut, toning, and after care!   I was shocked by the great price as well! I had asked around other salons and some people refused me, saying my hair would never get what I wanted (without seeing me) or that it would be upwards of $400 to cover the bleaching and dying PLUS haircut.

Not attractive.  My wife  ordered the brisket for lunch with mac and cheese and steamed veggies. I ordered the breakfast burger. My wife's entree came with more bbq sauce on the plate than meat. There were 4 skimpy pieces of brisket. It was hard to determine if the brisket was good because of the amount bbq sauce the.meat was swimming in. The bbq sauce tasted as if it was off the shelf KC's Masterpiece or Kraft.  It should have come on the side so the patron could decide how much or little was appropriate for their taste. The mac and cheese was bland and lacked the taste of cheese. Bad bad bad.  The burger I ordered was supposed to be done medium. Instead I got a lump of meat charcoal on a roll. The Sous or chef should be  ashamed of themselves for presenting this in the window for service. This is cooking 101.  The service was painfully slow.

I ordered the steak and eggs and when I asked our server if the eggs could be prepared over easy instead of scrambled, she said she didn't know because they pre scramble the eggs in the morning...  When our food came out it was atrocious. I am appalled that the kitchen would even send it out in the state that it was. 1 burger had an eggshell on it and the other had cold congealed cheese and the bun was twice the size of he burger. The steak and eggs were the size of a side. And the eggs were scrambled...  Advice to management- hire bussers and greet people as they walk in...

Once the advertisements were done and the movie started, that's when I noticed something wasn't right.  The entire screen was so dark that I was not able to make out the faces of the actors on the screen.  I kept lifting up the 3D glasses to see if it made a difference - nope.  The two people seated next to me were noticing the same and complaining.  I thought that maybe this is how the movie was filmed?  Then it got worse.  Even with the 3D glasses on, the shadows in the background on the screen were double and there was no discerning most actors' faces at all.  I got up and went to the lobby and asked for the manager.  The gentleman wore a blue shirt, middle age with a beard, said that this was the 3D experience, it was a \""\""closed-system\""\"" and there was nothing he could do.  I simply asked him to come with me into the theater to see with his own eyes how dark it was.  He would not and did not.  I suspect this wasn't the first time he's heard this from a customer.

So it was fine. I ordered the RW special that was salmon stuffed with a crab cake, and it was okay. I would have been fine if the food were on par with a 45 minute wait but it just was not worth it.

Ordered the Veggie Benedict, but asked if I could have it with egg whites. The server was puzzled and said that it already came with egg whites. Ok no big deal, it was strange that it wasn't listed that way on the menu but whatever. The server comes back a couple minutes later: \""\""It does come with normal eggs! All this time I thought poached eggs meant egg whites.\""\"" Uh, ok. A bit odd for a server at a restaurant that literally specializes in eggs, but still not an issue. She asks if I do indeed want the egg whites, and I say yes. A couple more minutes pass, and she comes back. \""\""Our kitchen doesn't know how to poach egg whites, so if you want them they'll have to scramble them.\""\"" What?? You poach an egg white just like you poach an egg. But whatever, I don't care that much so, \""\""Sure, that's fine.\""\""  It took us a very long time to get our food. The restaurant was not busy.

We mention it to the server who proceeds to tell us it's because the restaurant doesn't use heat lamps because \""\""they have so many hands.\""\"" Apparently not enough hands to get the food out within a half hour, and to get it out warm.   On to the food itself. I ordered what should've been a relatively healthy, easy meal. I got a plate that was literally covered in so much oil that my bennies were swimming. We're talking greasier than the greasiest Chicago pizza, but not due to fat from sausage or cheese. Oh no. There is no reason it should've been greasy at all, since all it had was spinach, wild mushrooms, asparagus, and tomatoes. It was literally just vegetable/canola oil. Even the side salad was drowning in its oily dressing. It was to the point that my own mother commented that if it had been her food, she wouldn't have touched it. We're not picky eaters; we eat anything and everything. So I proceeded to try some of my cold, oily concoction and unsurprisingly it tasted like nothing. It was so oily that none of the flavors of the vegetables could come out, and left my mouth, lips, and even fingers shining. And the hollandaise... oh god. What should've been a nice lemony-buttery sauce was a blob with the consistency of expired box pudding. Skin and all. And it tasted like nothing I've ever had before... maybe similar to cheese wiz?

Floors, booths, sides of booths are caked with old food. Service was slow at best. Baked potato tasted like it had been baked 3 days ago. Will NEVER go there again."", ""Fair warning, this is gonna be a long one, involving multiple locations and Southwest's \""\""Customer Service\""\"".    I was heading out this past Thursday to make my cousin's HS graduation in east TX.  My first warning this would be the trip from hell was a text warning me of a delay in Tucson (TUS).  I live an hour & a half east of TUS, but decided to leave the house as originally planned to ensure I could speak to a gate agent.    My layover was to be 45 minutes in Denver, yet the delay was already 55 minutes due to weather according to the SW gate agent in TUS.  I was quickly informed I wouldn't make my Denver (DEN) departure.  What ensued was a crazy spider web of options having me fly to LAX, staying overnight in DEN, flying to Houston, then Dallas Love Field (DAL), my final destination...arriving at 5:45pm, with a 7pm graduation to make two hours away.  No Go!  Finally the gate agent said, \""\""Can you drive to Phoenix?...there's a flight leaving at 7:40pm.\""\""  Realizing I had a nearly two hour drive, she quickly changed my flight & I hauled butt off-site to pick up my car & drive to PHX.   During the drive I realized the gate agent hadn't rescheduled my return flight & my car would be parked in PHX.  I quickly parked at the closest lot so I could speak to a gate agent, the parking later costing me $75 for a three day stay.  I stood for 45 minutes while the poor gate agent, Nancy, tried every way she could to reschedule my return flight so I could reunite with my car.  The system repeatedly gave her error messages & she couldn't even check in a stroller for two dazed parents.  All her calls to her supervisor yielded no physical response.  Nancy did her best, calling everyone she could & finally informed me \""\""for future reference, ensure the original agent changes your return flight too.\""\""  A tad too late in this instance & I just had to board the plane, resorting to a Facebook post that yielded a possible ride from TUS to get my car in PHX, something I didn't want to use.  Nancy entered some notes & told me to call the 1-800-I-FLY-SWA customer service number to reschedule once in Texas.   Sadly, this was the tip of the iceberg.    The flight, pilots & flight attendants were wonderful.  I arrived 55 minutes later than my original flight, thankful the rental car company was still available.  What was terrible was the website & lack of customer service at FLY SWA.   Over two days I called eight times, spending a total of 4 hours, 18 minutes & 49 seconds desperately trying to get a human on the line.  As a tip - SW get some decent Muzak!  I stayed up til 4am freaking out because no one would respond, despite two messages saying I would get a call back in 15 minutes and 7 minutes, respectively.  I made two Facebook posts, even messaging them, with FB communications rep Lindsey no help.  During one hour+ session on hold I did a Google search & discovered that SW's website had gone into \""\""meltdown\""\"" & their phone lines were overwhelmed due to their recent low fare sale.  Sure enough, I checked the website, & was booted off repeatedly.  I was in full-on panic now because it showed I had no upcoming flights, listing my departure was on my original TUS flight, with my return the rescheduled flight out of PHX - stupid considering this would've meant that I was in the air at the same time on two separate flights!  It was a very sleepless night imagining I was going to have to book another very expensive, short-notice, flight just to get back to my car.   Finally my cousin said \""\""to hell with SW, let's go to Walmart & buy some wine!\""\""  Once again, I was on the phone, on hold buying a kiddie pool & booze when an angel named Rhonda finally answered.  24 minutes later I finally had a direct return flight to PHX, with a three hour drive home when I returned.  I have always loved the flight crews & agents at SW.  I love that they give snacks on the plane & their in-flight cocktails are reasonably priced.  But this was a very stressful \""\""adventure\""\"" I don't ever want to repeat.  After all was said & done, Rhonda informed me I somehow have a miraculous credit of $133 I must use in the next two months.  I am searching for a brave soul to purchase the ticket for since I really don't want to fly SW ever again.  Sadly, SW is typically more expensive than other carriers, particularly since I rarely need to check a bag, & if I do, it's always free since I'm in the military. In addition, there's no assigned seating for the extra cost.  (As a comedian once said \""\""Ever fly Southwest?...One thru Forty...GO!!!\""\"")  I might also add that most other carriers will let military pre-board, while Southwest does not.    I sincerely hope my experience this past weekend was a rare one & dedicated flyers fare better than I."", ""My favorite place to eat sushi and the nicest people I know that work there!

I had a house full of guests  and the general consensus for dinner was island cuisine. Unfortunately, I forgot that this is the Penn Relay weekend (huge mistake). After driving 1.5 hour and taking 30 minutes to find a $15 parking space, I finally arrived. The place was not too packed but half the patrons were gathered around the ordering counter. It took me a few minutes to realize that this increadibly roudy, vulgar bunch had aready placed their orders but were just hanging out at the counter, thus preventing newly arrived customers from placing their orders. I tried my best to get noticed and to get to the counter but had no luck. Ultimately, I and a few other customers (or should I say \""\""potential customers\""\"" eventually gave up and left. The cincher for me was that the staff were clearly aware of what was occurring but made no attempt to control the crowd. I may have waited if the staff showed some business savvy and kept the counter area clear but unfortunately, they appeared overwhelmed and confused. i've eaten at the Jerk Hut several times (food is OK-good) but this visit left a bad taste in my mouth so I may have to reconsider future trips across the bridge for authentic JA CUISINE!!

Recently I found that they shrunk their menu. I'm ok with that because I understand the economy and the need to shave off extra meals that don't sell well. Apparently, this included any burger other than the \""\""burger\""\"". They have toppings for it, however without being mentioned on the menu, you'd never know it. I used to love their hawaiian burger and mushroom burger. GREAT... I mean GREAT burgers. I still can't ding them on the food itself. Everything else on my last visit was a trainwreck. I ate with co-workers. One asked for sweetener for her tea. It didn't arrive. She asked again, and it didn't arrive. She asked a third time, and out of spite the server Andrew shoved 2 entire containers full of sweeteners. Like she needed 2 of them. One would suffice and they were slammed down in front of her as if to teach her a lesson.

We ordered three different shareable apps for the table and I honestly can't recall which three because they were gobbled up. One guy ordered shrimp and grits, I ordered the diver sea scallop app, and the others all ordered barbecue shrimp. My scallops practically melted off my fork. Devine! We all got a spoonful of grits which were beyond fab. And I ate at least 1/3 of my neighbor's shrimp. We had to get extra bread to sop up the goodness left over.  Ordered three absolutely fabulous desserts to share as well. I mean I'm glad I had a small plate so I could help others clean theirs!!!

I read many good reviews about this establishment. If I could give them no stars I would. Could not run out of there fast enough. Their half peeled shrimp was literal mush. They had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. The shrimp peel was brown, they were probably cooked about a month ago, put in a freezer and served them to me as they thawed. Their jambalaya was further than the truth. It was pasta in tomato sauce with a minuscule piece of chicken. And the fact that I had to pay as I left was bewildering. Not even their mediocre waiters could save, what I would call, the worst dining experience of my life.

She said that this will take 40 minutes to make it ready. She pointed to a group of people sitting of about 25 persons and implied that they were busy making food for them. Afterwards, I asked her what about just a regular appetizer like hummus and baba gannoush. She again said that they need 40 minutes to prepare it! Also she pointed at the same group of people with her finger.  At that point I just left the restaurant.  It is horrendous that they needed 40 minutes to prepare hummus!!

Food came out not as ordered, tho was  very good as it always is... or maybe we were just that hungry after waiting so long.  Also learned our server was the assistant manager... if that's how much the assistant manager cares about customers and great service how is the rest of the place suppose to care?   I wrote in and spoke with the manager just to let him know. He was very professional and kind about it, even sent free drink coupons but even that has me questioning if I'll ever return... what goods a free drink if you have to wait almost an hour to drink it?

We wanted two orders of the Short Rib fries appetizer, since we would be having it as our dinner opposed to sharing it, and she looked at us like we asked her to bring the whole cow to our table. She asked us if we were sure that we wanted two, and we confirmed that we did.

I'm not really a nail person, I get my nails done maybe once a month. I tried to explain to her how I wanted them done, which was kind of hard because of the language barrier. I don't like the fake plastic tip because they damage your real nail. I watched several Youtube videos on how a silkwrap was a better alternative. Anyway because I wanted a little length to my nails she was going to use the plastic tips. I told her no, and I explained to her why. She said so you want to use your own nail, I said yes. Long story short and $35 later I have a regular manicure. When I saw how short she was filing the nail (which was my own nails length), I asked her what she was doing. She stated this is how its done and there was nothing else she could do since I didn't want the tips. So even though I was unsatisfied with her service I tip her anyway. I guess she was unhappy with the tip and after she finished painting my nails, she had me dry them using the mini fan at her station. Normally they take you to the drying station. And I was supposed to receive another service, but she started work on someone else. By this time I'm livid; I grab my things and left. I was able to find another place to get my eye brows done (Brown Spa; which they did an excellent job and was very polite). I asked the tech about silkwraps and she confirmed what I though. She also told me she never goes to Tip Top Nails \""\""they're terrible\""\"". I was able to find the Youtube video, so I went back to Tip Top Nails and show it to her. She said they don't do it like that, and that if I showed her the video before she would have told me no. They refused to do my nails the way I wanted them, and refused to give me a refund.

I understand if they were busy or off hours or something reasonable, but no. You can hear them holding conversations, that if were management they would be fired on the spot. You get a sense of not being welcomed as if your inconveniencing them. Then after waiting, they bring your order to your car and say nothing. No sorry for the wait, or bla bla. I have learned the hard way to not leave until you check your food to make sure its 100%. 9 out of 10 times my order is wrong in some way.

No garnishes on the plates, no toast with the eggs, nothing special. We didn't bother to complain because no one wanted to wait another hour for food.

After getting the typical shabby job on a fill with French tips,  I accidentally smudged two nails really badly.  They needed to be repainted and I asked her to do so... I even offered to pay extra.  The nail tech came over to look and she pressed the clumps back down and painted right back over the mess (didn't even keep the paint in the lines) then slathered so much varnish over the train wreck that it was literally dripping down my finger. After my nails were dry enough to leave,  another tech rang me up and the receipt had no place for a tip.  When I asked,  he told me I had to pay tips in cash...

We were seated quickly and our server gave us our drinks quickly, but it was a downturn after that. First the chips and salsa were tasteless, I have found better tasting salsa from jar salsa at the grocery store. Also we waited for ridiculous 45 minutes for our food to come out. All we ordered was tacos, a burrito, and one chicken enchilada. Simple freaking meals...I mean come on that should take 10 minutes. After the server gave us our food finally...he never came back to check if we needed anything else. We could not even flag anyone to refill our waters. The burrito and tacos were very bland but edible. The chicken enchilada was the worst enchilada I have ever had. I couldn't even eat it. The red sauce on it tasted like some old can enchilada sauce that has been sitting in their kitchen for awhile. After we were done eating we sat there for another 15 minutes before the server came to our table. I told him I didn't like the enchilada and he did take it off the check, but that doesn't make up for one of the worst service from a restaurant that I have experienced. We won't be back.

First off, last time I checked, Nordstrom does not sell toilet bowl cleaner, tissue paper, laundry detergent, etc. So you should come up with a better argument. No matter which way you look at it, this Kmart is the absolute worst. They never have anything in stock, the customer service is a joke, it's filthy, it's outdated, it's overpriced for a Kmart (I can drive down to Target in Ventura and get everything at least two dollars cheaper), and filled with absolutely unnecessary things. The only reason this Kmart is the second most successful in the country is because it is the ONLY option in the Goleta/Santa Barbara area and because kids moving to isla vista who need all new furniture and supplies do not know any better when they first move to the area. No one in their right mind should give this place more than one star. I am so EMBARRASSED and DISGUSTED that this is our only option in Santa Barbara. Someone PLEASE start a petition for Target.

Then about 2 months ago Amy left. So I let the owner Angela do my nails. The first time was ok. Then the second time she did them the gel polish (which she talked me into getting instead of regular polish) started to chip within a day. I called and complained, she redid the polish and again within one or two days it was chipping. Now my nails look at mess. I don't trust her to correct the problem.

The building was impossible to find (in an office building with NO signs whatsoever or indication of the spa), and when I arrived the front desk staff was on the phone, busy, and had no time for me. She checked my name in and told me to sit down, then walked away before I could ask where the waiting area was.   The wax was the worst wax I've ever had - and I've been waxing for years. Erica didn't double-dip the sticks, but used the paper strips over and over, which I found unsettling. The conversation was fine, she was pleasant enough but did a terrible job. This next part is a bit ahem, graphic, so first-time waxers beware...   Compared to other aestheticians that take their time and position your legs in various positions to get the best possible view and angle for waxing, she simply had me open one leg at a time and waxed the entire area like that. This was much more painful, as each area was not pulled taut when she waxed, and resulted in an unsightly (not to mention painful) bruise in my nether regions. The rest of the area was red for hours longer than it usually is.  Then, when I went to pay, the girls behind the desk were *again* on the phone/talking/too busy to talk to me. After a while, I finally got someone's attention, but while I was her asking a question, the phone rang. Without so much as asking me to hold on, she answered it, began talking, and walked away. I signed my credit card receipt and stood there awkwardly, alone, wondering if I was finished. Finally, when they noticed me, I asked if I was done. The woman said yes and just waved me away.   I escorted myself out, feeling dismissed and completely unimportant. Although the spa is very nice and high-end, I got the impression they cater preferentially to more wealthy clientele, and regular people like me were just dismissed without a thought."", ""This was our first experience eating lunch at Cheddar's. Our server was Joey.  We really appreciated that our food was made after we ordered it, rather than being prepared hours before.  Joey brought us coffee and--my test of an attentive server--keep our coffee and water filled up.  When we were low on coffee, instead of warming up our coffee, he brought new cups.  This was typical of the excellent service.      The food was superb.  I had a medium-rare steak; it was actually cooked medium-rare, which does not always happen.  The flavor of all our entrees and side orders was very tasty.      We plan to go back frequently.  Heartily recommended.  The wait is noted in other reviews, and it's because of the quality of food.

The guy working the counter could tell I was shocked (an oil change at the dealer usually costs $35).  He explained they had used synthetic oil. When I asked why they would give me synthetic oil when I didn't ask for it, he gave me some BS answer that it was standard for Toyotas.

I am 2 months into my membership and have only been able to use the service in one out of four attempts. I was understanding after the first cancellation and simply rescheduled my appointment. After the second time, I asked to extend my membership for another month as I had gone a full month without having been able to use it. I was told my membership could not be extended as it was a voucher and I was given a $25 credit to my account for a 'future cleaning' in compensation.   I have now been canceled on a third time. Today I didn't even receive a phone call. I received only an email, though curiously it states that they were \""\""recently in touch\""\"" to let me know about the cancellation. Perhaps they were confused and were thinking of the last 2 times they cancelled? That aside, the email was sent an hour before the scheduled start time. Apart from the general inconvenience of being cancelled and left with a house that needs to be cleaned, I had left work early (using personal time) and was on my way home to receive the cleaner by the time I saw the e-mail. The e-mail provided no contact information, only links to Facebook and Twitter accounts. I found a phone number on a previous e-mail from one of the client account specialists who had contacted me following a previous cancellation so I called that number. I spoke with a lovely gentleman who confirmed that I have experienced a high number of cancellations. He told me that a member of the Trust and Safety Department was to have contacted me previously to follow up regarding my first 2 cancellations. I let him know that I had received no such call.  He told me that I would receive a call from that department, most likely later today, to hopefully resolve the issue. We'll see if that happens but I know for sure that I will not be recommending you to anyone and I will be contacting the BBB for a resolution if your team doesn't provide a refund for the 'membership' that I have been unable to use.  UPDATE: The company ended up refunding me $20 (I was asking for $30 to cover the cost of the membership I was unable to use) so that was at least something. The person who emailed me apologized and told me that the frequent cancellations were due to limited availability in my area. I find it disingenuous to give that as an excuse after I went to the site, I looked at a calendar of available times for a specific cleaner and chose from those times and was even sent a confirmation. If those times weren't available then they shouldn't be listed. Limited availability, to me, would mean I would have a difficult time booking the appointment in the first place, not be cancelled on at the last minute.   As they are a broker site (which I didn't realize at first) and not the actual provider company, these cleaners accept jobs booked from the site and I assume then cancel if a higher paying opportunity comes up.  If that's the case, there should be a system in place that penalizes the cleaners for canceling (since the consumer is penalized for a last minute cancellation) or better yet does not allow them to book through the site after a certain number of cancellations."", ""Searching with no direction I stumbled upon this fantastic little mother/daughter operation.

Food came out not as ordered, tho was  very good as it always is... or maybe we were just that hungry after waiting so long.  Also learned our server was the assistant manager... if that's how much the assistant manager cares about customers and great service how is the rest of the place suppose to care?   I wrote in and spoke with the manager just to let him know. He was very professional and kind about it, even sent free drink coupons but even that has me questioning if I'll ever return... what goods a free drink if you have to wait almost an hour to drink it?

There were 4 skimpy pieces of brisket. It was hard to determine if the brisket was good because of the amount bbq sauce the.meat was swimming in. The bbq sauce tasted as if it was off the shelf KC's Masterpiece or Kraft.  It should have come on the side so the patron could decide how much or little was appropriate for their taste. The mac and cheese was bland and lacked the taste of cheese. Bad bad bad.  The burger I ordered was supposed to be done medium. Instead I got a lump of meat charcoal on a roll.

Cashier gave us a hard time stating that her management dictated that she wasn't allowed to apply the coupon if we were combining it with a senior discount. What logic is that? How would it be any different if I had paid for myself and my mother in law, applied the coupon. Then told my father in law, the senior, to pay on his own. Seriously, Retarded.   This is on YOU management not that poor girl. Either for not creating a better customer experience or poorly training your staff."", ""I haven't eaten here in a while because a friend of mines quit, due to rude employers. But I was just starving. I went to order an omelette with the veggies wrapped inside instead of cooked in. I was told that I could not have it that way. Once I asked why??? Both cashiers snapped at me and told me that the cook had the right to make it however he pleased and couldn't I see how busy they were. And they didn't have anytime to special make my order.... After a verbal argument between me and the staff the had to nerve to ask if I still wanted to order. This place has good food but very very poor customer service skills. I will never spend my money there ever again... The worst service I have ever received."", ""Poor service and overpriced hookah.

I immediately contacted them and of course have not heard back after over a week. This company has no desire to make anything right. As I said in my first review not only do they have an \""\""F\""\"" with the BBB, take a look at all their reviews on the internet. PLEASE spend your hard earned money with a company that deserves it."", ""Awful awful awful went in today to have lunch with my husband we ordered we get to the register and they inform us there's no ice for the drinks we ordered do we still want them I say yes because I made the wrongful assumption that the soda would at least be cold and drinkable boy was I wrong not only was it hot but it had no carbonation what so ever. Now mine you we paid for these drinks I don't know about you but I've worked in the food industry and my store has ran out of ice before and we went to the grocery store and bought bags of ice brought them back and made sure our customers were happy until we could fix the situation apparently that was not the managers idea at this store. So instead of just saying sorry our drink situation sucks today u can have it for free they charge us. I went to 5 guys and got us cold drinks we started eating our burritos were disgusting they tasted like cat food and the chips were completely plain no lime or salt at all! Clearly someone has dropped the ball at this chipotle because it was complete garbage! I hope they can turn this store around because they've now lost a customer"", ""Thought we would try this place out for a quick bite with the kids. The food was terrible, even the kids burger which was about half the size of the bun (didn't think you could mess up a kid burger). I had the crab cake pasta which was bland and full of crab shells. My husband had the white beans which were not yo momma's for sure."", ""We use to love to go to this location. I don't know what's happened but our last two visits have been horrible service and food left a lot to be desired!

We will try another dot's location."", ""Okay lets start from the beginning.  1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn't bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me \""\""Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card\""\"". I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in. So strike 1 is the rude staff in a \""\""MAJOR\""\"" hotel!  2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor).  So Strike 2 is in a \""\""MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!  3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower.  So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a \""\""MAJOR\""\"" hotel!  4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a \""\""MAJOR\""\"" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot. So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a \""\""MAJOR\""\"" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.  5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!! Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!  6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door. Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.  All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!"", ""0 Stars for customer service would be appropriate. The disaster they created for my daughter's confirmation cannot be put in words. Everybody is entitled to make mistakes even big ones it's how they handle them.  Allow me to describe the situation. It all started when we receive the Box minutes before our luncheon with somebody else's name on it. The cake didn't fit in the box so we walked across town with an open box.  When we open the Box it had our daughter's name on it however it looked like it was written by a first grader. None of the requested decorations including the Holy Cross and others were not included which was the purpose of the cake. The top it off the cake was  completely dry would have been better off with a cake from acme. The cake was loaded with these plastic sticks and I'm unsure why we counted over 40 of them, making it impossible to cut. We attempted to call master Baker several times and they were not open finally 2 weeks after the event were able to get ahold to somebody who could actually care less......\""\"" said thank you for the learning experience we will discuss it are a next meeting.\""\"" That's it No desire to disgusted details and all they did was criticize us for waiting so long to get back to them when in fact they were never open when we called. We had photograph evidence of what they provided us still unwilling to listen.  Well Chad I can't believe you would treat customers like we were treated."", ""Horrible customer service.  Customers should be allowed to try on another size.  The sales associate actually refused to get me another size, which is not what I have experienced at other stores.  I wasn't asking for anything out of the ordinary, I only took in 2 bras and wanted ONE of them in a different size.  The store wasn't busy so I don't understand her reluctance. You can give me advice on how it should fit, but don't make me stand there peeking out of the fitting room doorway, half dressed, trying to justify why I just want to *try* the next size up.  I know how I want my lingerie to fit and will go elsewhere where I won't be put in such a humiliating situation."", ""Cannot vouch for the doctor, as the receptionist was so breathtakingly rude that I didn't even schedule an appointment.

The facial was the worst one I've ever had. No extractions. The lady didn't even speak to me. My face just felt oily after. The pedicure was worst. She filed my nails for 40 minutes. They looked jagged and the paint job was messy. There was no place to wait for my feet to dry and I had to ask of it was ok to wait at the bowl. No massage, not even any lotion.

I hope they are successful bringing authentic Indian food to Nashville."", ""I think I am giving it five stars because this place was a real surprise. I have never been to a place like this- just altogether special in decor, service, food and drink... You will not regret swinging by here.  One, the place is adorable. Upon first glance, one might note that it is reminiscent of an old industrial factory, but more like a factory that a group of rag-tag children made into a playhouse. Vibrant color, flowers, natural lights fun stair cases, decorative window panes... Really fun environment.   Service was a little slow, but considering they were packed to the brim because of our conference I let it slide. Waitress and hostess were really friendly.   This place has delicious and fresh burgers that come in such unique flavor combinations. I came back a second time just to try another one. First one I had was the Hog-Thai'ed which was a peanut glazed burger served with Thai rice noodles. SOOOOOO GOOOD. The one I had the next day was the American. (If you're worried about your cardiovascular health, please don't eat this one.) it is your classic bacon burger topped with melted cheese and fried Mac-n-cheese. Let's just say it changed me. Fries are amazing and paired perfectly with their unique sauces. Loved the sriracha mayo. A must try.   They also serve a million types of sodas including draft sodas, shakes (loved the cinnamon shake) as well as boozy shakes which are as wonderful wd they sound.   If you're looking for THE place in downtown St. Louis, please stop here."", ""Let's stop it with the shenanigans people. This place is the cream de la crem (yes that was intended). After scouring the dimly lit side streets and the overpriced cafes on state I stumbled upon a good cup of coffee. Delicious red eyes, coffee, an eclectic tea collection, and I don't say this lightly. THE BEST CROISSANT in the 805.   First a little about moi. I am a noted croissant specialist who has munched on pastries from Paris to Brussels to Omaha and I know a thing or two about France's favorite breakfast. Good cup has manifested a croissant with a brilliantly flaky outer layer which upon the first bite reveals a soft, fresh, delectable middle. Peets coffee and Starbucks obviously lack in their pastry game due to the frozen garbage they parade around as food and the French press provides a croissant with adequate flakiness but just not the same dough. The only place which rivals good cup for its bread quality is d'angelos bakery which has the sb bread game on lock down.   While it is shameful that there are no coffee shops in this town other than Starbucks open past 10pm on most nights, if you happen to walk past good cup when it is open please head in. You will be greated by an always friendly customer service team, a low key and relaxing ambiance, great beverages, and the best damn pastries and gelato around."", ""I went to Andr\u00e9 Richards yesterday for the first time because I had. groupon for a wash, cut, trim, dry and highlights and because I've been looking for a good place in Philly.  The salon had a good set up with plenty of space, especially for a Philly salon. It's kind of hidden on Locust Street, but spacious.   I was about 5 minutes late due to parking further away, but the salon got me in and within a few minutes, LB was going over what I wanted. She was super cool and we had some good conversation while the foils were going in. After they were all put in and set, the foils came out, toner went in for some more waiting. LB was good about checking up on things and offering coffee, water and tea. After everything was done setting, I got a good cut that was exactly what I asked for. I was pleased itch the outcome and it really didn't feel like it took 3 hrs like it has at other places I've been too!

This was our first visit to GAP. We now have season passes and will continue to come and enjoy the shows!  There is not a bad seat in the house because the GAP has multilevels. We were seated quickly given that bowl of popcorn and drink and food orders were taken.  The Chicken wings were fabulous and The Meatball Sub flavorful.  Later we had the Chocolate Brownie Sundae with three scoops of vanilla ice cream , a wonderful brownie and lots of hot fudge with whipped creme and a cherrie on top!  The music preshow was enjoyable. The show started on time using stage left for an intimate set up of the plot! The cast was talented and thoroughly entertaining as they escorted you through the acts of the show! Song and dance was not disappointing and many laughs were had with the funny dialogues. The Olio was hilarious as Melanie rollerskated through the audience and Tom Jones did his mingle invasion.   As Gaslight theater fans for the last 23 years we give a BIG  5 STAR RECOMMENDATION to support the GAP! Get the word out!"", ""Best Cheesesteak in Philly !

If you want reheated frozen food, this is your place. Decor is not good, food is not good. Boo. Bathroom was clean. That's earns it A star.  Poor tourists! If they come to Philly and come here, they are getting a very poor representation of what Philly has to offer in dining. Very poor, indeed! Take a picture of the mural and keep walking. There are many, many better places on South St. and around the corners on 2nd, 3rd, and 4th streets."", ""I went when they first opened and I didn't want to judge too harshly because it's a new place. I waited several weeks to try again, even worse!! We came for a show with a band and sat at a high top table by the bar. Nobody came by to say hi or ask about drinks. We waited 15 minutes and still not service, I get it, it's busy. So I go to the bar. The bartender is busy with other guest, she says she will be right with me, 15 mins later still haven't been helped. The manager is very present and visible the whole time.  He is yelling at servers and comparing about not doing their jobs. But he doesn't even notice that I have not been helped yet. Finally another bartender helps me and I walk my drinks back to my party. Still nobody has come by our table. We were there for a while and no server has come by and the manager was very oblivious to our distaste or the fact we needed help. On top of that, there was crazy feedback on the music and you couldn't even hear the singing. We finished our beers and went elsewhere. Very disappointing."", ""Stopped by on my way out of Nashville for a quick bite. Mistake. As soon as I walked in the manager made an offensive comment about my appearance (I have long hair and a beard so she referred to me as \""\""baby Jesus\""\"") Not a good start.  Food quality was very poor even for a buffet, and the stock was extremely low on everything, and what was there was cold and unpleasant. Drinks never were refilled.   I tried to salt my food and discovered not one, but all salt shakers were caked with water and unfunctional. When I asked the server for fresh salt she proceeded to check the tables and came back several minutes later with what she claimed was \""\""the best she could find\""\"" rather than making a fresh bottle, and it was just as caked as the others.   If I had to say one positive thing about it, I'd say that I'm 90% positive that the steak was made from actual beef!

We were in pursuit of a good place to eat.  We passed Han Dynasty and like the ambience. We decided to give it a try. We sat at the bar area. The two gentlemen working the bar were extremely helpful and welcoming. They explained the menu to us. Everything is cooked fresh.  We love spicy food. The hotter the better; the food was so amazingly flavorful I would drive back from Washington, DC just to eat here again. I had the Cumin Pork spiced to level 10 my friend had chicken fried rice. We like very hot food most places even in DC cannot get the balance of heat and flavor right even when dishes are request extra spicy. Han Dynasty did!! The customer service and the food are worth giving this place a try if you like spicy food.  It would be a great business move for them if they opened one in the District of Columbia.

Best wings in town in my humble opinion (tip: order them plain, get the medium sauce on the side) then dip in sauce & ranch to your heart's content.

Also nice is that you can order beverages by the pitcher which saves money."", ""Best Bagels in the greater Philadelphia area!"", ""I can't speak for anything but the Red Beans and Rice, as my husband and I come here exclusively for that and order the same thing every time!

My egg plant parm was perfect. I will definitely go back to this restaurant again."", ""I cannot believe I haven't written a review for my favorite restaurant in Louisiana! Seriously, if I was on death row, the BBQ Shrimp would be last thing my taste buds ever enjoyed. I highly suggest wearing the bib they give you - unless of course you like to wear your dinner proudly.   Even if you aren't a shrimp fan, their filets are always cooked to perfection and their gumbo is delicious.   Don't forget to grab a cocktail too - their Bloody Mary's will save your life.

This coffee is so good that I buy 5#s at a time from Brigitte. It is always fresh and she has even delivered coffee to me while she is under construction of her new place. Personally, I cannot wait until she opens her new location. I never did care much for the Hollander Hotel and I often felt that she was being stifled by the cramped space she worked in. Also, the hotel has a funky smell (sort of like old socks) so I will be glad when she is at her new location and I can sit and enjoy a good cup of coffee without trying to filter out the bad smell from the hotel.

Not only did it take almost 2 hours to get the food delivered but we were told a half an hour after we placed the order that it was on the grill(he called back because of credit card issues.)  I will never get anything from this place again."", ""I definitely won't be coming back here. Long story short, I scheduled an appointment online to have the transmission and differential fluid changed on my pilot. I arrived on time, and I was told it would take approximately 2 hours for completion, I also said I wanted an oil change, but \""\"" full synthetic\""\"". He said it would be $20 more, I said okay. When it was finally done and I was ready to check out, my advisor (Brandon) give me the total cost, which was double than what I expected and paid for in the past. I asked him what was all done, he said, \""\""they completed a transmission flush instead of the regular drain and refill\""\"". I told him that's not what I wanted or asked for. He went on to say \""\""it was good for the car and whatever\""\"", like I'm some kind of idiot. First of all Honda doesn't recommend doing a transmission flush and secondly, its almost triple what you would normally pay for a standard transmission fluid change. On top of that they didn't even do a full synthetic oil change it was just a blend. I didn't have time to argue with him because I was already late for an appointment, but I have the email showing what I originally asked for, so I'll be calling my bank soon."", ""Change the name of this place to \""\""$12 a night just to park at this dump\""\"" and maybe there is a chance at more than one star because I never made it past the less than persuasive garage attendant.

Upon arriving, you are immediately welcomed with the scent of fresh baked cookies. Walking up to the desk we were greeted by Valorie who informed us that cookies and water were complementary to guests and that we were more than welcome. Across from the desk we noticed a book shelf. This is not the kind of book shelf where rejected leftovers were placed but rather, a wide range of books by well known authors. The name of the program was called Read it and Return. In essence, you can borrow a book for the duration of your stay and if you don't finish it you can return it the next time you stay at the hotel at any of the Carlson hotels who have the same program! ( what!?! Cookies and books!?! YES!) Right off the bat, we felt like we were right at home.     Arriving at our room, we noticed that everything was extremely clean and there was a refrigerator (with a small freezer) , a microwave, a coffee maker, and a well working A.C. (you know, the kind that you don't have to yell over to have a conversation). The bathroom was stocked with brand name shampoo, conditioner, and lotion.    Our next stop was the smoking area. Normally, smokers feel as though they have been marooned to a small place behind the dumpster...but not here! Provided was 2 sets of swinging benches; set far enough away so that it did not disturb the guests in rooms around the area but no a 10 mile hike for those adults who enjoy the pleasure. Did I also mention they have smoking rooms available?  In the morning, feel free to partake in a complimentary breakfast (NOT CONTINENTAL)-I mean a real breakfast which changes daily; anything from fresh made waffles to eggs, sausage, and bacon! Also, cold cereal, juices, and coffees have options! Coffee is available 24/7 as well!   The hotel also has a pool and hot tub which I personally observed them clean daily!  On our last night we got back late and I was going to ask the desk for a late check out, but there was no need! Their check out time is 12:00 Pm as opposed to the hotel usual of 11:00 Am. That worked out well for us.  At checkout we were asked if there was anything we would change about the hotel or our stay. I made small suggestions which I thought would help them, but definitely nothing major. The desk person wrote down what I said and said she would pass it on! I was impressed with that, because we've been asked about our stay at other places, but it seemed more out of routine than actual interest. Here, she seemed genuinely interested. We don't usually do reviews, so I'm sorry for the long review. However, we wanted you to get a real feel for this wonderful hotel and hope that you enjoy it as much as we did! Thanks for reading and safe travels. J & Niki."", ""They used to make an Amiga bowl that had an abundance of shredded grilled chicken on the bottom of a flour tortilla bowl, a layer of rice topped with grilled onions and peppers with a queso sauce drizzeled over the top. Tonight there was no rice nor any shredded chicken, it had been replaced with chicken crisps. They are the outer parts of a grilled chicken breast with no moisture and very few of them. Having met the owner in the past and having his wife wait on me I knew something wasn't right. I explained to the waitress that this dish had changed and wasn't good! She politely offered something else. What to order...if they had modified a basic dish what was next? To my surprise a male manager came out and \""\""informed\""\"" me that this is exactly what they had been serving for 10 years and I must have either special ordered something or was mistaken. I said this is not what they had served me for the past 5 years and I never had requested a special order before.  I also asked what they had done to the phenominal soft tacos? They were usually served in a soft warm flour tortilla and had moisture and flavor. Tonight they were stale and crisp and the filing was bland.  Again he informed me I was mistaken while he held my order that had been sent back to the kitchen in front of me. I apologized and said I didn't wish for anything else, thank you. Another manager came out a few moments later apologizing and stated that they are unfamiliar with what I had ordered and would \""\""special order\""\"" anything I wanted. I declined. Apparently their cook walked out tonight and they were winging it. Too bad it was a good place to get a good mexican meal. Two thumbs down on Poblano's."", ""I am so done with this franchise.    We had been ordering from them almost weekly since they opened and at first, their pizza was outstanding.  Plenty of toppings, spicy sauce, and a light crunchy crust.  Gradually, however, they declined in quality and quantity.  We quit ordering for many months.  Last weekend, we gave it another try, but it has gotten worse.  Very skimpy toppings and the crust was slightly underdone.  The pizzas in the box looked nothing like the pics on the box.  I'd say our pizzas were equivalent to a $5 hot-n-ready from Little Caesar's, but we paid ~$15 each.  So very, very dissappointed."", ""My favorite place in Philly! First found this place last year but didn't remember the name, Yelp to the rescue! So glad I found this place. The decor is to die for, from the outside seating to the first floor dining room, the upstairs side room to the bar area with live music this place has it all.   The live music is amazing, need to find a place like this in DC! Both times I've been the band and singer had people up and dancing and everyone clapping. The drinks are great, the bartenders are more like mixologist and the food is not your average bar food. Never had a bad drink, they are light and refreshing and strong! My boyfriend and I ordered the pulled pork empanadas and I ordered the mushroom salad. The 2 medium sized empanadas came out hot and filled with tender perfectly cooked pork. The pork wasn't covered with seasoning or sauce which was great because it let the natural pork flavor shine, if they don't have the cover with other flavors you know it's good! The mushroom salad was light but filling (if that makes sense) looked small but once I mixed it all together it was a good sized salad. The tart and tangy dressing was a perfect mix with the creamy goat cheese and the crystallized ginger gave it a little sweetness. The mushrooms were the perfect topping and blended right in. The bartenders are very friendly, attentive and fast. This place is a perfect 10... well, 5 star."", ""So P.O.'d...they were my 'go to' delivery place.

She was doing great until Thursday, when we noticed her getting a little slow and not wanting to eat.  We decided friday when we both got home from work, to take her in.  This place was the closest and recommend by our vet clinic for emergency service.  They wanted to do a series of test and x-rays.  I was fine with the blood work but really wasn't excited about dosing our poor little girl with radiation for the x-rays.  The Vet told me it was necessary.  So we sucked up the $650 charge and had the work done.    At this time the Vet said there was not an elevated white cell count and that the dog was not dehydrated.  I asked about maybe a course of nursing friendly antibiotics. The vet recommended that we do immediate surgery to extract her uterus.  We did plan on having the dog spayed but this was a big shock.  The poor little dog just had puppies, was nursing and now they wanted to fillet her open! WTF?! How could they possibly think this was a good idea.  Not only that, it was getting a little annoying how every time they recommended something, they would step out and come back with a piece of paper stating they wanted your next paycheck up front.  So we declined the $3,000 emergency surgery, paid our $650 bill and left with a course of antibiotics.  Our little dog is doing just fine.  She had a mild infection but kicked it. Glad we have enough education and experience to have made the most conservative and preservative decision of our dog.    And I won't even get into the story about when we saw the $3000 estimate for surgery and the Vet said that if it was not affordable, some people do choose to euthanize.  I grew up on a ranch, I work emergency medicine, and understand the circle of life, but this place just plain baffled me.  It seemed more like a place that wanted to ring you dry for cash rather than try to help you make the right decision for you and your animal.  We told our regular vet about our experience and she was even pretty taken back about the price of everything.   Will we not return."", ""The best of the best! Great outfitters with great employees.

I went with my wife and two kids on a Saturday evening and although they didn't appear to be that busy, it took 15 minutes to get a table and another 20 minutes to pay at the counter once we were done eating.   I don't really enjoy eating at Waffle House, but I would have had a much better experience at the Waffle House across Briley  I'm sure."", ""It pains me to rate anyone a single star, but I really was disappointed with my meal at Market Grill last night and won't be back.    We, a three-some, went on the recommendation of an acquaintance.  First impression walking in the door, smoke-free (yay!) and beautiful original brickwork, but a really scrubbed-clean feeling.  Which is good, or could be.  Maybe it just felt out of place in Soulard :).    From there it was all downhill.  The menus we were given were dog-eared, ripped, with pen marks and spots of indeterminable provenance.  Poor impression.  Print some new menus.    We were not offered a drink list.  When I asked for the drink list, the server said, \""\""We don't have a drink list, but I can get you a wine menu.\""\""  But there is a neon Bud Light sign in the window.  If you don't have a list printed, use your voice and tell me what you offer.  A note on the wine menu: sorted into reds and whites.  Fair enough.  Beneath the reds?  The whites.  And beneath the whites?  The reds.  Print some new menus.  And considering the venue, their wine pricing is high.  The server made no effort to sell us drinks.    The food.  The first thing the server told us was that they were out of the soup of the day.  Ok, fine, benefit of the doubt, it must have been excellent and super-popular, right?  We started with hummus - not my choice.  Did not meet expectations.  I ordered meatloaf.  It was surprisingly dense and rather dry - full of filler.  The mashed potatoes looked more like mashed hash browns, I don't quite know how to describe them.  The green beans had to have come from a freezer bag.  And the fried onion & jalapeno straws were completely out of place on the plate.  I probably left half of my food behind; I could have done better at home.    One of my friends ordered a wrap he seemed to enjoy, the other ordered the special - they serve prime rib Saturday evenings.  She found it under-done but it looked right to me.  For some reason we thought we might need an order of the mac and cheese.  Friends, if your mother ever made you mac and cheese, this will be a disappointment.    My glass of wine was empty for, I don't know, a good half an hour.  The server never noticed.    The facilities in the handicap bathroom I realize must have been built to code but anyone paying attention will notice that the soap dispenser, mirror, and towel dispenser are unsuitably high for someone sitting in a wheelchair.    I wish Market Grill all the best; someone has put a lot of love into the building and is trying to make it as an entrepreneur, and I appreciate that.  But they need some serious focus and refinement on the menu concept and design and a reboot on the service."", ""The restaurant smelled like a toilet.  I couldn't stand it.  My daughter and I got the meals to go and the guy put them in the same box.  She doesn't eat fish and that is what I got.  I know it's a sushi restaurant but she likes the California rolls.  I got the spicy tuna roll.  It was mediocre.  My daughter did enjoyed hers.  Will not be going back."", ""2 hours I'll never get back. Waited for the food for an hour before the bartender came back and asked if I ordered something I had not. Clearly had not even put my order in. Another hour wait to close my tab. My drink was refilled once in this 2 hour time period. The food was actually good, but wasting 2 hours of my day in an atmosphere (terribly loud at 11am) I couldn't wait to leave was far from pleasant."", ""Tried this place due to the high rating on Yelp.  This is one of the few times where I completely disagree with the general Yelp ratings.  I ordered some carne asada, shrimp, birria tacos, and a sprite.  My sprite came with a floating ant.  Ok, whatever, just asked for a new one.  Went to the restroom to wash my hand before eating.  ONE of the WORST bathrooms I've been in.  It smelled like it hadn't been cleaned in days.  Overall just dirty.  Got the tacos.  The shrimp taco was decent.  The birria was super dry and tough.  Lacking any flavor.  The carne asada was the worst.  Also dry, but tasted like old stale meat.  Gross!  Won't be coming back here again."", ""horrible food! waited for my nachos that took forever!!!! when they came they were freezing cold even the chips highly disappointed wish i could've given them  no stars they do not deserve any of my stars"", ""The food at this Qdoba was standard, but the service was horrible!

We waited and waited, and a line of 3 other couples built up before the gentleman at the first station finally sighed loudly and walked to his station."", ""Staff was very nice and helpful but we were extremely disappointed with the food.

I wont be back."", ""I went here with a group of friends during Restaurant Week and it was the complete opposite from what we were expecting. We heard that it was the best crab in Philadelphia, so why wouldn't we want to try it? As one of the guys put it, we felt like we were at \""\""Bingo Night\""\"" as soon as we walked in. No big deal tho, we had an 8pm reservation and the nine of us arrived about ten minutes early, knowing we would most likely have to wait a little. Nothing prepared us for the 45 minutes of waiting that we ended up standing through. The boys were fine, they went to the bar and made friends with what seemed to be like a regular crowd. When we were finally seated and all decided on our dishes (thank goodness), our server began The Countdown. I have never experienced this before but with every course or round of drinks he would come over and tell us \""\""Okay guys, about 7 more minutes\""\"" then return a few minutes later and say \""\""Alright well we have about 3 more minutes left\""\"" and as annoying as it was, he made us all laugh. So it was fine. I ordered the RW special that was salmon stuffed with a crab cake, and it was okay. I would have been fine if the food were on par with a 45 minute wait but it just was not worth it. The best part of the entire experience was the store bought chocolate cake we had for dessert, as they vacuumed around us."", ""Been a long time customer but really feel they've been slipping lately.

If you are looking to move soon, my advice would be to find a more professional mover way ahead of time. These guys (ICF) were available last minute and I decided to bite with the lower rate that they quoted, but do yourself a favor and plan your move ahead of time and don't think too much about any slight price difference.

Basically, the food is mediocre, which is fine, I can handle so-so tasting food. It's the experience portion of dining here that caused such a low review. I saw the good and bad reviews, but I'm fair and like to judge from my own experience, so I came in with neutral expectations. I came in with a group of six people. We ordered separately, I was the first to order. However, our food took 25 minutes, and when we asked what the holdup was, no one seemed to know or care. We did end up letting them know the service was poor, and the guy I was explaining to walked away as I was speaking! He flat out did not care.  At this point, that's just plain rude. We tried to complain to the woman managing the floor and her response was, \""\""oh.\""\""  Apparently, we weren't the only ones complaining, as we were walking out, another customer walked in to get her money back because her boyfriend has already been served and finished his food while she still hadn't gotten hers.

Not attractive.  My wife  ordered the brisket for lunch with mac and cheese and steamed veggies. I ordered the breakfast burger. My wife's entree came with more bbq sauce on the plate than meat. There were 4 skimpy pieces of brisket. It was hard to determine if the brisket was good because of the amount bbq sauce the.meat was swimming in. The bbq sauce tasted as if it was off the shelf KC's Masterpiece or Kraft.  It should have come on the side so the patron could decide how much or little was appropriate for their taste. The mac and cheese was bland and lacked the taste of cheese. Bad bad bad.  The burger I ordered was supposed to be done medium. Instead I got a lump of meat charcoal on a roll. The Sous or chef should be  ashamed of themselves for presenting this in the window for service. This is cooking 101.  The service was painfully slow.

All we ordered was tacos, a burrito, and one chicken enchilada. Simple freaking meals...I mean come on that should take 10 minutes. After the server gave us our food finally...he never came back to check if we needed anything else. We could not even flag anyone to refill our waters. The burrito and tacos were very bland but edible. The chicken enchilada was the worst enchilada I have ever had. I couldn't even eat it. The red sauce on it tasted like some old can enchilada sauce that has been sitting in their kitchen for awhile. After we were done eating we sat there for another 15 minutes before the server came to our table.

At 8:15 we came back and our table was ready.  We sat down and were promptly served a nice cool glass of ice water.  My husband ordered an Italian Kiss which is some sort of espresso mixed drink.  He said it was out of this world.  A few minutes later we were served some delicious Italian bread and butter.  The bread was wonderful.  We then placed our order after looking over the menu.   We got the escargot as our appetizer.  This was absolutely wonderful!   My husband knew he wanted the Seafood Pescatore.  I decided to have the Veal Marsala and a side of meatballs.  We enjoyed our bread until our meals were brought out.  Now my Veal Marsala was hands down the best dinner out I have EVER had.  The veal was tender, the mushrooms were delicious, and the sauce,  well I think I had dreams about it that night.  My husband's dinner was also wonderful.  He used to prepare this himself and was surprised at how fresh and tender the mussels were .  He said he would get that again.  Now the meatballs are something you HAVE to get if you go to Ralph's!!!  These were nice and firm and the gravy was wonderful!  After all this good food we had to finish off the night with a cannoli.  My husband and I both ordered one and got one to go for my Dad.

Everyone that was behind me ran to the new checkstand and I was left in the back of the line for a 2nd time. Now it took 40 minutes to check out instead of 20.

The stylists are funky, adorable, and great at what they do. I've had my hair cut here several times, had an eyebrow wax, and color, too. You're always offered a free upgrade, too, with a cut (massage, paraffin wax hand treatment, etc.) while they wash your hair. They also offer complimentary beverages and snacks, too. Both Amanda and Britta have cut and colored my hair, and I highly recommend both!  This is not a place to be rushed - if you just want to get in, cut your hair, and get out, I don't recommend this salon. They truly understand the definition of what a salon is supposed to be: a place for relaxation and pampering. Allow at least 90 minutes for your cut, but I usually make an afternoon out of it.  Be sure to make your reservation at least 1 week in advance - they get very busy and walk-ins are probably not a good idea (given that they spend a good amount of time on each client, as I mentioned above).

Highly recommend this location!"", ""Marrakesh is a total package dining experience. Not only do you get to eat authentic Moroccan cuisine, you get to enjoy a cultural experience as well.   You may have walked past Marrakesh or the surrounding streets many times without even realizing it was there, like I had prior to this visit. It's nestled on Leithgow Street just a notch off of South Street. Forget South Street or even the rest of Philadelphia for that matter. You are about to step into a different world. To enter you must ring the doorbell on the side door.   I felt more like I was going to a house, than a restaurant; especially with the shower located in the restroom on the second floor. During my entire visit, I never felt like I was at a restaurant. I felt comfortable and relaxed. Maybe eating with your hands with a towel on your lap has that effect.   I found my group of fellow Yelpers in a cozy private room.  The room had four tables with booth seating along the outskirts of the room. Ottoman like chairs took up the rest of the space for the rest of us. With such a large group in not the largest of spaces, it got loud.  Our meal started with customary hand-washing and we were even entertained twice with a belly dancer. After placing our order, the food kept flowing. The service was probably the most unobtrusive service I've ever had. As one dish was placed in front of us, another was seamlessly removed. I felt like royalty or at least someone enjoying a nice meal at someone's dinner party. The regular dining formalities I'm used to were thrown out the window, and it was fantastic!   As I'm sure you're aware, this $25 prix fixe menu has seven courses and you are welcome to BYOB. While it was a ton of food, I walked in the door absolutely starving and walked out not overly stuffed. I believe most people left absolutely full, so maybe the tip is to come in extremely hungry. Here's a little rundown of dining experience:  Course 1: Three-Salad Platter- The eggplant is phenomenal (and messy). Luckily you have some assistance from the pita to eat it. The cucumbers and bell peppers and carrots and cucumber were good, but the eggplant stole the show.   Course 2: The B'stella- As someone who doesn't normally love sweets but loves cinnamon, carbs and meat, this dish was a winner. This dish was dough filled with chicken, nuts, almonds, egg, peppers and onions. It was really hot at first, but once you cracked open the shell and let it cool down, it was easier to eat. I had some pita saved from the first course, so I found it easy to break off a piece and rest it on the pita while it cooled down. Truly a sweet-savory delight.   Course 3: Chicken- So here's where the choices began. You can either get chicken with lemon or spicy chicken. My group opted to get the spicy chicken with the cumin sauce on the side. The chicken was melt in your hands and then melt in your mouth good. The spicy sauce had a nice kick without being overly spicy to me. I still had some pita leftover so I did a little dipping with the sauce.   Course 4: Beef or Lamb- My table got a little creative here and asked for half portions of both the beef and lamb. The beef was served shish kebab style, and to be honest, not my favorite. It was a little well done, and I struggled a little to get it off the stick resulting in a pepper flying into my husband's wine glass. Sauvignon blanc tastes best with a little pepper anyways, right? The lamb was perfect. Even the non-lamb eaters thought it was delicious. It was tender and took on the flavor of the chick peas and onions without having an overwhelming lamb flavor.   Course 5: Couscous with veggies, chick peas and raisins- This was probably my least favorite dish from the main meal. It was a little blander than other couscous dishes I've tried in the past. I would have been disappointed if this was the only thing I ordered, but everything was a hit thus far in the evening. They did give us spoons at this point, so don't worry about eating the little grains with your hands.  Courses 6 & 7: Dessert- I'm assuming the tea, fruit and pastries count as the sixth and seventh courses. At this point in the evening, my bottle of wine had been consumed and I wasn't counting the dishes, and am making this assumption while referencing the menu. I'm not a tea fan so I passed. The pastries were little crisp triangles that reminded me of baklava. The fruit came out frozen was a little hard to eat. I nibbled on a strawberry and took a banana for the road since the majority of the group passed on the fruit. Perhaps the fruit was customary, but I thought a little unnecessary. If it's part of the traditional meal then no harm, no foul.    To sum it up, I had delicious food and hours of fun. It's an experience not to be missed in Philadelphia, especially if you go with an adventurous group of friends. While I couldn't imagine going to Marrakesh every Friday night, I can definitely pick a handful of occasions that would be a perfect fit."", ""1st time eating here and considering my food decisions so far this trip.  5 stars.

But he come back without the correct change, keeping all the coins..."", ""OK, I'm going to be Debbie Downer.  Awful coffee. Just awful.  Maybe that's not fair. I have yet to sample all of their fare, and perhaps it's a bad idea to fit them into the mold that Mugshots (which was gone before I arrived in Manayunk) occupied. But in the end, they call themselves a cafe, which translates into a coffee shop, moved into the location of a former coffee shop and they include baked goods and coffee on the menu, so I feel comfortable in holding them to some standard.  They were out of their banana bread. All of it. For all the flavors they described, they didn't have a single one left when I arrived. This is a significant portion of their menu, and they were out of all of it, which tells me that they have problems with keeping things in stock They had plenty of Baklava, but I'm allergic to two of the nuts they use in them, so even experimenting is a horrible idea.  There was a small child running around screaming, and I could hear arguing breaking out as I stepped through the door with my coffee. I'm not saying that without empathy, but that is never something you want your customers getting to be a part of. Even if the food had been perfect, it would have detracted from the experience  And...the coffee...I have to  go back to that. I really do. If I has handed a mug of Starbucks and was told that someone had urinated in it, and my only other option was what I had here...I would seriously have to debate that decision. This is a horrible thing to say. It's cruel, and cruel honestly isn't that much more helpful than well meaning lies. It's even more horrible to look at in the cold light of day, and determine that it's still a correct assessment. But this is someone who, during his broke college days, would drink coffee through day old grounds. Someone who used an abandoned French press that was held together with duct tape, and I couldn't finish it. Seriously, it was that bad. I don't know how they did it, and that cup was an accomplishment in of itself.  Maybe the owners are nice folk. Maybe, their Mediterranean food is really good, as other reviews seem to indicate. But they sure as shit ain't a cafe. If they want to be cheery, and have great falafel, they should do that. But dear God in heaven, who I have forsaken in so many ways, they put something on the menu so bad I am still  shocked. Combined with a lack of stock and that atmosphere, I can't possibly give this place a good rating."", ""How has this place survived???? In Germantown no less?!?!?!? The old guy behind the counter (I'm assuming he's the proprietor) was unwelcoming, surly, and kinda rude. I only ordered a cheesesteak with fried onions...admittedly without looking at the menu..and when he told me it was $8.90, I thought I jumped into a wormhole and was in South Philly at Pat's or Geno's. Let me just jump to my summation...it wasn't worth $8.90. Did they pass a new cheesesteak tax too??? It's all good and lesson learned. I will be going back to the papi stores and getting a much better cheesesteak for half the price. And they should be ashamed for fleecing people for using credit/debit cards. Hell..they even charge more for SPENDING more. Who does that????"", ""I dig Chinatown in Philly. It has always been a uniquely cool place for myself since my college days. Chinatown is an overload for the senses, from the smells, the tastes, the scenery and the hustle and bustle.  Chinatown Philly is a must stop when visiting Philadelphia. The location is very close to Old City and the historic areas.  The choices of different Pan Asian cuisines in a concentrated area are outstanding and varied. Chinatown is also evolving, there are new younger and hipper places juxtaposed with the old and classic Chinatown establishments.  My personal favorites are Dim Sum Garden, Nan Zhou Hand Drawn Noodle House, Rangoon and Terwakawa Ramen. There is also a new food court on Race Street called Chinatown Square. I have not tried this yet, but it looks very nice with a decent array of food options. For desserts there are several bubble tea and rolled ice cream shops plus A La Mouse, a Japanese-French style caf\u00e9. There are even several hair salons that have late hours and reasonable prices.  Anything is possible is Chinatown, at least food wise."", ""This was possibly the worst experience I've ever had at any restaurant.   General disappointments: They were out of orange juice, diet coke, and to go boxes. Someone waited twenty minutes to order food to go and then overheard the staff tell someone else they were out of to go boxes and couldn't accommodate any take out orders. (I think all customers would have appreciated knowing upfront that these items and services were unavailable.)  Service disappointments: While our initial interaction with our waitress was seemingly standard and friendly, I can't provide any additional positive feedback about her because we barely saw her again.The waiter who brought us our beverages informed us of their lack of diet coke and forgot 2/3 waters. We spent over 35 minutes trying to make eye contact with our waitress to get her attention - and although we made eye contact, she never came over.  We spent 45 minutes waiting for refills on water and coffee (and of course our food), while other customers who had been seated after us and were simply sitting closer to the kitchen enjoyed their food. At this point I stood up and walked over towards the kitchen to request refills, and a different waitress said she would be right with us. Ten minutes later our waitress came over with refills and said our food shouldn't be much longer.   This is now 55 minutes into our breakfast. (Just to be clear we all ordered eggs and the restaurant was not full.) While she was at our table we requested a set of utensils (since only 2/3 of our party was given a set of utensils when we were seated). In addition we requested salt and ketchup - because at this point we had high hopes our food would be arriving soon and our table was not prepared with these items unlike the other tables near us.  Finally over an hour after being seated our food arrived with unmelted cheese on the eggs and 2 packets of ketchup for our table of 3. When the waitress walked away we took the bottle of ketchup from an empty table nearby and ate our breakfast.   This was a disappointing visit to say the least. I recommend you do not visit this establishment under any circumstances."", ""I went here with my wife, our toddler son, and a friend for dinner on a Monday.  The food was good and arrived fast.  The servers (Andrea and Tom) were friendly, professional, and 100% on top of everything.  Everyone was kind to our son and understood the quirks of a kid his age.  We were all made to feel very comfortable from start to finish.  We had brussels sprouts, fries, a burger with pork belly, some craft beers (good selection), and sandwiches.    I would absolutely go here again."", ""Terrible service. Went at 1pm on a Saturday and waited 25 minutes for my order (there were 2 ppl ahead of me with normal, single sandwich orders). First, the guy didn't know how to make my sandwich (a black forest ham) and skipped to the next guy in line until he could get the girl in the back to come make it, leaving me just standing there getting passed over in line. He then put the condiments on and put on an insane amount of mustard. I didn't ask for extra, I just said mustard, thinking he'd run it back and forth 2 or 3 times and that's it. Nope, he squeezed the crap out of the bottle and completely drenched it. Then he can't work the cash register, only the girl can. Just one thing after another.    I then go out front to eat and hear a car at the drive thru placing an order on the touch screen kiosk (which is actually a really good idea), but the girl inside is telling them over the mic they have to come inside to order, that they can't place there order in the drive thru.

These little guys are like crack, and even people who hate mayo seem to love the dipping sauce   Entrees: The curried chicken salad is fantastic, though I wish they would consider serving it on different bread (it comes on two mini sandwich rolls). The BLT is also a good choice (the addition of avocado and chipotle sauce is pretty ingenious), and the club sandwich is humongous and satisfying.   Dessert: I don't even know where to start. The Brown Shugga pie is stupid good. It never would have occurred me to order it because I don't sit around thinking about brown sugar, but a friend of mine did and I ate almost the whole thing. It's ooey, gooey, rich and delicious. The key lime pie is also a spectacular pick, as is the apple crisp. I've had almost every dessert on the menu, and not one of them has been a disappointment.

The first employee to see me hardly even glanced at me, let alone attempt to greet me. He was seating 2 ladies just as I walked in so I assumed he would be right back to seat me. Bad assumption. Luckily, there was a second employee serving a table nearby who asked if I had been taken care of yet. When I told her I had not, she disappeared for a minute, only to return to reassure me that it would only be a couple of minutes longer for me to wait to be seated, presumably not by her since she was roaming around in plain sight the whole time. 5 or more minutes of standing alone in the entrance way later, I walk up to the outdoor seating area and find the first employee opening a bottle of wine at a table. After seeing him glance at me out of the corner of his eye, and still not even making eye contact or asking me what he could do for me, I stand and stare for a minute while he works, only to find that second reassuring employee finally peek through and open the door. She proceeds to ask me IF I would like to be seated. Now from where I'm standing it should have been abundantly obvious that I was waiting to be seated, but rather than admit an error on their part, she would have me believe she wasn't sure. Now I don't believe either of them meant any malice towards me, but first of all the assumption should be that someone standing with their arms crossed in the entrance should be waiting to be seated, unless they've said otherwise, and in any case shouldn't they be asked?

The majority of the time we were there they moped around behind the counter like zombies where a TV was on with the news.  Smiles were met with grumpy faces, waves from a smiling 17 month old were met with a obvious turn the other way, questions were met with short and unpleasant answers - it was depressing to say the least.  To say it nicely, the staff all need some hugs- as someone previously mentioned about Carl (again except for the blond with braided ponytail, she was pleasant). If you are looking to bring out of town guests to Ted Peter's, I don't recommend it. If the experience was like ours tonight, your guests will certainly leave with the wrong impression of the people of St. Pete."", ""1. Ambiance-- ehh, it's nice to sit by the fountains, but you have a busy road at your back, so the illusion isn't that great.  2. Rude and unfriendly staff. Every time I go, I feel like they are doing me a favor by serving me or making my coffee. 3. For a plae that boasts itself family-friendly, they sure don't seem to like kids.  4. Pretentious for nothing. It's just not as fancy as they pretend to be.  5. Food is mediocre. Coffees don't taste like coffee. The young girls who work there aren't good baristas. Desserts are lousy. I have never had anything that tastes indulgent. They try to copy the style of the French bakeries in the area and even Whole Foods, but the taste falls flat. They tout their Triple Berry cake as the greatest dessert in town. I'd rather buy Whole Food's berry chantilly cake. At least it's fresh from there.""]",8

My therapist was able to get all the painful knots out of my back. I could already feel the difference before I even walked out the door. My husband was so relaxed during his massage that he fell asleep. The atmosphere and decor were my favorite part of this experience. The low lighting and comfy chairs really promote relaxation. I have been to many different spas in many cities and the atmosphere here is always what I look for in a spa but rarely find. I wished they had light hors d'oeuvres and cold water option. The water was room temperature. Would definitely recommend this spa to a friend and we will definitely visit again next time we are in New Orleans."", ""Good bagels, but they can NEVER get an order right.  We live in NJ so when you ask for Taylor Ham and cheese you think they would be able to handle this.    Instead I get a ham and cheese sandwich, or an egg, ham and cheese sandwich.

Take me to Citizens Bank Park!  Buy me some cheesesteaks and BBQ!  Crab fries, soft pretzels;  Ump, what did you do!?!   I am a huge fan of baseball. It is one of my loves and my favorite sport, by far. Even though I am a huge Braves fan ( oh, shut up ), I enjoy watching any team play. However, when the Braves come to Philly, I meet them at Citizen's Bank Park.   Having lived from one corner of the USA to the next and being an extensive traveler, I have been to many stadiums around the USA, including Philly's previous Veteran's Stadium. Citizen's Bank Park is, without a doubt, the most sophisticated baseball stadium I have visited. There are three floor levels, from the main floor to the third floor you can easily reach it via an open outdoor escalator.  There are also elevators for folks who choose to use them.  I've entered through different gates and I never fail to see amusements for the kids. The park staff is very friendly to all who enter their gates, but for the kiddies, they have slides, pitching balls, face painting and so much more! http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/phi/ballpark/not_your_typical_ballpark.jsp#kids My granddaughter was picked to be on first base last year and got to stand along with the Phillies first baseman, Ryan Howard, she also has an autographed ball by him!  She was on TV and thank heavens my son, who is a huge Phillies fan, taped the game!   This stadium has more concession stands and eateries than I have ever seen at any stadium, be it football or baseball. You want food, they've got it!  Citizen's Bank Park food offerings, redefines Ballpark cuisine!   I have tried most of these places and be it a cheesesteak, crab fries, kielbasi, hot dogs, piled high sandwiches or BBQ, you will leave here filled with satisfaction. Bull's BBQ is the largest grill in all of major league baseball's stadiums. It has an outdoor picnic area and grills and BBQ's anything from turkey, pork, beef and sausages to chicken. http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/phi/ballpark/concessions.jsp   In honor of the recently deceased Harry Kalas, they had paid homage to him with Harry The K's, which has served beverages and foods from finger food to an upscale menu. McFadden's which is a sit down eatery and Sports bar is conveniently accessed from both inside and outside of the enclosed park.   I am there to watch the ballgame, food is brought to you, as well as beverages, constantly! If and when I do venture away from my seat to grab a bite, I still do not miss the game, thanks to the numerous screens and shouts from the stands.   Seating is comfortable with a lot of leg room, wide screen TVs adorn this open stadium and beautiful displays of a lit up replica of the Liberty Bell, which rings every time the Phillies hit a home run. Guests also enjoy a fantastic view of the Center City skyline. Oh, by the way, that is real grass on the field.  Tickets can be purchased in advance and online.  This year  they have a new package that includes your ticket for the game and a $10.00 food voucher than can be used at any stand or eatery.  They sell for $32.00 -$34.00.  One thing that I will never forget and that is how badly I wanted Chipper Jones to autograph a baseball, for my Grandson.  He refused, right in front of my grandson. Later, as we sat behind the dugout, we watched a line form and who came out, Chipper Jones to sign at least 20 balls. Since then I have bought his baseball and bat, but it killed me to do so. As we were walking towards the parking lot, after the game left out, we passed the area where the Phillies players were leaving, Jim Thome got out of his Hum V and signed quite a few balls.  I gave mine to my son, since he is a big fan, but I will never forget those two episodes.     The way I look at it, if you do not find love for this stadium, it is because you are jealous or envious.   Every time I walk into Citizen's Bank Park, I am loving it and knowing that my next few hours will be full of good times and good eats. Batter up!  Play ball!"", ""Blend recently catered our wedding and it was absolutely amazing. Blend was always our first choice for catering and managing our wedding because I work for them. Working for them has be great so we knew our wedding experience would be just that!   Everything with our wedding went off without a hitch. The food was so incredible and the staff was so helpful! We had a great time making our custom menu with Josh and Whitney. I'm around our food all the time but my husband isn't. It was fun for me to go though this experience with him. We were engaged for almost two years so I changed our menu quite a bit. Josh and Whitney were so patient with us and that helped out so much.  We had about 15 different passed light and heavy appetizers and two big stationed items. It gave our guests the choice to have food brought to them or they could go to the food. I loved that we could have all of my favorite items at our wedding. Not having to pick one or two. It would of been very hard to pick just a few. They made it easy for us and said pick all of them!   Our guest raved about all of the food and loved that we had it going all night. Drink some, eat some! I could hear people saying \""\""oh look more food, I haven't tried that one yet\""\""   The staff made the whole night run so smoothly. They kept the reception clean and tidy. We still hear how great and smooth everything went.   I've never seen our events from the perspective of \""\""The Bride\""\"". It was great to see that and experience the company this way.

Large selection of some of the best in the city, the apple fritter here is the winner, but you can't really go wrong. One of my favourite things about this place is that it is open almost all of the time, so you don't need to get there before midday (most days) to get your fill.  It's also next to both Ted Drewes if you're a fan (i'm pretty ambivalent about Ted Drewes, it's fine but no more) and the excellent Aya Sofia, so if you really want to pig out this is a good part of town to be in!"", ""This place is a dirty hole.

I had a hard time deciding what to order and after she questioned my taste, she recommended the salmon along with a perfectly paired white wine. I have to say, best salmon ever! I'm from Seattle, so I know salmon. The meal was fantastic and her service was stellar!

I will be back next time I am in Tucson!"", ""Today marked the end of my first month of rowing at RowZone. I could not be more happy with my experience thus far. At my first class, I met with the instructor, Laura, who spent time going over the ERG machine with me and showing me proper rowing form. She continued to check in with me throughout the class to see how I was doing and kept me motivated to keep pushing myself.   While I have not taken classes from all of the instructors at RowZone, from my experience I can tell you that Laura is phenomenal. She structures her classes to be a mixture of rowing and strength training, with five 5-minute sets of rowing and a \""\""break\""\"" of weight/resistance band training in between each set.  It's a tough workout, especially when Laura throws sprints into the mix, but that's why you're going, right? In one month I have lost 8 lbs and can notice considerably more muscle definition in my shoulders, arms and legs. In addition to great classes, the trainers are happy to share advice on other fitness topics from nutrition to exercises you can do at home. The online scheduler RowZone uses makes it easy to find classes that fit into your schedule, just be sure to be considerate and don't cancel at the last minute or fail to show up at all as there can sometimes be a wait list of other rowers who would like to get in the class.  One last point I'd like to make is the sense of community that RowZone fosters. While the quality of your workout is ultimately up to you, the support you receive from your peers is immensely valuable. When you feel like there's no way your legs can push you through those last 5 minutes of rowing, all you have to do is look to a neighbor for motivation to keep going."", ""We had a great experience enjoying happy hour here!

I decided to bring my phone in at lunch and pick it up in the afternoon. I had never been before, but when I went in, the store was very clean, well organized and pleasant to be in! Justin said he'd get started on my phone right away so I decided to wait for it. It was repaired in about 20 minutes and they even threw in a glass protector screen for free.  Their products come with warranties and are clearly high quality. The people at the store are pleasant and helpful! If you find a lower price for the same repair service, I have a feeling they'd be willing to match it.  So glad I got my phone fixed instead of paying an exorbitant amount for a replacement!"", ""Good food, but to me it's not worth the horrible service or the rude staff, and they only take cash or checks and there's not even a sign at the front stating so; the sign is at their cash register all the way in the back on a wall not facing the dining room.

Okay well if we had a reservation wouldn't we be first to sit down? We didn't care if the chef wasn't ready we just wanted to sit down order drinks and have some appetizers. We were then seated and our server Ivan came over very promptly which was nice. After he got our first round of drinks this is where things went down hill.   We ordered some sushi, simple sushi. Salmon, and shrimp. We ordered 2 rolls, a crunch roll and a shrimp tempura roll. He brought out yellowtail, tuna and 2 veggie rolls. I kindly said that the food wasn't ours and that wasn't what we ordered. He told me that it was and that I was wrong. So I asked to see the sushi paper because maybe I marked the wrong thing. And then he said he threw the paper away but he took the sushi away with a HUGE attitude and said he would go try and find the paper. Well our group could see him in the back area and he pulled the paper out of his apron and came over and said oh yeah I guess it was my fault I brought you guys the wrong stuff.... Okay that's what we tried explaining! The stuff finally comes out and tasted perfect! So then some of us ordered the teppan and we got our miso soup and then once that was done we got our salad. None of us had forks and I'm pretty sure maybe 1 out the 9 of us knew how to use chopsticks so I asked for forks and he said yeah no problem. Well we waited out 10 minutes until we saw him again and couldn't find any other servers to ask for their help so we ended up just eating with our fingers. We finally see Ivan and asked for forks again and he said, \""\""do you honestly need them right now? Your food isn't being cooked!\""\"" EXCUSE ME! I was so furious that he would even come back with such attitude. All of the girls needed forks and so we told him, yes we need them now. I almost got up to go find them myself! Anyways, chef comes, food turned out good and no Ivan to be found for about 30 minutes. So 2 girls in our group asked for boxes, myself included, and it took him about 15 minutes to get them so I ended up eating the last bit of food I was going to take home. So when he brought my box I said, \""\""I'm sorry, I don't need the box anymore I finished what I was going to take home, but thank you!\""\"" (very politely) He then came back with \""\""ok well maybe if I take your plate away you'll stop changing your mind\""\"" WHAT IN THE HELL!!!! At this point I was done trying to be nice. After2 and half hours I was so glad to be leaving! Ivan was so rude to ALL of the girls in our group! I hope if we go back, which we probably won't, that Ivan will not be there. I always try and give people the benefit of the doubt and maybe he was having a bad day, but if your day is that bad, don't come into work and be mean and rude to your customers. I work with the public and believe me, it's hard to always please everyone. But it's unacceptable to be rude to people!!"", ""Without a doubt one of the worst experiences I've ever had my life was presenting myself at the emergency room at Temple Hospital. Five hours before I even saw a triage nurse. Then I was told I had a life-threatening infection I needed emergency surgery.   They parked me in a room where I sat for two hours constantly begging for a glass of water. I kept asking what was going on I needed somebody to explain things to me, they said in a minute in a minute, we're waiting for the doctor.  I finally came to the realization this is not the place I need it to be and got up and left against medical advice.  The next day I went to Bryn Mawr Hospital and had my surgery there along with a two-week hospitalization. I was treated so well I felt almost as if I was a guest at the Ritz Carlton.  Dr Floros saved my life. It turns out I had a MRSA infection and had I waited another 48 hours I would've been dead.

The only logical explanation is this is a coke from a customer that left and they folded their receipt and tossed it in their drink.

So I let the owner Angela do my nails. The first time was ok. Then the second time she did them the gel polish (which she talked me into getting instead of regular polish) started to chip within a day. I called and complained, she redid the polish and again within one or two days it was chipping. Now my nails look at mess. I don't trust her to correct the problem.

The nail tech came over to look and she pressed the clumps back down and painted right back over the mess (didn't even keep the paint in the lines) then slathered so much varnish over the train wreck that it was literally dripping down my finger. After my nails were dry enough to leave,  another tech rang me up and the receipt had no place for a tip.  When I asked,  he told me I had to pay tips in cash...

I ate here for lunch today, saying that so hopefully a member of the staff reads this and remembers me, I ordered the dry hot pot and my gf ordered fried dumplings and the cold noodles with chili oil and we shared each other's food. The mushrooms in my dish were impossible to cut even with a knife and the rest of the vegetables had a freeze dried feel to them being the consistency of bark. The pork was a bit rubbery and only had flavor from the oil draped over everything that seemed under seasoned as well and definitely tasted old. This was labeled in the menu as a 10/10 spicy rating, it was at most a 2. I didn't bother saying anything because of how rude the waiter/host was, but I'll get to that. The rice was cold and clumped together in chunks that led me to understand that it was previously microwaved. The dumplings looked ok, but the dough was undercooked and the sauce was just soy sauce that had no care whatsoever put into it. Her noodles were very bland and whoever prepared them obviously doesn't care about their food. The noodles had the same flavor deprived oil from my dish in it, just disappointing really. This type of food is supposed to be robust and I've eaten at a ton of places across the country and internationally that do care about what the put out. This place doesn't care anymore. The man that seated us was incredibly rude the entire time. He huffed and puffed and stomped his feet when I asked for the real Chinese menu instead of the Americanized Chinese menu. And, they used to throw shade if you asked for the Americanized menu, now it's the opposite. After we were done we both had a decent amount of food left and I decided to take it to feed to the raccoons that come around my house. They look cool and I like to feed them. Anyway, the take out container was dirty from previous food in it! I was blown away, especially when I pointed it out and the rude person pretending to be a man grabbed it out of my hand and stormed, literally stormed off before I was even half way through my sentence. I was calm the whole time, not sure what this guys deal is. Then came back with the same container that he washed! He washed the dirty container that should never have been used in the first place and thought that was acceptable. I will never go here again and I hope they go out of business so no one has to be punished by this Handy Nasty food.

My friend, Alex, went back the next morning to try and find it. (I was at work, but kept a close eye for any changes on the map via laptop).   He went up to the brew brothers, and spoke to the manager (bald with a beard).   \""\""I was the manager that was on last night, and I assure you there was no phone found last night.\""\"" My friend then walked down to security, they hadn't found it.  Meanwhile I was incessantly using the \""\""play sound\""\"" function via my laptop. At some point Alex was called. Someone said \""\""hello\""\""... then hung up.   Alex went back to brew brothers and was like \""\""I know it's in there.\""\""   \""\""Ummmm... alright let me check\""\"". He came out with it in hand, and was acting sketchy. \""\""It was making noise and scaring the employees so we turned it off.\""\"""", ""I wish I could give this zero stars, this gave my husband and kid a really really bad stomach ache after eating here.

I am surprised by all the reviews that were under three stars, because this restaurant was a definite hit for me when I used to work at Boeing as a contractor.  I came into this restaurant at least once a week, Their gyro's are huge chocked full of the gyro meat and their fries are always hot and fresh! If you are a Christian, they always have free bibles they give away, in addition to different pro christian charities. If you are you not part of the christian persuasion, this is easy to ignore, simply because of the good food!  I am so upset that I don't live close to this establishment though. Would love to come in the future!"", ""I have had several bad experiences with the Montgomery county SPCA. I never thought to look up reviews until now.  The woman who I believe may have been previously employed there pretty much nailed it. A few years ago I went to one of the branches trying to rescue a severely underweight Neapolitan mastiff. They told me verbatim that they wouldnt cat or dog test her and they go by the typical behavior of the breed.  They said it was a liability if one of the dogs or cats in the meet got injured.  That being said, the dog wouldn't be adopted out to a home with cats.  They also told me under no circumstances would they adopt out a pit bull mix to a home with other animals  That left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. They weren't even willing to work with me to save this dog.  This weekend we stopped into a different branch and fell in love with one of the pit bull mixes they had there.  Her kennel card said she was good with kids and dogs as she previously lived with both. She had been turned in about 48 hour prior to our visit due to the fact that her family was moving and couldn't bring her.  We Inquired about her at the reception area where they were MORE than friendly and eager to give us as much information as possible.  They had said she actually hadnt  had a behavior evaluation by a manager yet and that they expected that to happen within the next few days.  They also made a comment that since she was an am staff mix she would require an application. I found that to be a bit weird and wondered to myself if either of the 2 small dogs that tried to rip my head off would require the same. So, unable to control my excitement, I called today to see if she had her behavior test and to set up a meet with my resident dog. The woman said she had failed her evaluation and was no longer up for adoption.  She wasn't allowed to give me any additional information. We were heart broken. I feel like maybe if we were informed of her issues we could decide if it was something we were able to rehabilitate. I didn't understand why she had a kennel card with her information if she hadnt even been evaluated. Again, the staff there were more than willing to help and very pleasant. Even the woman on the phone thanked me for calling in.  I love the SPCA and all they stand for, but I feel like the Montgomery county SPCA is less tolerant of any kind of behavior issues and are more willing to euthanize for space rather than work with a dog whos issues may be minor."", ""Old-school style barbershop with modern conveniences.

Breanna is an incredible coordinator--so lovely and warm to work with.   After researching several venues, we decided that the Riviera Mansion was a great fit for us. The menu looked fantastic, the staff was super accommodating, and Breanna really worked with us and our wedding planner to help design the vision and \""\""look\""\"" we were going for. We said we wanted everything to be outdoors...no problem. We said we wanted string lighting and chandeliers in the trees...no problem. We wanted to use all the ourdoor lawn for cocktail hour, dinner and dancing, have a live band and a dj, sweetheart table and cake table. If we dreamed it up, Breanna and the staff were all hands on deck to work to accommodate it.   A few months before the event, we did our tasting for the menu. And the food was OUTSTANDING! Really great portions, delicious flavors and beautiful presentation. And I will say that the food was consistent from tasting to the actual wedding, and our guests RAVED about it. We even had people asking for seconds! Wedding food is never something that typically stands out, but I can say the steak and the fish options we had were absolutely delicious. And again, Breanna and the kitchen were able to accommodate when I requested that the fish needed to be wild and sustainably caught--again no problems.  I would be remiss if I did not mention the Food & Beverage manager, Eli. Eli was such a sweetheart--making sure we thought about everything during the preparation walk through meeting and that we were happy the day of and throughout the event. You can tell he takes great pride and joy in his job and venue.  Breanna, Eli and team were so flawless in organizing everything that we honestly had nothing to worry about--working with this venue was stress free, which made for two very happy brides.

I normally find it hard to narrow down the options, I normally ask the wait staff bc there always seems to be a few dishes that rise above the others. The sorghum bacon is always pretty impressive and a crowd pleaser and I've definitely ordered a few different versions of the Dutch baby. Happy brunching!"", ""If you're entertained by gambling as an end in itself - if you enjoy spending an evening actually trying to win some money - Western Village is really one of the best places in Reno.  For example, there's a poker pay table \""\""10/7 Double Bonus Poker.\""\"" that, if played perfectly, returns 100.7% of your money. Since casinos rarely like to lose money, it's extremely rare to run across. I found it at Western Village, on the 50-play machines. And they weren't even advertising it - they just slipped it in.  Sadly, I guess too many people caught on, and they eventually reduced it to 9/6/5 - which is still an almost 98-percent payback. Good enough that you really don't need to walk in expecting to lose.  Same goes for the tables - you're usually going to find pretty much the least restrictive rules that you can find in a Nevada casino.  This place doesn't have a lot of glitz or glamour, it doesn't have much in the way of comps, but it's a great place to gamble."", ""It's been quite some time since I first reviewed New Day Meadery, and I can honestly say the experience here is the same if not better than even a few years ago.

We recently hit up their anniversary bottle release of gin barrel-aged Shelby Blue Ribbon, for which my wife and I were first in line. Naturally we purchased the maximum amount of bottles of this special elixir, as I believe it was approximately 3 years ago when this was last available.

The pull was clean and the flavor was good. I was also blown away that they offer hookah with fruit, since it can be difficult to find. Between the hookah and the IPA beers, we left Aladdin very happy. We were upset that we didn't find it sooner during our trip.  I would be remiss if I didn't also mention the diverse crowd at Aladdin. It was nice to see that.

Perlis was everything a proper men's clothing store should be. A gentleman in an impeccable suit helped me find the perfect French cuff American-made shirt.

Helping me find the perfect shirt would be enough reason to go back, but going above and beyond to really save the day makes me want to wax poetic about this place."", ""This place was fantastic. The pizza rolls are not similar in shape to those frozen things; they're actually made like cinnamon rolls, with pizza dough instead of pastry and sauce/fillings instead of cinnamon sugar. They're amazing.  I got one of the daily specials, which was puppy drum (fish) with a side of pasta. I wasn't a huge fan of the fish, but I think I just don't like puppy drum as much as I expected to. It was prepared fine, though. The pasta is obviously homemade and the marinara is delicious.  My boyfriend got a dish that I can't remember the name of, but it was basically pasta, shrimp, and mushrooms in a rich butter sauce. Shrimp Diane maybe? It was very good. I actually ended up eating his leftovers, and I might get that next time.   The bread is good, though very full of sesame seeds, so beware if that's not your thing. We finished with the tiramisu. The flavor was great, but the texture was too wet for my taste. Again, it's more a matter of taste than anything they did wrong. We'll definitely try the \""\""cherrymisu\""\"" next time, which is tiramisu but with cherry juice in place of coffee.   The service was fantastic, the place was clean, it was easy to park.   However, my absolute favorite thing was hearing one of the cooks tell another, \""\""I'll be back, I'm going to go peel some shrimp.\""\"" I love a place that uses fresh seafood and does things without cutting corners.

Sever comes over tells our friend their out of what she wanted. Would've been nice to know before everyone stared receiving their food. But she got to pick whatever she wanted for free, not bad. Everyone is now done with their meals and My friend beside me never got her food. By this time the restaurant is basically empty. The manager comes over and just goes \""\"" what did you have\""\"" my friend told her then she just walked away. No apology. Nothing. Her food finally comes out and she asks our sever why was she just now receiving her food? He replies with \""\""oh you know the kitchen gets slammed, things happen\""\"" our jaws nearly hit the floor. Granted they comped her meal. But everything was poorly executed and the manager never stopped by to apologize, our server never apologized.    I guessed they assumed that they were gonna go down in flames cause they thought passing out a $5 off coupon for next time would do anything. Safe to say we spent 3 hours in a restaurant for a lousy experience. The food was decent but not worth it. Like the saying goes \""\"" you can fix lousy food with great service but you can't fix lousy service with great food\""\"" and we don't ever, ever plan on coming back here. I get that it was Valentine's Day and it was busy, completely understood but it's the mangers job to smooth over the situation. Comping the food is great but that doesn't fix anything. Get it together macaroni grill."", ""For starters, there is a really good atmosphere. The table where we sat had cushions to sit on - it reminded me of what I might see in a traditional East Asian home. Our service was prompt and fabulously delivered by waitress Air. Our family had an assortment of appetizers and entrees. We thought the red curry and pad Thai dishes were the best we'd had, ever. We also ordered the spicy noodle dish with tofu, which was a major crowd pleaser at our table and definitely was as beloved as the pad Thai and red curry. The coconut flavor of the red curry shines through, the shrimp were perfectly cooked and plump. We also had coconut ice cream with fried banana (shaped like pillows in phyllo dough, or similar) for dessert. Best coconut ice cream *ever* - creamy, awesome coconut flavor, and there are seemingly soft chunks of coconut in the ice cream as well. That being said, my sister who doesn't especially like coconut still really enjoyed the dessert. We all really enjoyed the fried banana. Overall, we so look forward to going back!"", ""I love this place!! They have really creative and affordable vegan/ vegetarian options, including vegan pastries. And their coffee so amazing."", ""This company is difficult to deal with.  They promise more than they deliver.  The quality of their work is inconsistent.  I would not recommend them."", ""I am an Italian southern girl who grew up on Italian creole food, thus, finding great Spanish food has been hard for me.  This restaurant has the best authentic Mexican/Spanish food in the greater New Orleans area.  The food is cooked fresh in an open kitchen that smells so good it will have your stomach growling.  The menu used to be written in Spanish however, they switched to pictures and an English menu which has only allowed me to explore Spanish cuisine further.  My husband and I are addicted to the horchata drinks.  He loves the fajitas, I love their enchiladas.  I chose a red sauce over my enchiladas instead of green which the hostess explained the green sauce was hotter but I found the red sauce to be spicy to perfection.   We placed our order to go because we love to eat at home, however they have a huge dining area and flat screen t.v. with soccer playing last time we went.  If your looking for real, authentic Mexican/Spanish cuisine then I recommend this restaurant."", ""Very small quaint place in cute downtown Narberth.  Authentic Thai food which you can customize the spiciness and the portions are large.  The owner Coco is from Thailand and brings her love of her food to her cooking.  Prices are comparable to most main line Thai restaurants.  Nice variety of choices on the menu."", ""OK, I have to confess, Jimboy's tacos are about as greesy as it gets, probably as bad for you as it gets, but they are my guilty pleasure.  I love them!  It's true love.  I can't help it.  It's a relationship that started back in high school when I used to get brain-dead-stoned after school and then go to Jimboys to eat all the tacos I could stuff down my throat. There is something about the greesy meat and cheese with the shell that's covered in parmasean cheese; it's soooo incredible.  It's my \""\""White Castle.\""\""  I no longer indulge in the Ganja substance abuse beforehand, but the tacos are almost as good without it."", ""I could not be happier with choosing the Riviera Mansion for our wedding venue. My husband and I met in Santa Barbara so it was only fitting that we got married in a place that reminded us of where it all began. One of the things I loved about the venue is it's rich history in Santa Barbara and how beautifully the architecture and gardens photograph. The staff at the Riviera Mansion are top notch and really created a premium experience for us, from the first email we sent to Breanna to the walk-through, the tasting, rehearsal and the wedding day itself! We felt so well taken care of throughout the night- they checked in on my husband and I and our parents throughout the night to ensure we had our favorite drink in hand, got to taste all of the appetizers by putting a special plate at our dinner table and kept our champagne topped off for all of the toasts. One of the big selling points for us was that the venue included a lot of the basics like catering, bar, dinner rentals, bride & groom suites, and different ceremony and reception sites. I was grateful to be able to get ready, take photos, have a light lunch before the wedding all onsite. The venue itself is BEAUTIFUL and so dreamy. It was just the right amount of space and with all of the different room kept things interesting for our guests and allowed people to spread out across the different rooms and patios. I would highly recommend the Riviera Mansion to anyone looking for a classy, iconic and romantic wedding venue in Santa Barbara.""]",24

I cannot speak highly enough about my favorite dish I've had which is the 'Vito the mooch' sandwich I had it several times and think about it on a weekly basis when going to have a sandwich.

I was spending the evening at the bar having a great time with my girlfriend and the other patrons. I was there for several hours and decided it was time to leave. As I walked out three security guards approached me and starting harassing me. They told me to leave (which I was on my free will already)... I questioned why they were harassing me and they threw me on the ground, improperly handcuffed me (which is illegal),screamed at me, called me a \""\""fat mother f'er\""\"" \""\""Bitch\""\"" \""\""that's what you get\""\"" among other obscenities, and proceeded to call the pinellas county sheriffs department. All this happened on a public sidewalk 20 yards away from the business. They left bruises and marks all over my body, injured my knee to the point I'm limping, ripped my shirt, and broke my glasses. They made up a story that I tried to hit a bartender (mind you I tipped 25% and was having a good night. Plus I'm not even a violent person). The police showed up shortly after all this... I was illegally detained and released after they concluded I did nothing wrong...I was trespassed verbally from the property due to this and asked to leave. If I truly assaulted someone like the security claimed I did I would have been arrested. They're aggressive and had no right to assault me.   I called after this all happened and asked to speak to the owner to try and comprehend what happened. Brooke answered the phone. I asked her why I was assaulted and I asked for the video of what happened. She responded with \""\""you've been trespassed and get a subpoena if you want the video\""\"". She hung up on me afterwards. I called back and at that point she told me she'll get me arrested for harassment if I call again... They know they're wrong. Just be careful going here...

I am writing this review even before I head to the restaurant for dinner tonight and believe me when I say this, that I would never end up eating here if the majority of the birthday girl's party did not insist on eating at Han Dynasty just because she likes the food.\u00a0   It takes 2 phone calls and talking to 3 people to get a reservation at this restaurant, that itself is a turn off. The first lady I speak to is flat out rude when I call asking to make a dinner reservation for tonight \""\""We're all booked for tonight and not giving out any reservations\""\"" she says before hanging up on me. I call back and a second lady answers and I say I need a reservation for 15 people at 9:30 and she asks for how long? WTF??? \""\""For however long it takes 15 adults to get done with dinner that's how long\""\"" She responds saying they close at 10PM and the lady has no clue what day it is and they are open later on Friday's and finally agrees to give me a reservation.\u00a0   It is absolutely appalling when people working in the hospitality industry are rude. If you can't be courteous to your guests consider a different profession. I understand you are in the university city area and have to, more often that you like, deal with students but that by no means is an excuse for ill-treating your guests.\u00a0   If you expect a 20% tip from anyone they expect to be given a good experience right from the time they call you to make a reservation."", ""I usually call before coming in so they can have my order ready to go.

My polish stays on until she takes it off the next week (which considering what I put my nails through is unbelievable). I know I just shot myself in my beautifully pedicured  foot, as I will never be able to get in with her again.

We moved to the other side of the restaurant (still outside) and the kids made there way over to us and continued playing. We couldnt get away. We went to a table inside. Food was terrible. Steak was fatty and overcooked and mashed potatoes werent fresh. The waitress was about the only thing good about this place. She agreed on the steak and took it back.

Upon walking in the manager greets us and asks where we were from. A friend of mine, and the only one amongst us from Louisiana, responded. The manager came back with a comment about my friend being from a trailer park when he heard where he was from (he's never lived in a trailer). So immediately not a good impression.  We get seated, the manager tells us our server is going to be male, a female shows up. Clearly bad communication. The waitress greets us and asks how we're doing and I return the question. She responds that she has been better. I'm a server and I know from experience, even if you're having a bad day, you don't show it or just come right out and say it.  The waitress suggests homemade hurricanes to drink. Two of the people in my party decide to try one. They were horrible. They were so potent u could hardly drink them. They definitely needed to add a little juice. Some cornbread with a honey sauce came to the table. It was very good! As an appetizer, the 4 of us split a sampler platter.... Which took 25 minutes to hit the table. The shrimp were good. The catfish was plain. The salmon patties were just OK. The red beans were pretty good. The turnip greens were very bitter. Overall not impressed.  For our entrees: One friend got the rib eye, it was undercooked. His wife got a blackened fish. The only reason the fish was \""\""blackened\""\"" was because it was burnt. My fianc\u00e9 got the jambalaya and catfish plate. The jambalaya was decent but the catfish was again plain. I had the shrimp scampi.

I tried the molecule mule and it was nothing but simple syrup and lime, for $10. You can get the same thing at Marsh for less.

After being picked up, we waited for about 20min to wait for the other bus to come then about 20 people were transferred to our bus. By the time we really started the tour, it was an hour after the pick up time.   Payment issue - I called about the discount I'll get if I reserve online. The woman told me to do it otherwise I can't get it when paying in person. So I did it. But, then the driver, half way into the tour, said now everyone please line up to pay. He used a tiny portable credit card machine to process everyone's card. It was slow  SLOW! The bus was full that day and it was 90 degrees out. It took him about 45min to get everything done plus he was confused about two groups of people who happened to have the same last name.   Really? It's 2013 people! The company can't take payment online or over the phone?  Why ask your customer to waste valuable time?   Though I had the email proving I've paid online. I was told that it simply reserved my seats and wasn't the actual payment. So paid AGAIN and of course got charged TWICE! It has been over a week and I haven't got the refund.   Because of this delay, when we got to the second plantation, we had about a little over an hour left because the driver said we  must leave at 5.    He told us to go straight to the big house but gave us the WRONG time when the tour would start. So everyone waited about 15 minutes in line AGAIN instead of just enjoying the beautiful garden at Oak Alley. (The tour is boring and the stories aren't interesting. I'd recommend people just spend all the time in the garden) By the time we came out, it was almost time to get on the bus and head back to the French Quarter. So Disapppinting.

I said this is not what they had served me for the past 5 years and I never had requested a special order before.  I also asked what they had done to the phenominal soft tacos? They were usually served in a soft warm flour tortilla and had moisture and flavor. Tonight they were stale and crisp and the filing was bland.

I tried covering them up with the bbq sauces however even those were strange tasting. The sweet was pure molasses. The house was the only one I could tolerate.  I think they need to hire a cook that has tastebuds. We tried the apple crumble pie for desert and we even threw that away as it had no sweetness at all and no texture.  The price was crazy.

I sent the pictures of the box with a Capri Sun package beside of it to show that a boxed blow dryer would not fit in the box.  Have not heard anything several days later.  Very frustrating!! Horrible customer service and very offensive. They accused me and the post office of stealing items."", ""I won't be going back.  The chips were shiny with oil, and not tasty.  The salsa was bland, and made out of canned tomatoes.  Entrees come with no sides at all.  They are ordered separately, and can't be ordered for one person.  Everything but baked beans was a 2-person portion.  That is just stupid.  As a result, we ended up getting salads, which were uninspiring.  Also, mine listed avocado as an ingredient, yet none was to be found.  The food wasn't bad, but neither was it good.  This area has far better restaurants.  Avoid!"", ""Horrible service. Sat there for 20 minutes before server finally came out. Claims no one told her we were there. Guess she couldn't see us. Had to get something quick because we had tickets to the playhouse theater. Got to the restaurant with more than an hour to spare. She took our order and said she would be back with our bread. She never came back. Another 30 minutes passed, so we decided to leave. Just as we were leaving our food showed up. They couldn't believe we were leaving.  Felt good to stick it to them for a 55 minute wait. Luckily the playhouse is a short distance away."", ""This place has the worst customer service. My friend and I went to jack in the box at 12:30AM on a Wednesday night. We were the only ones there and I went to order my food and said okay so that's it for that order, we're gonna have a second order and he said we actually can't do two orders and I understand that during a rush or something but we were the only ones there. So I said that and said well we are literally the only people in the drive thru, like what difference does it make? And he was like you can come in the store and do two orders and I was wasn't going to do that so I told him I would drive around again even though it was completely unnecessary. So I got my food and went around again (still no cars had been through the drive thru) and ordered a single coke. Not even food which made it more annoying. But anyways. So we got to the window and wanted to get more fries because they gave me a super small amount in my meal but we weren't gonna complain because we were already over this experience. So we were just gonna buy them. And so we asked if we could add on fries and she said no!! She literally said \""\""uhmmmmmm no\""\"". And I was speechless. Needless to say. Screw them."", ""Took the youth group out for a fun night..definitely won't return.    Everything was gross.   Tables were unclean.   Told that food would be done in 30 minutes.   Definitely took almost an hour.   Balls were nasty.  Seriously.  Everything about this place is disgusting.  The chairs are all tore up.   The mini golf needs to be updated.  I went up to ask about about bumpers (we were playing crazy bowl) they refused.  Said that we were too old.  I have 11-13 year olds.  The two lanes next to us had bumpers up and plenty of adults in their 30-40's but because they had 1-2 kids the were allowed to have the bumpers up.   Seriously.  We will never be back.  None of the kids want to come here any more.  Swing around fun town it is.  The icing on the cake was the \""\""help\""\"" at the front desk.  All 5 guys were just sitting around.  One guy checked us out but had to be a real jerk.  My husband went up to buy 7 mini golfs..one of the workers said \""\""you gonna pay for that?\""\""  Seriously?"", ""When I think about the time I spent waiting for the server to arrive, for a drinkable cup of coffee to replace the one that tasted like it has been brewed with a goat's hoof, and to digest the hard lump of cheese and egg that was my breakfast, I really wish I had chosen instead to stand in the line-up at Sugarbowl."", ""Who gets in fights at a recreational hockey game you ask; boys. Most of the teams are made up of men trying to compensate for their shortcomings. Bar is never open. One young ref is the absolute worst & is partial to his buddies.

If I was paying money to play a sport & had someone like that enforcing my game I'd want to put him out there on the rink."", ""Top 10 worst restaurant experiences of all time!  Stopped in for lunch this Sunday afternoon. I had seen the reviews about bad service here but was driving and figured WTH, let me give it a try. I am sorry i did.   I walk in and the toothpick chewing attendant is sitting on a stool. Sees me but continues to play with his phone. After an awkward 2 min staring contest motions me to 'sit where ever' wave. Brings over a cracked plastic glass with his palm covering and touching the rim of my glass and warm pitcher of water. Ordered boneless Chicken Korma was brought out by a waiter in a small cereal bowl with another small cereal bowl of microwaved rice in which we had his thumb. I wanted to walk out but honestly felt sorry for the guy given the restaurant only had one other party of three dinning on a Sunday Afternoon. Food was horriable. Instead of Chicken Korma i was given what tasted like Chicken Makhni curry over spiced and over salted to look like Chicken Korma. Waiter disappears and emerged with three fingers on a plate plopped it down and disappeared forever. I ate about a quarter of the meal and literally felt like throwing up. The meat was a mixture of white and dark meat left over from thigh or other parts (was odd shaped and some was shredded). Rice quality was good but it was tortured dry in a microwave before it was served. Asked for check. Paid and then told the attendant that i was sorry but meal was not that good. His reply \""\""Okay...thanks....\""\""   For what i got and what i paid ($13) it was not only a rip off but an insult. Not once did ANYONE come over to ask if everything was ok. Rocky tables were stabilized with folded paper napkins, napkin holders on all tables are MIA. Napkins are just piled on a table with salt shakers to hold them down. How much are plastic glass and napkin holders at Ikea or Restaurant Depot? ts obvious these people don't give a crap about customers and dont have a clue about service. When they do close their doors, they will have no one to blame but themselves!"", ""What miserable customer service.   We went here as part of a special event for families of autistic children. While I commend the owners for reaching out to people with special needs, the way they handle themselves behind the counter is sickening.   When we got there we found out that the entire inside of the park was closed, something that was not mentioned anywhere in their press release (not on their own website either, despite their insistence that it was). So all the autistic kids were confined to a wave pool and two smaller areas, which was far from adequate for this particular crowd.  When I complained to the manager Dan, he was clearly overwhelmed by the situation and had no answers to give regarding why it was never stated that most of the facility was off limits. But at least he was polite, unlike Brandon.   Brandon, another assistant manager, interjected himself unasked in our conversation and interrupted me at every sentence. I guess if the customer can't finish a sentence it doesn't count as a complaint. Even when I asked him to let me speak he kept talking over me. Great managerial technique there.   He offered to refund our tickets but only if we left right then. While we had no problem leaving, there were a lot of families whose children took a lot effort to move either because of physical or developmental disabilities. Had either of them offered refunds at our leisure as a sign of good faith, we would have stayed and spent more than the cost of the tickets on the insanely over priced food ($12 for a basket of chicken fingers is utterly ridiculous), plus guaranteed our return another time. As it is they've lost our business permanently.   If you choose to go here, I hope you have fun. Just don't go expecting resolutions to any problems you might have, because apparently they don't know the first thing about customer service."", ""We had already spend a long while walking around through the parade and wanted to kill time before we got oysters. We were waiting for the line to die down at two other places but came across Creole House on the way to French quarter. The line was short and it was only a 20 minute wait. I am an oyster fiend. Living in NYC I got oysters every other night enjoying 2-3 dozens by myself. Thinking the oysters would be delicious , I ordered 2 dozens and so did my sister. We also shared a cup of gumbo. My sisters friend had a shrimp po boy with fries. After half a dozen oysters I started to feel nauseous. I didn't want to waste any oysters so I suffered though the first dozen. My sister has a strong stomach and finish 1.5 dozen. I couldn't eat anymore. The gumbo was terrible. It had no flavor, it was so tiny for 7 dollars(we had way better gumbo at another place the day after for way less). We had a taste of the po boy as well. It was just ok. My sisters friend didn't finish it either. The fries came fresh out the freezer I'm sure. Dry and scrawny little things. Should've just gone to French quarter and ate at one of the other places. Probably would've been better since the lines were longer. Would've been worth the wait. What a waste of money. And stomach space."", ""I haven't been here for at least three years and it's due to the service. Everytime I went to this store, just to look mostly, the staff were stuck up and one girl was even telling me how to hold a book so I don't break the binding. She even told me I have to pay for it if I hold it wrong. It was so odd that I just left and never went back. When I was in highschool, in the late 90's, this store was great but being grown up now I expect better service. Maybe they've changed but after over 10 visits of the same crummy service I'm not sure I want to find out."", ""This place is a joke. Never going there again. No concept of customer service at all.

Each time they suggest an alignment, which I had done in July! It's been the same two tires I keep telling them that are low on air and to look to see if they have leaks. 4 times all they did is reset the TPMS system. I acquired a copy of the hand written notes! They did NOT fix the issues with the tires. In mid September, I was on my way to work when one of the two tires had a blow out. Brought it back to have them  fix the tire issues. I had to watch them the entire time to make sure they did the work. Before I was ready to leave they said I needed an alignment! Must be a money maker for them! I told them I had one in July. They did it complimentary and when I got the results, there was NOTHING wrong with the alignment! I waged a complaint to their corporate office. I was told the district manager will be calling me, that hasn't happened yet!!!  Back again for the left front tire today! Guess what? They say I need an alignment! NOT!

It was by far the worst meal I have ever had. I ordered the chicken parmesan. This is a pretty hard dish to screw up but they did a fine job of it. It was an unidentifiable piece of gray rubbery meat (I think). The breading was soggy and I needed a steak knife to cut the chicken. I literally could not chew it, it was so tough. The garlic bread it came with, was also disgusting! It was greasy and hard. Yuck! My husband had a sauted chicken campagniola with veggies which was marginally better. The chicken was so overdone, it made it hard to stomach. The food was so disgustingly greasy that the brown bag they gave us broke. Uggh!  If you get food from this place, be warned. Maybe stick with the pizza."", ""Ribeye was amazing!!!   60 day dry aged. One of the best I've ever had!!! Shrimp cocktail was good, but I don't understand all the love? Service was great!

Had no problem getting in & now I know why. We had one of the worst meals & I spent almost $180.00. We sat outside, which was charming, except  we felt  lucky when the waiter showed up at our table. He was rushed & apologized for the lack of wine choices. The bread was wonderful... The Osso buco was hard, dry & so salty it was inedible. Sent that back, the waiter was nice about it, brought back the Scallop dish which was still oversalted &  really bad.  The side of grilled, Burnt, slimy asparagus was also salty & over cooked. And I truly wanted to send it back because it was horrible....did I mention cold? But we were starting to get in a hurry to leave so we could wash out the bad taste in our mouth.  My chicken dish was better than a microwave one from Big Lots, but the chicken was chewy, rubbery, 4 sure Not Organic, Farm Raised... Must be steroid chicken , no taste, and I cannot remember the name of the dish, I believe it had a few morsels of pasta with it.  Ughh...  The 1 star is for our waiter , he was OK, but I am SO OVER egoist, affected, waiters telling me about their view on wine, when they obviously have NO clue. I mention a Gaja Barberesco & he suggests the Amarone. And he continued with a Soliloquy on all the names of Top Italian Wines he knew & 10 minutes go by &  Guess what, they did not offer 1 of the them on their wine list!  So he wastes time trying to show me He Knows wine's names, but Timpanodoes not carry them.  The Beat thing I orderes was the cocktail I had in the beginning with Elderflower liquor, a splash of soda muddled mint &  cucumber. That was so refreshing.  My associate polished most of the Wine choice off her self. Which was good and was priced ok, I think the bottle was around $40.00.  Their wine list is minimal.  We expected an Italian Restaurant but it was more a New York Steak House.The food was ordinary, over salty, waaay over priced. And don't get me started on the Duo they booked 4 entertainment... Bottom line, That area of Hyde Parkis in construction & renovation so STAY AWAY. Wait 4 Goody Goody 2 open!

Kanella simply offers classic, rustic dishes made with fresh, often organic ingredients by a chef who obviously cares a lot about his food. You'll see him buzzing around the dining room, advising diners on how best to enjoy the dishes before them. Might come off as heavy-handed, but this guy knows exactly what he's doing.   Biggest hits for me include the whole fish (or any filet on the menu), duck breast and pork loin. For dessert, it's always the galaktobureko. Heaven.   Brunch is fantastic, too, and an even more affordable way to enjoy Kanella. Plus, the service is always spot-on, no matter how full the restaurant is."", ""Do not go here ever again. I've been ordering here for seven years and tonight I ordered the usual for the family and it was horrible.  They couldn't even get the burger right.

But they still screwed it up!  The doanir's came with lettuce and a dusting of donair meat. We asked for extra sweet sauce and we still had to look for any sauce at all!

Dr. Lore is amazing!"", ""The only thing that was even slightly ok about this experience was the waitstaff.  My roommate and I stopped in because we were looking for a place to have a late brunch.  They serve beer and since we were too late for mimosas anywhere this would have to do.  I ordered the chicken and waffles with sausage gravy and he got the breakfast burrito.  His was alright, nothing exceptional but it was edible.  Mine was absolutely horrendous.  I don't know if the gravy was spoiled or what the problem was.  Immediately when the plate was place in front of me I almost gagged from the smell.  It almost smelt like old garbage.  It is impossible to describe but on a hangover stomach it took all I had not to go running for the restroom.  Now, I didn't want to be rude so I decided to give it a go, maybe it was something else causing the smell.  It most definitely wasn't.  It tasted rancid and completely inedible.  My roommate, who is a human garbage disposal took a bite and immediately spit it out.  He couldn't even stomach it.  After 30 minutes of sitting in an empty diner with a plate of food that was hardly touched NO ONE came over to ask if there was any kind of problem.  Someone slapped a bill down in front of us when it looked like my roommate was finished eating and that was that.  My roommate had to push the plate across the counter because the smell was so terrible as he was trying to eat his own meal.  I am not a picky eater and there is no way that was how it was supposed to taste.  Later at home I ended up vomiting for the rest of the day.  I will not be back."", ""Though top notch service is demanded at a JW, I was thoroughly impressed with the property, service, and staff.   I only had two complaints. One was the noise level as there was an outdoor concert until 11pm. The other was the below average bartender at velocity during lunch. Nothing terrible, but lacked enthusiasm and desire to give good service. Obviously the concert wasn't the hotel's fault. The bartender issue wasn't worth dropping the rating a star.

They are very packed, hardly any parking and you always have to make a reservation. I thought I would be happy with the food. However, when we went for dinner the menu had some food that sounded good, but my husband and I struggled to find something that we liked.

My mother used to bring me there when I was growing up. My relatives shopped there too ; it was THE place that all of the old well to do familys of New Orleans went.       As a child , I never noticed the rudeness , I guess because it was my mom who had to work with the attendants while I sat board.   At twenty three , I had not yet purchased my own suits , and was still wearing the ones my mother had bought for me in my early years.    As a Twenty two year old I was a little intimidated as I walked in and saw the well dressed , sofisticated attendants . I remember receiving glares and a very rude , sarcastic  \""\"" may I help you  \""\"" from what appeared to be the man in charge at the time.   The rest of the visit didn't get any better. The attendant had a rude arrogance about him , as though he was doing me a favor even speaking to me .  He obviously did not remember me from the last ten years of business that my mother had given them , or maybe he did and just didn't care .  I suppose that having established themselves as THE place to buy clothing , they had developed an attitude of superiority , but to what , or who ? These guys sell clothes for gods sake , who are they superior to ?      This attitude has NOT changed.     A month ago , I decided to see if a quarter century had brought about anything positive in the way of attitude.  My treatment was no different from that of my visit in 1982.  One of my attendants ( the head guy that day)  , had the same arrogance as I remembered from years past.  His desire was to put me in what HE thought was best and displayed a sneer at my taste , ( wich is quite conservative in nature and right up their alley ).     I ended up getting three pairs of pants , one of which needed to be left for tailoring. I was told that I would be called when they were ready.     Four weeks had gone by with no call , so I called them.  The mans tone on the end of the line was one of a person insulted . It seems that I was the one in error for having waited that long before calling , and my tardiness was the insult.  How dare I suggest that Perlis would not have the work done in a week!!!    \""\"" We always do \""\"" , he said.  \""\"" May I ask who your attendant was  \""\"" ?   \""\""  I don't remember \""\"" I replied .            Then  , with a VERY sarcastic  \""\"" we'll do you remember the color  , sir \""\"" ?  , with the sarcastic emphasis on sir.    \""\"" I really don't , it was a moth ago  , and I bought them purely on a whim \""\"" , I replied .     \""\"" Well wait just a minute SIR and I'll go look\""\"" .      It was then that , wether by mistake or on purpose ,  I heard him say as the phone left his ear for the counter  , \""\"" STUPID IDIOT \""\"" !!                It was 30 minutes later that went through the door of Perlis for the last time.   There to greet me with same snied. , \""\"" may I help you sir \""\"" ,  was the man I had spoken with on the phone. In my minds eye ,  I was expecting to see someone like those who I had seen the month before , someone about 45 , dressed to the old New Orleans nines , but to my surprise it was a much older fellow , short in stature , and wearing a suit that I can only describe as strangely old fashioned , like something the duke of Windsor might have worn in 1968.  It's funny , I remember a picture from my childhood of a chimpanzee in a plaid suit very similar to the one he was wearing.  The picture was a spoof of a used car salesman if I recall.

I'm not sure if they changed ownership or if the guy that owns it has just gotten tired of having the business but it is definitely not a place to have a good time which is what people intend on doing when they smoke a hookah.  I read reviews on here before going and thought I would never visit this place until a friend of mine invited me.  I was hesitant but he talked me into coming by.  The reviews that speak of racism are correct. If your not white or Indian then definitely don't go here.  (however I am a white woman and still was treated bad, perhaps becasue I came with a lady and not a man? who knows.)

They stood over us and every 30 seconds were aggressively telling us that we had to decide on something or get out. We didn't order quick enough so they escorted us while yelling at us in their language and making rude gestures the entire way out. The owner continued to curse us as we crossed the street to leave in our car. Someone unknowingly, might think this was just a bad day. After reading others awful reviews it seems this is the norm.   Unfortunate and disappointed"", ""Ah... Three Muses.  What are the three muses you may ask? Well... if we weren't so lazy, I guess we could peruse the website to see what they were, but that actually seems like a lot of work. So, I'm just going to say that for me, the three muses represent good food, good music and good cocktails.   Simple enough, right?  But really, how many places do you go to where you LOVE the food, but the cocktails are so-so? Or the have delicious cocktails, but the food is lacking in flavor or originality?  Well, this place gets it right!  Three owners, from three different backgrounds, work together to bring us one place where we can get it all.  I want to say that I've had different drinks here, but that would probably be a lie. The only drink I have here is the Blueberry Bellini... It is spectacular. If you like champagne and blueberries, then this is the drink for you. If not, I feel sorry for you. No one should go through life without a wonderous love of champagne.  Every now and again the chef will be inspired to add something new to the food menu, but the staples remain the same. My favorites are the  Lamb Sliders, the Lobster Eggrolls, the Feta Fries and the delicious Pork Belly. I've never had a bad dish here, but that Pork Belly is simply divine!  The music is one reason that I frequent this place so often. The shows are free, but they ask a 1 drink minimum per set. . I never have a problem with a 1 drink minumum. (Blueberry Bellini, of course).   The music various from traditional jazz to blues to local singer/songwriter reviews. They do a really good job of booking talent and being that the venue is so intimate, you actually have a chance to talk to the musicians before, after and even inbetweent sets. (Don't forget to tip. And if you can, buy them a drink.)  The only problem I have with Three Muses is tt's a pretty small place. and  it can get pretty packed... especially for the 7pm music sets; leaving you without a table or a bar seat. So, I suggest getting there between 6 & 6:30 for a pretty much guaranteed seat.  The crowd varies. But it's always cool people, who enjoy good food, good music and good cocktails, so you will be in pleasant company.  Have a great time!"", ""Perfectly seasoned meatloaf.

As a more recent addition to the Bailey's group of restaurants, L'Acadiane is on par with the quality they are well known for.  If you're a fan of New Orleans style or southern food in general, you will love the St. Louis twist they put on the food here. There is just enough kick to it without being overpowering. We tried a bit of everything. The poblano grits were a favorite as well as the roffignac cocktail made with sparkling ros\u00e9- a perfect blend between the raspberry and lemon.   Randall, our server was super patient. He realized we were there to take our time, and we did not feel rushed. He did his best to answer questions and cater to allergies.

Eggs looked and tasted like they had been held for a while after being cooked, not at all fresh. Salad on one plate had more dressing then salad, really inedible. What I did notice was the complete lack of bacon or sausage or anything pork related. Odd for a brunch, but maybe gypsies don't eat meat? The other thing I found was 1. It was 40 degrees in the bathroom, really really cold. 2. The wall next to our table really needed painting, or at least washing, food splatters and grease stains on the paint were really unappealing. The cute puffy wall coverings looked like someone used them as napkins over and over.  A tremendous disappointment after many really great experiences at Southern Cross.  It seems to me they can do a lot better, or close the place for a rehab.  We felt pretty ripped off with brunch, though the live music was awesome. Maybe dinner is better, breakfast is really hard to do well after all but I doubt we will ever find out as we have no intention of returning.

Go lower.  - Sectionals by themselves average around $1,000 by brands I've never heard of.  - The staff hangs out like a clique chatting in the middle of the store rather than helping customers.  -Dining sets are nothing special and overpriced as well.

I have seen many films at the International House. I can feel they really love film and respect the many mediums of film. Films are usually shown in the original medium in which they were recorded. This makes for a much different experience than watching the films at home.   The theater is clean and the seating is stadium seating. They hold film festivals and show many rare and foreign films. I've been here multiple times where they have difficulty starting a film. I'm not sure if that is because of the medium or because they aren't prepared.

The hipster donut offerings here are a wretched disappointment. Sorry Strange, your toppings are decent, but the donuts themselves are weirdly dry and thick. Sorry Vincent Van Doughnut...actually, I'm not sorry - you should be sorry for selling me that chocolate-coffee abomination. That's the first donut I ever left unfinished. It's literally sprinkled with coffee grounds. It would take some insanely good chocolate to carry that, but instead you thinly coated the donut with some mediocre dark chocolate.  Thankfully, the anomaly works both ways. This homestyle shop has some truly excellent stuff, for insanely low prices. Chocolate icing has much more depth of flavor than your average cheap-donut-chocolate. Blueberry cakes are light, fresh, and fruity - perfectly sweet. Buttermilks are rich and satisfying.

One visit is never enough.  I can't begin to count the number of patrons I hear say they have just landed at the airport and headed straight over, or they have been in town a few days and already visited multiple times, or are headed home and just had to stop in one more time before the flight home.  The one thing I love most about this restaurant even more than the food is the fact that I can sit at the bar on any given day and I'm just as likely to sit next to a regular as I am to sit next to someone from half way around the world. People literally flock to this hole in the wall neighborhood seafood restaurant.  It's a relatively small restaurant so if you need a table your more than likely going to have to wait. Sometimes when it's real busy there is even a wait for the bar. All seating is first come first served & they do not take reservations. You can also order food to go if you don't have the inclination or the time to sit in the restaurant and eat, but I'll admit this is the type of food that is at its best when you sit in and eat.  Speaking of the food.... All of the fresh fish served in the restaurant is taken from the fresh market which is next door to the restaurant. It's all in the same building just two separate entrances.  There is always a fresh fish of the day on special along with various other specials to tempt your taste buds.   Harbor serves boiled shrimp all year and boiled crawfish and boiled crab when in season, fried or grilled baskets, various seafood po-boys, and seafood salads.  Some of my favorite items to order are: Appetizers... fried calamari, fried pickles, 1/2 blackened gator 1/2 fried gator, cheese sticks, fried crab claws, and fried crawfish tails. Some of my favorite main dishes to order are... Boiled shrimp, fresh fish of the day, stuffed lobster, any of the baskets including stuffed shrimp, catfish, oyster, the combo basket which includes shrimp, catfish, oyster and stuffed crab, also the swamp platter which is a special combo that includes fried crawfish, frog legs, gator, cajun gator sausage, turtle soup, and  crawfish etouffee, and don't laugh at me but I also like to order the kids burger. Harbor also serves raw oysters on the half shell! You can order by the half dozen or dozen, or multiple dozens. There is always an oyster shucker on hand, and they always shuck in full view of the restaurant.  I have to say this: if you order raw oysters, don't forget to tip the shuckers because they are working just has hard as your waiter or waitress. Harbor seafood is my go to restaurant for seafood,  a burger, a drink at the bar after work or any other time of day. I enjoy the variety of people who work here and also enjoy the variety of patrons I come across on any given day, and I'd be lying if I didn't say I enjoy seeing my artwork on the wall in the restaurant.

The dressing was creamy without being cloying and it had a nice garlic zip to it.   This is the place to eat!"", ""Foreword: My experience with the Bottleworks is as an event venue.  Every year, when the WUSTL department I'm in is trying to recruit new graduate students, we hold a social event here for the prospective and current students to mingle and get to know each other better.  The two years I've taken part in this event have just been a blast.  The Schlafly event room in the back-- I forget the name of it, but I think it has one-- is just a fun and unique place to have a private event.  The view of the Bottleworks is impressive, and the huge private bar set up on the side is just great.  I think the cost is pretty reasonable for us, too, which includes unlimited beer/wine per head along with a bunch of delicious hors d'oeuvre.  I'm a member of the group that helps put the event on this year, and I definitely think we're sticking with the Bottleworks again.  Look forward to an updated review around February or March next year!"", ""Awesome service and food.

Definitely try the Horta Greens (you can substitute fries for Horta Greens or have them on the side). The perfectly cooked and seasoned greens are delicious.

I had a Mercedes Benz that I'd owned for years and only drove in the Summer months. It always started right up after being in storage for the Winter one year it was somewhat hard starting. I took it to the M-B dealer who kept it for three days and had the mechanic come and talk to me when I picked it up. The mechanic tried to convince me that there was nothing wrong and that was the way it should be, I asked around and learned about Bob. I brought the car to him, he fixed the problem and informed me that the car had three cold start systems and two weren't working right. Minor repairs set them right and the car stared as it always had. Bob charged me little or nothing for the work and I then became a loyal client. I eventually sold the car and was upset that Bob didn't work on any other marques. I understand that he may, now.   I'd buy a used M-B if for no other reason than I'd know I'd have a great mechanic who could work on it. He is extremely knowledgeable, highly competent, and his prices are very reasonable."", ""I have to say I thought that this was going to be an awesome body shop, based off of their reviews. I was very wrong, and now I am extremely disappointed. I figured I'd at least leave a review, so others would not share my experience.  I went here after I was involved with an accident; my insurance company USAA referred me to this shop. Upon arriving the place is clean and look like a secure lot to leave your car in night after night while getting it repaired, the front-end staff was friendly (Jackie is a sweetie) and the gentleman Kenny that quoted me seemed nice until I started asking question.  I explain to the Kenny what happen during the accident; once I was done he started writing his initial estimate. The original estimate that  was made, is made before my car is even worked on and is just preliminary; this is not a true or accurate estimate since the car has not been worked on or disassembled to see further damages. However Kenny definitely did a less then par-look of my vehicle that he told be needed about $500.00 in repairs. What a Joke.   This was odd to me because I had taken it to a non-USAA body shop before taking it here, so that I could have an unbiased estimate. When I started asking Kenny question he quickly got defensive about the quote stating that this is all USAA would cover.   This confused me an truly contradicted the 1st body shop I choose to stop at (Which was Infinite of Tampa) Still I think its funny that I got quoted at a few other very well know and highly rated body shops in the area later that day that were also not on the USAA list and they quoted me a proper and accurate quotes so that my car was not two toned and it was a complete repair from the loss.    Kenny said statements like: **(\""\""Each of these additional areas contain pre existing damage not related to this loss (stone chips and sub standard prior bumper repair.\""\"")** Kenny was happy to quote me but not happy to submit a supplement estimate that would cause about $2000 more worth of charges. He said things like \""\""USAA will not over it.\""\""  So verse Kenny backing up his new customer, to help the insurance company see why the repair needed to be done this way, he decided to tell me I will need to do the run around to get it cover. What a bunch of cowards... You would think that they would want all the business they can get, like most small businesses. However I understand why they wouldn't do the repairs, it affects their relationship with USAA, because they would have had to express to USAA that the cheap amount of $500 that they already distributed to me was not going to cover the true repair.  Advice For Kenny:  Most cars in all of America have normal wear and tear damages that are common and irrelevant, to the accident. Which in this case damage the right of my bumper and right fender and right H.I.D.  I think every driver in America can agree that they have some random scratches and stone chips on the their vehicle, this shouldn't stop your insurance company from doing a complete repair. People like Kenny should genuinely be ashamed when saying things like this to insurance consumers trying to hoodwink them out of a complete repair.    However I guess when your business is fed LEADS from USAA it is necessary to keep USAA happy, by doing the cheapest possible repair to your car. I don't think as a consumer it is at all wrong to tell your insurance companies that the cheap quote from they're less then par-auto body shop won't do. The Fact is a USAA adjuster never said that the repair couldn't be covered you Kenny just thought it couldn't be covered, and misleading customers in no joke.  I want everyone to know that if you choose this body shop base on a USAA recommendation, prepare not to be heard and your concerns invalided, with trivial insurance BS, as you will only get the repair that they think they will get approved with the insurance companies, and not the repair your car deserves.    Side Note:  USAA cover all the cost that this auto body shop said they wouldn't. Thanks USAA, as I know consumer who pays the monthly bill to be insured properly is your number one concern. Big thank you to Infiniti of Tampa for sticking by me to make sure all the repairs got covered."", ""Absolutely love coming to this place to grab some beers or wine with friends.

The nachos were a joke, the salsa is not fresh, all food seems to be frozen and reheated. They display specials on a blackboard as you enter but fail to mention they are only valid at the bar. Found this out once we received the bill. My wife ordered the Greek chicken pita which comes with fries and she asked to have old bay fries instead of standard fries. We get the bill and they charged us for a basket of old bay fries and when questioned why the charge for a basket, they said the Greek Pita came with chips but we didn't even get the chips.  The waitress then says \""\""oh I thought you wanted to sub fries for the chips\""\"" then why did we get charged the full amount for the basket of fries, there should have been some discount if it was a sub. The waitress completely forgot my drink refill and brought it out with the check about 10-15 minutes after she took my glass.

The first time I showed up I was told they were closed for a Spring Spruce up and would be open on the 11th. I left a little annoyed because there was no indication of this on their website, which I had used to look them up and browse the menu. I later discovered they had something up on their Facebook page about being closed, but seeing as those I don't have a Facebook, this was of no benefit to me. Today (March 15th) I drove all the way over only to discover a sign on the door stating they will be closed the remainder of the week! This time I checked their Facebook and there was no information regarding the extended closure. In fact it was a bit confusing because they had posts advertising the re-opening and even pictures posted of people eating there for a brunch event just the other day. Is this some kind of secret society of delicious eatery? I really wish I knew. Poor communication on the businesses side of things has made me feel like I probably won't be giving these guys a try. If I do muster up the fortitude to drive clear across town again I will definitely be calling ahead to make sure they are open.

So, when we had guests in town, we decided to drive a bit and take them to Bottleworks on a nice fall day to enjoy a few drinks before dinner at our place. What in the heck happened to this place? Saturday afternoon, the patio was about 2/3 full, but we got a 30-45 minute wait for 15 people including a few babes. On top of that, we were told we had to order food if we sat on the patio. Fine, we will order a few appetizers. Nope, it had to be entrees. After promising to make it up to the server and tip well, we were given a pager. Waited 45 minutes to be seated as we watched tables sit empty. Once seated, some of our group ordered entrees because the server made them feel bad, so that made the meal I already had prepared completely worthless. The topper was when we got our checks, the server told us we were not as bad as she expected and to come back again when we got babysitters for the babies. So is there some new trend in hospitality to treat your guests like this that should make them want more?  I do hold a special place in my heart for this place as we used to walk there with our kids all the time and even hit up their markets and other events, but I was so embarrassed for talking this place up the way I did and actually driving more than a mile to go here. Surely, Schlafly realizes that there is another great brewery right down the street that has a much better vibe and appreciation for their guests.

I agree with others that the ambience and decor could use updating, but I think it's very clean and the service has always been friendly.

The aisle was so narrow to begin with and with everyone in line having a cart it was impossible to look at what I wanted.  Even if I asked someone to move, so I could get closer, it would have been useless since there was no where for them to move there carts.

Boy if I could give this business less than one star I would ( I guess the single star can go to the overall look of the inside). Other than that let me tell you about my experience with this business. I booked my boyfriend and I for our first couples massage for his birthday today, Saturday, on Tuesday morning. The person I talked to on the phone seemed to be in a rush but seemed to have gotten all of my information even asking if I was okay with a male and female masseuse. When I went to spell out my name I got a quick \""\""okay okay\""\"" mid sentence. No big deal. Today when my boyfriend and I got there twenty minutes early for a massage we saw a busy fully booked very busy business. We sat there for probably 5 to 10 minutes before being acknowledged. Still not a big deal they were busy and that's why we got there early for things like this. After the guy got our name he looked at the appointments list repeatedly trying to find our names or numbers he simply said we weren't on the books. There was nothing he could do they were fully booked for the day and then he proceeded to ask me who I spoke to on the phone did she sound Vietnamese because that was the owner she does that all the time to people. She takes there appointment and never writes it down! This was the most ridiculous thing that I have ever heard of. We asked when the owner would be in and he said she was there. Then we asked well won't she do something about this and he just flat out said no. The second most ridiculous thing that I have ever heard. We left at that point. Needless to say I was pissed at this point no massage for us. Birthday ruined. Can't comment on actual paid for services can only speak of owner and employees."", ""Went for a round of golf Oct 14. First off, they were re-seeding, so it's understandable that the course was under 'duress'. The price was $29, you could not drive a cart off the path, the fairways looked great, obviously soaked in water for the over seeding, and the greens were effectively sand mats. To start they placed a single behind our party of 4 so we immediately had to let the individual behind us play through. All of this was fine until the sprinklers began pumping water into our round. Again, I know that they were over seeding, but we and many others were on the course when sprinklers kicked into full swing behind, ahead, and on top of us. Literally, we were surprise sprayed by popping sprinklers. Let's be clear here, I am not a professional greens keeper, and I do not claim to be an expert in watering of grass in a desert environment, but when people are playing through the course I feel it's fair that the sprinklers are monitored to allow their patrons to enjoy the experience. To finish this off, I am writing this review not because of the conditions, but because of the unacceptable courtesy of the two individuals in the proshop. After being unceremoniously assaulted by the surprise sprinkler attack, I went into the proshop commenting \""\""Hey, we were playing on the course and the sprinklers, not only prevented us from playing the round, they sprayed us\""\"" (with what I assume to be reclaimed water, no fun). The more senior individual looked at me with an attitude and simply said \""\""Well that's over seeding, their going all day, we tried to warn you\""\"" (while holding up the, carts on path only - reseeding sign). The whole experience was low, but these guys topped it off. I have zero interest in going back to this middle of nowhere course."", ""Ordered from grubhub waited an hour and a half for delivery so I called naturally no one picked up for another 20 minutes then when the guy answers his explanation was that they were on break and hadn't made my order yet and gave me the \""\"" oh well\""\"" attitude and didn't offer any kind of compensation."", ""Great place for big groups.

When a friend and I decided to head out for dinner during Devour Indy, I was so glad to see them on the list!

The salmon was perfectly cooked, juicy and flaky. The polenta was amazing. I left wishing I had ordered another to have the next day! It was nice having the signature drinks included with dinner. He chose the sangria and I chose the margarita. Both were very good. I'll definitely be back to Delicia for dinner again.

I went to Las Cazuelas for the first time for my birthday.  We had a wonderful time.  I was looking for a fun and festive place to go with friends.  This was the perfect choice.

Plus, the food here is delicious.   I'm surprised this place doesn't have higher reviews on Yelp, because it far exceeded my expectations...   The guacamole appetizer was fresh and yummy.  I ordered the shrimp entree with rice and vegetables, and asked for it spicy.  My entr\u00e9e had an attractive presentation on the plate (i.e. looked classy), and was delicious, well seasoned, and very fresh. On my suggestion, my partner ordered one of their mole sauce dishes (i.e. a sauce usually made from unsweetened chocolate and pureed pumpkin seeds), and it was tasty too.   I should also note that the waitress was very attentive.  When I placed my order, I explained to her that I have mild lactose intolerance and can't eat much butter or cream (but am okay with cheese), so she had the chef cook the veggies in olive oil, rather than butter.  Thanks for being so cool about accommodating that request!    The prices are extremely reasonable for fancy and unusual Mexican food, and I love the fact they're a BYOB.  The chef serves creative and inspired cuisine, which has a traditional flair and style to it.  In other words: Don't come here for regular tacos or burritos.  Come here for a fun foodie experience at a reasonable price, and bring tequila for the perk of BYOB Margaritas!"", ""Wanted to follow up the review I wrote in Sept. Everything has been great.

Good food can last for a day or two.When i went in there to eat the hostess was nice. first, we ordered a glass a wine. he poured the wine, missed the glass and some spilled on the table and he just ignored it. hello. idiot. waitressing 101. go back. well needless to say. not worth your money at all. ive been there during happy hour with girlfriends and its fine. not a 'high end' restaurant by any means even though they try to make it that way."", ""2 hours I'll never get back. Waited for the food for an hour before the bartender came back and asked if I ordered something I had not. Clearly had not even put my order in. Another hour wait to close my tab. My drink was refilled once in this 2 hour time period. The food was actually good, but wasting 2 hours of my day in an atmosphere (terribly loud at 11am) I couldn't wait to leave was far from pleasant."", ""After a long drive home we were looking for a nice quiet dinner so decided to try this place. I called to reserve a tbl and was told not to worry about it because after 8:30 all guests would have been seated. To be sure, I asked the young lady if she'd like my name to hold a table but was assured we were fine and to just come in. Kitchen is open to 10pm. My date and I arrived at 9:42 and asked to be seated. There were three tables at the time and we were starving. The server reluctantly said hello, I asked for a table and she made a face followed by the infamous \""\""let me check with chef on that\""\"". Needless to say, chef said no and we were turned away! I've been in the hospitality business for the better part of 20 years and this is my #1 pet peeve. It's a luxury to have guests coming in the door and the last thing you do is turn them away, especially like this. The girl even had the nerve to tell me I didn't have a reservation! I'll stop my rant here. Needless to say, I'll never go back and I'll make sure I tell all my coworkers/friends to stay away.  It's a shame because I'm sure the place is great (3 bells) but they have a loser chef with a poor attitude and that's just bush league. Nice work cheffrey."", ""Terribly slow service, as in over 30 minutes in a short line. Very rude employees and quite dirty. Very disappointed in the quality all around. Will not be returning to this place again."", ""Went for a round of golf Oct 14. First off, they were re-seeding, so it's understandable that the course was under 'duress'. The price was $29, you could not drive a cart off the path, the fairways looked great, obviously soaked in water for the over seeding, and the greens were effectively sand mats. To start they placed a single behind our party of 4 so we immediately had to let the individual behind us play through. All of this was fine until the sprinklers began pumping water into our round. Again, I know that they were over seeding, but we and many others were on the course when sprinklers kicked into full swing behind, ahead, and on top of us. Literally, we were surprise sprayed by popping sprinklers. Let's be clear here, I am not a professional greens keeper, and I do not claim to be an expert in watering of grass in a desert environment, but when people are playing through the course I feel it's fair that the sprinklers are monitored to allow their patrons to enjoy the experience. To finish this off, I am writing this review not because of the conditions, but because of the unacceptable courtesy of the two individuals in the proshop. After being unceremoniously assaulted by the surprise sprinkler attack, I went into the proshop commenting \""\""Hey, we were playing on the course and the sprinklers, not only prevented us from playing the round, they sprayed us\""\"" (with what I assume to be reclaimed water, no fun). The more senior individual looked at me with an attitude and simply said \""\""Well that's over seeding, their going all day, we tried to warn you\""\"" (while holding up the, carts on path only - reseeding sign). The whole experience was low, but these guys topped it off. I have zero interest in going back to this middle of nowhere course."", ""Ordered curbside pickup service and it's a total fail. I arrived and called the number NO answer. Called again a couple minutes later they answered. Waited as instructed and waited. When found out the pizza was never cooked.

I get a call from them minutes after I placed my order saying they are out of 3 of the toppings that I wanted on my pizza.  When I got the pizza delivered, it was not even edible because there was way too much cheese and the dough was SO thin towards the middle it would just fall apart where we couldn't even pick the pizza up.  It was a sloppy mess and we couldn't even eat it.  Very disappointing."", ""First off the bathroom smell like dirty seafood which almost took away my appetite to start with we order the king crab and lobster tacos there was hardly any meat in the king crab and considering that it was more expensive than the 3 pounds of a different kind of crab you would think that there would've been plenty of meat My lobster tacos was over an under cooked but the next two days hunched over the toilet so disappointed"", ""Worst sushi place ever!

I called a few places to try to get a massage in today because I knew indeed it badly. No one had any availability and I stumbled across massage envy on Google and thought to give them a try. Not only were they able to fit me in with the exact specific type I needed, but they also were able to fit my father in at the exact same time. Jen was understanding and nice, she asked me questions and checked up on me constantly. She even showed me some at home techniques I could use. She took her time, obviously did not rush. Carrie, I believe, was the name of the woman who did a foot massage on my father. He was very pleased and recommended I try it sometime. They also informed me about the membership program which not only is very cost-efficient, but also adheres to my busy schedule. I signed up on the spot with no hesitation. Friendly staff, great atmosphere, comfortable building and very calming environment! Would recommended!

We just moved to Dunedin and have been to many spots on Main Street ( Living Room, Casa Tina , Black Pearl, Pisces, Bon Appetite, Sea Sea Riders ) and had great food and fun . We got there around noon and it was busy . The hostess was sort of confusing but we told her table for two inside . She gave us a pager and showed us to the bar . The bar seats were full so we sort of stood by the door . We were there around 10 minutes when another couple came in and checked in at the hostess stand and came into the bar to wait . About 20 minutes later I checked in at hostess stand and was surprised they were working off two waiting lists - I thought that was odd . The hostess told me not too much longer . The next couple sat was the couple who came in 10 minutes after us . We were called by the host who proceeded to seat us outside . I told him we had asked for inside he was very nice and apologized saying he thought we were first available but now saw we had asked for inside . As we walked back to the bar we saw the 10 minute arriving after us couple at their inside table and decided to leave . We told the hostess ,who really only cared what number our pager was , that we were upset and she seemed not to really care at all . After repeating that I was upset about the couple being sat before us she mumbled something about coming back and trying them again ! What ?!! Too many places on Main Street for that kind of service . We go out a lot and we won't be going to Kelly's again . We stoped in on Thursday night to the outside bar and asked the new bartender ( she was sweet but not trained ) if it was happy hour she said she didn't know and had to go find out .

Food was ordered for a couple of girls in our office and when dealing with Ashley the young lady from our office got into a long drawn out convo with her and they had words.  I was not the one on the phone call, so I did not think I was going to be treated poorly, but I was.  I don\\'t understand why Ashley would not give us her first name unless she was concerned about something. By her doing so, it made myself and a co worker that came in with me feel as if something was probably done to our food.

I called the owner David to discuss all of this and he did not take the call or call me back"", ""I wish I could give this zero stars, this gave my husband and kid a really really bad stomach ache after eating here.

My family went because we were new to the area and have heard great things. They are very packed, hardly any parking and you always have to make a reservation. I thought I would be happy with the food. However, when we went for dinner the menu had some food that sounded good, but my husband and I struggled to find something that we liked. We did get the California roll and that was good, but we were not impressed with the teriyaki chicken. It seems like our experience is one of the few, but personally we will not be going back again."", ""The reviews weren't all that positive, but I wanted to give the restaurant a try anyhow because you can sometimes find a diamond in a dive.

Not sure what the fish had to do with the overall theme since the ceiling is blue with sparkle like glittery cast over it.   The food was nothing to write home about and nor were the desserts semi frozen spinning in the glass display case.

My husband and I decided to try take out this evening from this place. When we got home we opened our daughters spaghetti and meatballs and there was hardly any pasta/sauce and NO meatballs. Frustrating. Hubby had to drive back to the restaurant to get her meal corrected. I'll also add that I think $9 for a kids meals is a bit absurd for PASTA. My fettuccini Alfredo was bland. The portion was small but I never finish all the pasta most places give me so that wasn't a big deal. My husbands tortellini tasted like it was frozen, same with the calamari. Definitely doesn't taste like they use fresh ingredients. I will say they marinara is good but not enough for us to go back.

In the men's bathroom there's just a trash bag taped on the wall where a urinal used to be.  I have also overheard that 3 female employees have quit. Which makes it seem like it's not a safe place for ladies.  The bartender I encountered seemed very overwhelmed and perturbed with serving customers that weren't  friends and that weren't doing shots of cheap liquor.

92,"[""Wow!  I just wrote a scathing review about El Patron Pizza in Tampa for leaving unwanted and unwelcome fliers under the door of unsuspecting tourist here in Tampa.  I was going to use a lot of the same issues for this review of New York Pizza Grill, but now I'm not sure what to say, only to say it carefully.  I knew there was something not quite right about the greasy looking punk that was meandering in the hallway of the 4 star hotel where I am currently residing.  As soon as I saw the flier I grabbed my room key and went looking for this person.  In hindsight that was not smart, as soon as I got a look at the guy, I ran for the elevator.  Now, I am no shrinking violet, but this guy looked like he's slap his own mother.  After reading the other reviews on here, I guess I should be happy that this employee didn't turn around and attack!  My biggest issue with this business is that they litter the halls and rooms with these fliers.  They sneak into hotels, a place where you feel safe and after this, I don't.  It doesn't seem to matter where it is a 5 star hotel chain or a family run business.  I did call every one of the pizza place that do this, because I felt bad about complaining to the staff at the hotel, but after yesterdays run in with greasy guy for New York Pizza Grill, I had it.  I do not feel safe and I told management that, and the did call the police.  So, for the employee of New York Pizza Grill, if you get caught stuffing fliers under doors where you are not invited and do not belong, you are more than likely going to be arrested.  So when you are out and about making not enough to keep your car running, ask yourself if your boss will bail you out of jail.  I doubt it, they'll probably just get another less than intelligent person to litter, trespass, annoy and sometimes terrify, hotel staff and their guests.  There are numerous reasons not to eat at New York Pizza Grill, but I'm just tossing out a good reason not to work for them."", ""I believe the owner greeted me at the door. She was rude and threatened service if I didn't get gel. The quality received is not worth the price."", ""I am here right now and I will tell you this. Either get here early, or don't bother trying at all. If there are no parking spots, that should be the first indication that inside is cramped AF and OVERFLOWING with people. If there is a line outside extending so far back that you could see it as you approach the entrance, I'm sorry but no. To validate what you will probably be thinking, no, it won't be worth it. There were no lockers upon entry which is understandable, but either make enough lockers so that it could accommodate the maximum capacity, or SET a maximum capacity, and when you REACH that capacity, inform visitors that tickets are sold out, or that they can hang at the arcade until people leave, at which point that line may enter. I honestly think that they just sell tickets until there are no more people to sell it to, and you'd agree if you were here right now. People are looking for seats. The pools are tremendously overcrowded. There are teenagers running around everywhere bumping up against people, and not enough lifeguards to maintain them. The toddlers area is way too small (and that's right, crowded), and there aren't enough accommodations for them when its jam-packed like this.   Maybe I'll come back during the colder season, but I'll definitely have to make sure I plan it so that we arrive when the doors open so that we get a spot for the car, a locker, and enough time for the baby to get some rides in.

We called and removed some luxery items which brought our bill to 225.00 a month. Called 4 time a to see how we could get our bill lowered, as we have been a loyal customer for 14 years. \""\""Nothing we can do\""\"" was all I heard. We decided to no longer be raped by this company and set up service with Verizon. Called Comcast to cancel once we got hooked up with Verizon. All of a sudden, they can do better and reduce my bill to 140.00 a month....which I would have been extremely happy with. Unfortunately, it should have been offered the four previous times I called.  I have Verizon now and have been quite happy with the installation, customer service, and overall product.  I wish Comcast would go under because they don't care about quality customer service. They could offer me a years free of service, yet I wouldn't take it on principle. Screw you Comcast!"", ""I went in on Friday and made a reservation for Sunday at 530 for a group of eight.  We had a show to attend at 7pm at the Fox.  Penca is a small restaurant and I knew we would not be able to walk in and get a table, hence the reservation. We showed up and we were told it would be a while, a group was seated at our table.  We waited, and waited.  I had some disagreeable word with the hostess.  We waited some more.  We got two stories - one was none at all just \""\""sorry\""\"", the other was the group came in claimed the table and told the staff they were friends of the owner and they'd cause trouble if removed from the table.  Doesn't matter to me because if the latter is true the owner needs new friends since the current ones will put them out of business, and if the former is just ineptness on the part of staff they'll be out of business.   And so we waited some more.  Given the timing leaving for anything but Subway was not an option. We got seated about 35 minutes late. They comp'd us two drinks for eight people for the wait. I will give a shout out to our server who did a great job of trying to put this train wreck back on the tracks. He did a very good job."", ""Terrible experience. Went in looking for some new frames. Found the frame shape I was interested in and started trying on a couple of frames.

I mentioned that my current pair were a little bent, but that they worked for me. I took off the glasses to show him and he took them and said that he was going to adjust them. I didn't ask for him to do that and I was VERY hesitant after he said that he would not be liable if they broke. I told him that I'd rather he not adjust them, because they were my only pair (and I didn't ask him to do it in the first place!). Then as he handed them back to me, he said rudely, \""\""Well, I'll just put 12 years of experience in my pocket!\""\"" I felt embarrassed, so I decided to leave.

Out of all the things I was told to do in NOLA, going on a haunted tour was the top of our list! We met the tour guide on the corner of a busy area outside a small grocery store. The only thing I might say that was confusing was the other groups that were doing a haunted tour the same time we were and were meeting in the same vicinity. We approached the other group by accident and said we were there for the 5 in 1 tour, the man who for the other tour company told us we were in the wrong place and made very negative comments about our tour guide and the company we had signed up for. Honestly it just made HIS company look bad that he would say that to someone.   Anywho, the tour was awesome-not going to give any of it away because the stories are best told by the Bone Lady herself. She was so animated and knowledgeable and while other reviewers have said negative comments about the tour, they probably just weren't paying attention (which is hard to do on a Friday night in the French quarter)   At the very end of the tour our group approached the bone lady to tell her how much we enjoyed the tour, she told us about her cemetery tour which was taking place on Sunday. We signed up with her right then and there! SERIOUSLY go on both of these tours, you won't regret it!   One more comment about the negative reviews, you'll notice a couple people say it's boring: it's not!

He promised that the Internet would be faster and better than the one we were using, saying that each device would be connected to 100mb, not every device sharing that 100mb, our cable would be the exact same and we'd have a land line on top of it all for the same price that we were paying with AT&T. Absolute crap! We had the most basic of basic channels and the Internet was MUCH slower than AT&T. We were less than 24 hours in with Charter and attempted to get things corrected. No one would work with us and offered to charge us more to have the same channels we had before.

I'm currently having the absolute worst food poisoning experience of my life.  According to my primary care physician, aka WebMD, it is likely that I have some form of aggressive salmonella food poisoning.  The other dishes looked good, and I'm sure the prawn mee is typically not vomit/diarrhea-inducing, but i hope this issue is addressed promptly."", ""I was so looking forward to a Pho joint in the neighborhood.  no anymore !

I'm a huge fan of savory cafe and I just tried coffee cat for the first time today. I've been to French press countless times with friends and today completely changed my opinion. I've been sitting here for twenty minutes lost in homework planning on being here for way too long to write several essays and order numerous drinks. However I didn't feel like getting one the second I sat down. One of the baristas just came up to me and basically accused me of not getting a drink. Our conversion, \""\""did we get you a drink\""\"" \""\""no I haven't ordered one yet\""\"" \""\""are you going to\""\"" \""\""yes, in do time\""\"" \""\""thanks\""\"" Do I have to order one the second I get here?!?! It's not like I look fucking homeless here with my Mac and nice clothes. Actually baffled hahaha I wish I wasn't so pleasant when she spoke with me. What's up with the fact that they don't have green tea matcha powder? Their coffee is good I'll give them that, but maybe they need to weave out some of the rude people who work here. Pitty. I'm a loyal customer."", ""Their pizza is pretty good, service is usually cool inside. But today I ordered a delivery for the first time, the driver was very insulting to me. When I open my door she asked me about a car across the street with a guy in the driver's seat. I replied \""\""I don't know,\""\"" she said \""\""cus I don't wanna be set up to get robbed\""\"". Mind you I already paid with my visa when I ordered, her behavior made me feel awkward as if I had done something wrong. I gave her the tip I had in my hand and said thank you, hoping that maybe if I remain polite she'll stop thinking so negative I just wanted some pizza not to be judged because of my surroundings or to be stereotyped."", ""First let me start off by saying DO NOT go to this business for your special occasion the owner does not care about you! Boy if I could give this business less than one star I would ( I guess the single star can go to the overall look of the inside). Other than that let me tell you about my experience with this business. I booked my boyfriend and I for our first couples massage for his birthday today, Saturday, on Tuesday morning. The person I talked to on the phone seemed to be in a rush but seemed to have gotten all of my information even asking if I was okay with a male and female masseuse. When I went to spell out my name I got a quick \""\""okay okay\""\"" mid sentence. No big deal. Today when my boyfriend and I got there twenty minutes early for a massage we saw a busy fully booked very busy business. We sat there for probably 5 to 10 minutes before being acknowledged. Still not a big deal they were busy and that's why we got there early for things like this. After the guy got our name he looked at the appointments list repeatedly trying to find our names or numbers he simply said we weren't on the books. There was nothing he could do they were fully booked for the day and then he proceeded to ask me who I spoke to on the phone did she sound Vietnamese because that was the owner she does that all the time to people. She takes there appointment and never writes it down! This was the most ridiculous thing that I have ever heard of. We asked when the owner would be in and he said she was there. Then we asked well won't she do something about this and he just flat out said no. The second most ridiculous thing that I have ever heard. We left at that point. Needless to say I was pissed at this point no massage for us. Birthday ruined. Can't comment on actual paid for services can only speak of owner and employees.""]",3

Almost feels like it belongs downtown it's so nice tucked in here. Food was delicia! We had the guacamole, queso, salsa trio and chips for an appetizer - all were very good. Trad margarita was really tasty. Entrees were the corn cakes (heavenly!) and the chicken mole (didn't like too much!) Dessert is yummy too."", ""Brought my friend here for her birthday because it is very hard to find a place that serves sushi on a boat! This place didn't have it but I know they decorated their plates nicely so that's not bad either!  Our waitress was very nice and wished her a happy birthday once she saw the Happy Birthday balloon. She even came out with fried cheese cake with a candle and started singing happy birthday at the end!  The birthday girl had the Bloomingdale Roll $13 which was spicy tuna, spicy salmon, spicy kani, spicy yellowtail and spicy shrimp avocado with longan on top. It was good but I'm not really a fan of the pink seaweed thing. I asked the waitress if they could write \""\""Happy Birthday\""\"" on her plate and they did. They even added a little tree and made it look like a little island!  My other friend ordered the Cancer Roll $15 which was spicy tuna, seaweed, salad, eel, masago, soft shell crab. They drew a bird on her plate! It was so cute!  I had the M16 Roll (sounds like a gun) $13 - eel tempura with spicy tuna rolled in black and red tobiko (fish eggs). It was yummy! And they decorated my plate too! I had a little tree as well.  The service here was great, the sushi was pretty good, the environment was nice and I will be back!"", ""Note: My experience here is identical to my experience at the other location in St. Petersburg so my review is the same.  I love PJ's!  I usually get the shrimp scampi which is very good.  It's definitely worth the price because there's a good portion of shrimp, plus it comes with garlic bread and two sides.  I get the salad and French fries as my side which are very good.  The onion rings are also very tasty - just make sure you ask for them extra crispy.  The servers are always nice and the food is consistent.  The atmosphere is great.  Usually waits in season (winter) so you may need to make reservations."", ""My favorite Mexican restaurant in Indy. No, it's not perfect but it's great food, great service and a really cool dining room. The East Washington neighborhood is not great but not scary during the day. I love to pop over from downtown on my lunch hour for a great break from the chains, but I don't think I would bring my family here at night. It is a little pricey but not horrible for downtown. And you get what you pay for. Everything I've ordered has been fresh and yummy. Co-workers from South America say it's very authentic, too. I just know I like it!"", ""What is this the worst overpriced airport food breakfast sandwich?  Why yes, yes it is.  Look I realize airport food is what it is on all price and flavor accounts but, this was worse than anything I have ever eaten at an airport.  This was definitely assembled earlier in the morning and just reheated.  The bacon was limp and very under cooked and the slice of cheese wasn't even a Kraft cheese single but, a knock off cheese single.  The croissant wasn't fresh baked and you feel a little robbed when you are chewing on leather while having paid over $7.00 for just a sandwich.  The coffee was burnt and old in flavor; either that or it was instant and I am not sure which is true.  There are many more options in this place and if you can't find one grab a bag of Doritos instead and you will be happier,"", ""This review is for the front desk and the chef, Michael, from Cafe Elise. I got stuck flying with a package that the airlines were trying to force me to check. It was a painting that holds significant value to me. The airline told me to go up to UPS but they are closed on weekends. I panicked just a bit because I knew the airline would destroy it. (See YouTube baggage handling).   The guys at the restaurant and front desk had me fill out the form and locked my package in the office to be shipped Monday!

It was all because of the nail tech, i didn't get her name but she was young, Vietnamese with a med length bob haircut. I went in for a gel color polish change. Her work is not as neat as what im use to there. She for some reason placed two scolding hot towels over each of my hands while removing the old color. I told her that the towels were too hot and she than removed them and swung them in the air to cool off than reapplied. She than asked 'is this better princess \""\"".  Than she turned around and ask if that woke me up. I've had a gel polish color change several times before, no one has ever placed hot towels on my hands EVER,  i don't know why she did. After the gel color polish was applied and dry she repeatedly reapplied a top thick coat over and over. I kept having to place my hands under the uv light again, thats never happened before either.

This walk was magical. I don't know whether we simply got lucky but I've never encountered such an abundance of wildlife on one walk.  The swamp and marsh were beautiful. For much of our first walk we were on a raised pedestrian platform. For the later walk, it was a dirt path.   Along the way on our two hour walk we saw raccoons, gators, snakes, hundreds of lizards, frogs, dragon flies, birds of all kinds, and a family of four armadillos.   Incredible."", ""Had a wonderful time and great food was enjoyed by all in our Model A Group.  Excellent service, The Waiters and Waitresses were wonderful and very nice.  Will be back soon. Our compliments to the Chef. 6/11/2016.   Thanks so much for having us.  Dianne Hunter"", ""I really wanted to like Casselli's, but it wasn't in the cards. Maybe I just caught them on a bad night, but I didn't really enjoy much about my visit. The waiter was very unpleasant - was banging down the plates and glasses on the table when he delivered them. Maybe he was having a bad day, but I still would have expected better.   We had mixed experiences with the food. Mine and our friends' was OK, but my wife's baked ravioli would have been more use to a hockey team for use as pucks. They were really overdone - woefully overdone.   The worst part was that our table was next to the opera singer guy. He was singing extremely loudly and it was nigh impossible to maintain a conversation - especially coupled with how close we were to the table next to us and their attempts to speak over Opera Guy.  Part of me wants to give them another chance (since I hate writing bad reviews) and the other part is annoyed over the waiter's attitude. I probably will not go back. There are so many good Italian restaurants worth visiting that the opportunity cost of returning to Casselli's seems too high.  On the upside, they have somewhat convenient parking in the lot behind the restaurant (near the Shawmont School).  Note: cash-only."", ""Excellent food and service every time! Cornbread and corn pudding are awesome. The sauces are just right! Love this place!"", ""This is the best food I've had the whole time we've been at Nashville. In all seriousness the avocado toast with the home fries was the best I've ever had. The staff is amazing and we didn't have to wait  for a table. I wish we could eat this every day of our lives. Also my soy latte was AMAZING."", ""My only hesitation to write this review is that it's almost trendy to review Tria, but the biz shouldn't be punished for it...   My mistake is I passed by this place so many times thinking I should stop in, especially since it's packed, but figured the alcohol would be overpriced and food would be an expensive art project, at best. I was wrong.   Rarely do you stop at a place like this. I've been twice and both visits were everything I'd want for a nice, casual dining experience. The first time I went we were the only ones outside (it looked like it was going to rain... and it did). The servers offered to reseat us immediately but we actually opted to sit outside and watch the rain. Everything was covered so it wasn't like our server got drenched coming to our table. I had a salmon sandwich, she had a salad and we shared a cheese plate. Everything was portioned and presented very well. The wine and beer they recommend went with the lunch nicely - we had a great time, so we came back a month later. This visit was equally enjoyable. We sat at the sleek bar for a drink before being shown to our table. I feel this spot is the perfect W. Washington Square casual experience coupled with it's nearby neighbor Varga for the rowdier experience."", ""Cute little place! The front desk staff were so nice. Unfortunately they were completely full and I wasn't able to get a service there but I will definitely try again when I'm in Boise. Thumbs up for their customer service!  They even suggested and called another spa for me ... highly impressed with that.  I've been in the industry for over 20 years and their customer service went beyond what I expected.  Thank you, I loved your suggestion and they highly recommend you as well!"", ""Food is below average. Waiter is unfriendly.. I asked which dishes are less spicy, he said dismissively: all of them are spicy because Indian food is spicy.. OK, they never brought a chutney tray and we never asked. They constantly were out of naan which wasn't very flavorful. Yeah, that's the last time for us. The decor was colorful. That's what the one star is for."", ""I love this place.  A very welcome addition to the downtown scene.   Walking in, I am immediately struck by how pretty the place is.  Lots of wood, muted colors... very calming.  Add to that the eclectic mix of music, albeit heavy on classic jazz - Miles, Coltrane, Theolonius - and some classic blues - Billie Holiday, Nina Simone... the overall effect is soothing.  After a hectic day at work, sipping a glass of wine at the bar, I feel like I wandered into a little oasis. I grew up in NYC, so this place definitely takes me back to rainy days in the city where jazz just seemed to be the perfect expression of the day.  So, enough about the atmosphere.  Let's talk about what truly makes unplugged special - the booze. Before writing this review, I have been to unplugged four times.  Every time, I have sat at the bar versus a table.  Nothing wrong with the tables there, but to anyone who knows me then you know what a chatty Cathy I can be .    Frank, the owner and frequently the bartender, is an absolute joy to chat with about wine.  My first time going here, I ordered a flight of whites.  I was so impressed that Frank poured each glass and then explained a little about the wine I was about to taste.  He then waited until I finished the glass I had before pouring the next.  His passion and knowledge of wine are clearly evident.  In subsequent visits, I have always sat at the bar to be able to chat with Frank or whomever is bartending.  All of the staff that I have encountered have always been warm, knowledgeable, and passionate about wine.  Speaking of the wine... I love that their wines are unusual.  Since Frank is a native German, it is not at all surprising that many of the wines are German.  However, don't expect to see only Rieslings.  There are Gewurtz's, Spatleses, Kabinetts, and a bunch of beautiful German reds that are both unexpected and delightful.  Speaking of the Rieslings, their selection ranges from the traditional sweet and mineral wines to some surprisingly dry one also.  Last night, I had an amazing red - a blend of mostly Grenache, a little Syrah, and a little Mourvedre (an oft overlooked but delightful grape).    While their wines are a bit pricier by the glass or bottle than what you might expect to pay at Good Oak or Congress, the quality in astronomically better.  If you're on a budget, ask for the house white or house red as they are always fantastic (and nothing like what you might expect of a house wine at a different establishment)."", ""Perfect spot in Nashville! So sad it will be gone soon! Perfect mix of dive bar and music! Everyone was friendly ! We tried to get back later but the rain got the best of us!"", ""All I needed was a written estimate.  A rather simple task one would think.  I needed my factory navigation unit in my Denali replaced, and needed to know costs and in writing.  Now this is a normal standard procedure for an auto repair shop.  Let's just assume its bad (it is), so tell me how much it is to remove bad part, and put the new one in.  Jay Fatimo or something like that, said he was very busy, as were the other service writers, so he handed me his card, and said to just email him with what I needed.  Sounded like a good plan, I wasn't in a big rush.  So I did just that, sent a picture of my vin, and the appropriate RPO codes to know what part I needed, and emailed it all to him.  I never got a response.  I tried again about a week or so later, still nothing.  Made sure it is his email at the dealership, etc.    I guess I have a hard time with taking my car in or trusting a place to do such repairs (3000 dollar job according to Winkel GMC) if they can't even respond to an email.  He knew I would email that day, and I did.    I guess the GMC dealer right next door gets my money instead."", ""We love Philly and go every New Years Eve. We have experienced many hotels in the area ... this by far was our worst. The location is ok, not great. Their are some restaurants ( El Rey, continental) within walking distance. (walking distance to us is 5-10 blocks). The parking is $36 a day. The valet was polite and did there jobs. Front desk was nice and did there jobs as well. No issues with the staff. The lobby is misleading.The room size is average but the bathrooms are small and nonfunctional. The bed sucks no polite way to say it, first night I was up every hour due to the discomfort. REQUEST extra pillows! Was not super clean either in the bathroom. The rooms are not sound proff!!!! We could hear a couple fighting on top of us. To the point where we had to go to the lobby because we thought he was killing her. We could hear full conversations. Now this also explains the people who frequant the hotel.  This point is even more illistrate by the fact when we brought the fight to the attention of the staff they were not phased. I know it was New Years but listening to a girl getting choked out was not a good time actually it was a buzz kill. So we will never stay here again."", ""Well, I visited UAL for the first time today because I wanted to see what the big deal was about.  Man, was I glad that I did!  What a place, full of great items at incredibly low prices.  Yes, some of the high end designer clothes are still pricy anyway you look at it, but still a super deal.  I tend to go into \""\""overload\""\"" in discount places such as this with large inventories, but the critical difference between UAL and other places is the service that is received.  I was amazed when I walked in to have someone come immediately up to me, tell me about the place , where things are located and offer any assistance.  Melody, the owner was there today and she worked with me to assure that I found just what I was looking for, brought clothes to the dressing room and suggested that I try on things that I never would have chosen if I was on my own.  I walked out with a great summer dress for 39.00, some Velvet camisoles and great jewelry.  This place is a find!  I will be going back regularly to feed my new UAL addiction."", ""This place made me want to move to Boise. Everyone was very friendly, and the space is beyond cool.

Our server, Ashley, was not interested in providing any semblance of customer service...RUDE! We had a simple question about the beers on special and she became quite defensive. My daughter spilled her drink, which I realize is a pain in the ass for the restaurant and server (although we were outside so it wasn't that big a deal). We apologized profusely but she didn't even try to hide her annoyance. Finally, the chicken quesadilla should have been labeled the gristle quesadilla....more fat than actual meat...yuck.

I have the dish ranked as good as any mac and cheese I have tried. It is in a tie with Beechers (locations in New York and Seattle). The pork belly and \""\""Banh mi\""\"" Gulf Fish Tacos are excellent. The lamb sliders and sweet potato gnocchi with Louisiana crab are very good too.  Of course, Three Muses also has live jazz performances. The music is fantastic. I arrived at the gastropub ten minutes before it opened so I could get a seat at the bar immediately.

Awesome!), keeping our coffees refilled, and keeping us updated on the status of our drink and food orders. Everything came out perfectly and pretty quickly.   Our food was excellent, and serving gravy on the side for chicken and waffles is a fantastic idea. The heuvos rancheros were nice and light, and our request for sriracha was gladly met.

First of all, there is a $3 charge for any order over $40 which isnt that bad but you would figure the there wouldn't be a charge for large orders since we're spending a lot.   Never the less we took our dinner home excited for our new found BBQ place. We got a half slab, a chicken crisper and rib platter, a brisket platter, and a Tennessee triple platter. Starting with the slab, unbelievably dry and the sauce was ketchup with Worcestershire sauce. They have this coating that I've never seen and I'm assuming it's because they were smoked, however it made eating them almost impossible. The chicken was dry and had gristle which was surprising since it was pulled. The sauce again, ketchup and Worcestershire. The brisket...the worst I've ever had.

I practically tried everything for breakfast and have come to the conclusion that this is the spot for breakfast. I have one gripe though, the monte cisto is not worth the price and is way over priced. I know truffle oil is used but that should not be the reason its so damn expensive. one egg, one piece of toast and some sauce. Don't ever order it, not worth it unless they drop the price $5. everything else is worth it taste great. Jebbs open face and the huevos rancheros are my favs. Enjoy. oh and the coffee is addicting.

I could eat here everyday it is so tasty! Great service, a bit small but still nice to eat in!"", ""Okay, I'm obsessed with the chocolate pancakes from IHOP but they are not worth it when the service is SHIT. My server comes to the table asked me what I wanted to order for a drink, I ask a few questions about the mimosas.

This man was older so he had no excuse for his ignorance. I am so disappointed with this establishment. If I could give negative stars I would. Do not go here, it is not worth it."", ""Think twice before renting from Event Rental -- they regularly and knowingly overcharge their customers. Make sure you know exactly what services are being performed, and pay close attention to your bill. Their business policy and practice is to fraudulently charge customers for work not performed whenever there are back to back events.  Long story relatively short: tents were rented three days in a row at a venue for three separate parties (one day for each party). Mine was the middle day (Saturday). I was charged almost $250 (a third of my total cost, which they make you pay upfront) for delivery and \""\""after-hours\""\"" pickup (labor fees) for my Saturday event at a venue, even though I realized about a week after my event that the same tents were standing on both the day before (Friday day and through the night) and the day after (the tents stayed standing through Saturday night and through Sunday morning). So basically, they set up the tents on Friday, left them up through the weekend until sometime on Sunday, and then charged each of the three parties separately for the full cost of delivery/pickup labor. After many attempts to call and speak to a manager and never receiving a call back, I was told there was nothing they could do about it -- one employee even stated explicitly that it is the company's standard procedure to charge each separate client for the full price of delivery and pickup, even if only one delivery and one pickup each are performed for a weekend consisting of three different events. So after many days of no return calls and no communication from upper management or any admission of wrongdoing, I had to file a claim with my credit card company.  It's clearly a dishonest way of conducting business (\""\""scam\""\"" is the correct word), and when I confronted them about it in a respectful manner, they refused to admit any wrongdoing and ignored the issue until I got the credit card company involved."", ""Ordered some food at 11:47pm after not eating all day due to airline issues. I was starving. 2 and 1/2 hours later my food was delivered after I called twice looking for it.  When it arrived, there was no utensils or napkins.  I ate my salad with my fingers.

Top marks all around"", ""This place is great in theory but the execution borders on offensive. I'm admittedly fresh from an interaction with front desk manager Ali, who --when I asked why my room wasn't made up despite my  calling housekeeping, stopping by the front desk and activating the green \""\""make up room\""\"" button -- behaved as though making the bed, cleaning the bathroom and replenishing the tea supply was far above and beyond the call of duty for a hotel despite a guest asking three times for them to do their job. In less time than I spent requesting the service, i could have cleaned my own room. Worse still she accused me three times during two conversations of likely not knowing the difference between the green service button and the red do not disturb button. A lovely housekeeper who was nice enough to come up at 2am to bring me tea and towels for the morning saw the green button was on.     No one knows the hotel policies or amenities and I got a different answer every time I asked a question.   The binder in the room indicates that I can either use the in-room safe or a safety deposit box located at the concierge desk. When I asked the concierge to give me use of the safety deposit box, they said they had no idea what I was talking about and said maybe the front desk has that service. The front desk said there's no such safe deposit box and explained to me very slowly as tho I was a complete moron that im obviously confusing the box in my closet with a safe deposit box. No one has read their own guest binder.   The binder and literature also says there is a pool. There is not. There is not a even single place to sit or walk outside, and not just because construction is going on for the next 3 years. They could have provided some small deck or garden  area for guests to go for a breath of fresh air, since there are no balconies or windows that open.   There was turn down service on my first night here but not the second or third. Had they been providing what they claim to, they'd have been able to alert housekeeping that my green \""\""make up room\""\"" light had been on for nine hours. I don't really care if my bed gets made, but if nothing is done despite the signal outside the door, \u00e0 call (and voicemail) to housekeeping and physical visit to the front desk where I was assured the room was serviced, that's just bad management.    Post script: I was trying to sleep in after a late night and between 9:30 and 10:30 am the housekeepers were chatting loudly in the hall outside my room and in the adjoining room. I did not so much mind being awakened by their work, as much as terrified when -- after id dozed back off -- they repeatedly tried to open my door despite the red light being illuminated for DO NOT DISTURB. I called the front desk who put me in touch once again with housekeeping where I left a voicemail. It's like no one is in charge of this place. Not hospitable.    The gym is decent and security, bellmen and casino personnel were all lovely."", ""I've been to a lot of Pho Restaurant but this is the worst one....  I've been to this restaurant 2 times....  First experience, I would like to try the new place after porkie the Korean BBQ closed.....and they over charged the bill.....The bubble drink is supposed to be $3.50 but they add an extra $3.....When I asked why they said Oh it's because we put the tapioca.....The drink itself already serve w/ the tapioca; therefore I do not understand why the extra charge is necessary.....  The second time, I gave another try......I went with 11 people and ordered their pho......I found out that the flanks were shining green.....which was clear to me that the meat quality is bad....it has FUNGI....they're ROTTEN!!!!  The worst thing was that it was not only my bowls but also others....So we asked the server NICELY if we could just changed all to the rice dishes instead and pay the extra.....but the first thing they did, flew to the kitchen and brought us the rare flank and argue that the meat was fine.....Like duhhhh one bowl is ok but it's like all 8 BOWLS WITH ROTTEN MEAT!!!!  Then the other server said, Oh I'm in charge and we couldn't change the food because it's already in the system....Excuse me, but I'm not there to eat for free and I said I'M GOING TO PAY FOR THE EXTRA CHARGES.....  We dealt with this for more than 20 minutes....just want to proof that they were right.......clearly they had no idea how to dealt with their customers....NO APOLOGIZE...NOTHING AND JUST KEPT ARGUING..... Definitely the worst dinner ever.....and WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this place at all to anybody.....I believe that you do not want to pay for rotten meat..... Better go to Viet Huong or Nam Phuong across from them....it's way better with the same price, better food quality and better service!"", ""From the looks of it, Helzberg really don't care much about the social media comments and their customer's satisfaction. Today my wife and I just came out of Macy's cancel one of the ring I bought her for Valentine's Day due to wrong size. I already knew their services have gone to the gutter in recent years, its worse than going to a car dealership, where you get judged by their superficial eyes. If they don't think you are going to buy, they don't want to waste a second on you. So I told the first lady who greet us straight up, I was looking for a diamond ring around $800, I showed her the picture of the ring we cancelled at Macy's, all I asked is something comparable in price for a gold diamond ring. She showed me one right away but the diamond was a lot smaller than what we were looking for.  But she was able to find another one, not perfect, but at least my wife liked. I asked her what is the best price she can give us, after some negotiation, she said there is a $150 discount, and because we were still unsure (the diamond was still a lot smaller than the one in Macy's for similar price), she said she would throw in resizing service for free. It was already around noon time, both of us were hungry and I didn't want to rush a decision like this, so I told her we will think over lunch and be back if we decides.   So later that evening, I got the chance to go out alone, so I went back to the store to make the purchase. Right away I made the mistake telling the ladies that are working there I was there earlier, talked to a tall older lady, and I'm ready to make the purchase. At the time there were three of them, one was busy with the customer, one was on the phone, then there is a lady completely free. But you can tell right away she does not want to help me since I was already here before, even she get some commission it will not be the whole commission. So she told me go talk to the lady on the phone... Then the lady on the phone doesn't seem to have any interest helping me either, kind of yelling across from the store to the other \""\""free\""\"" lady something I didn't even pay attention. So I'm standing in the middle of them feeling unwanted by those two. Finally the first free lady ask me whats my name blah blah... after wasted few more minutes she finally asked me which ring. So I pointed to the ring and told her what price was promised me earlier. Again she asked my name (for what reason I don't know), then she asked me if I had the other lady's card (I wasn't very happy with the first lady's service to begin with, she often answered my question in a snobbish way as if we couldn't afford the more expensive ring like \""\""oh that's $3000....\""\"" in a condescending tone. So even when I told her we will think over lunch she didn't bother to give me her card.    By now, the evening lady was trying to hint to the other lady I had no reference maybe she should just sell to me like a regular sale. The other lady obviously doesn't want her to get the complete commission (also it is breaking the industry rule). While all of them keep having the tone I was just making up the price which I was promised from the morning lady! So I said maybe you should call her up, most sales people who care about their commission wouldn't mind the phone call.  At first the evening lady doesn't seem want to (too much work to make a call you know), finally the other lady also suggest she should call. So she went to the back room for roughly 5 to 10 minutes (don't know why she couldn't just call right front of me, the phone is right there!)  She comes back and told me there are not even a $150 discount (even though there is advertisement for $50 off on $299 purchase, and we always get their catelog in the mail, usually is $50 for every x amount of purchase, the ring originally is $900, which made sense when the morning lady quoted $150 discount). On top of that, there is a free $300 speaker promotion going on for anything over $600, and the morning lady said I can chose $150 discount or the $300 speaker.   Anyway, my point of writing this review isn't even about not getting the originally quoted price, I sincerely hope who ever runs Helzberg Diamonds's marketing, online marketing, social media marketing or even if just the store manager who actually care about his or her store image, can take a look at their staff. The culture they are building has changed so much since we bought our wedding band over 10 years ago. I read few other people's review, they shared the similar feeling. Their staff are just bunch of vulchers.  I worked a commission job throughout my college years, I don't know what happened in recent years. these people on commission doesn't understand how to treat their customers, and just expect the customers pay their paycheck. This mindset became very sickening to the society! And they only pride on Mr Warren Buffeft's name but not his vision!"", ""*note* I wrote a similar review on tripadvisor. I really wanted to like this hotel- it was charming and in a great location, with cute, unique rooms. It was just my style. Unfortunately, some blood-sucking insects ruined that. Yup- bed bugs. We found them the morning we were leaving, because they normally come out very early in the morning (we were up at 530). Bleck! The management let us stay as long as necessary to take care of the issue (ie throwing away a bunch of our stuff and bagging the rest in ziplocks to be boiled) but it didn't change the fact that it was gross and a huge inconvenience. I threw away about $300 worth of clothing, shoes and luggage and I'm still worried that we brought the creatures back to our house with us.  I would never stay here again, and I would urge you to think twice about it. Without seeing every carpet and mattress in the place replaced, there's no way I'd trust that the bugs were gone."", ""Just meh ramen, having people wait outside in line, in the sun, is in fact a stupid idea (even though management was so petty they put a sign on the door stating it's not a dumb idea). The wait staff sucked, couldn't get a refill on drinks the entire time we were there, and the server told me not to use Sriracha or I would ruin my meal, kid please, I know what I like, if I want Sriracha give me the dang sauce.

And would you know, she spoke, too! lol. It takes one positive moment to outweigh every other trivial thing.

Great history and antiques, comfy beds, very clean. The pool area is great though it can get a bit crowded. We were there during jazz fest, and several band members and their relatives hung out at the pool.... fun just eavesdropping from the next chaise lounge! The Carousel Bar is also a must do."", ""Food and music were both fabulous. Our large group ordered a wide variety of dishes and we were very happy with all of them."", ""We came to eat last night with a pretty large party (9 people).  Being in a large party in a busy restaurant, you expect things to take a bit longer than normal. We were fine with that, given that this place came highly recommended.  We were seated within about 30 minutes, which was not bad given how busy they are. After sitting there for about 25 minutes, we had yet to be approached by a waiter. We let the hostess know and she sent a waiter over to us. He said that he would bring us all waters and be right back.   Around this time, another large party was seated at the table next to us. They appeared to have 7 people, which was confirmed when the waiter brought our waters to their table and mysteriously ended up with 2 extra glasses... A minute or two after that, a different waiter showed up and apologized, saying there was a mixup with the table assignments.  We figured that it'd be a good idea to go ahead and order while we actually had somebody's attention and placed our appetizer, food and drink orders and asked for waters. That waiter was never seen or heard from again, though... 20 more waterless minutes passed (45 minutes in total by this point) and we were tired of waiting..  To add insult to injury, though, the other large table that I mentioned had their drinks and appetizers delivered just then.  One person from our party approached the manager to complain and was basically just told, \""\""we're busy\""\"". Yes, restaurants get busy and food may take a while, but 45 minutes and not even water? Needless to say, we just left and enjoyed a very good meal at Coop's Place a few blocks down.  It's not often that I feel compelled to leave a review, but this is definitely one of those occasions. It's funny how many reviews over the past year or two echo the exact same problems we experienced last night. You would expect management to take corrective actions, but I suppose they don't care as long as butts are still being put in seats."", ""Omg you would think that the drinks would be strong so that you wouldn't notice how bad the food is but no such luck.

We got two stories - one was none at all just \""\""sorry\""\"", the other was the group came in claimed the table and told the staff they were friends of the owner and they'd cause trouble if removed from the table.  Doesn't matter to me because if the latter is true the owner needs new friends since the current ones will put them out of business, and if the former is just ineptness on the part of staff they'll be out of business.

When the food finally came, the Roast Pork sandwich and fries were completely cold (guess that was the half that was done on time).  The pork was fine, but the roll just average and the gravy was awful.  Fries, meh.  Cheese Steak filling looked like ground beef and was a miniscule portion in a large grinder roll.

At this point I was pretty much over this guys bad attitude and wanted to just walk out of there but my husband was pretty upset as he really wanted BBQ so we ordered off line from the foodcab.net since we could use our credit card.   When we finally got the food to us it was bland and dry. even my cat turned her nose up too it. The corn bread was less like a side dish and more like a dessert.   I physically feel ill after eating this slop as does my husband."", ""Our first time is our last time.  Worst margaritas we've had anywhere.  What Mexican restaurant can't make a good margarita??  Each of our meals was boring and unauthentic.  My burrito came wrapped in a piece of foil served on a plate (felt like I had hit a drive thru).   No sides...just one chicken burrito for $9.99.   When we tried to use our $3 off $15 coupon we were told we couldn't use it.  Really?  After spending almost $50 on three regular margaritas and two entrees (no appetizers and no desserts and yes it cost that much).   Extremely overpriced, poor service, boring food."", ""I walked in at 9:30 on a Tuesday and the owner told me they were closed. They need to change the hours online and lock the doors when they're closed."", ""This is some of the rudest, most unprofessional  service I have ever seen. The waitress was in a foul mood as soon as we entered the restaurant. She seemed upset when we didn't order more than pizzas. When she returned with plates for the pizza, she gruffly dropped them on the table. She never offered to refill our drinks, she seemed more concerned with playing with her cell phone. She dumped the bill on our table without saying a word. Do not support a business that mistreat customers this way."", ""Went on a Monday to have a daiquiri and watch a little bit of the NBA basketball game.  Asked the young lady working if she would be willing to turn on the game and was told she was watching Netflix.  I guess customer service is not important anymore.

There is a \""\""teacher\""\"" watching, but I don't think they are any better since the \""\""teacher\""\"" messed up my cut more than the student did.  The haircuts are cheap, so if you are looking for something really affordable and want to take your chances, then go for it.  It will really all depend on how good of a student you have and how ready they are at that time to be a real stylist/barber.  My cut just so happened to turn out horribly, but I prepared myself for that since I knew what I was getting myself into.  Just prepare yourself for the same if you decide to take a chance to get a cut here.  DO NOT do it if you definitely need to get a good cut for an event or something because it can potentially turn out to be tragic!"", ""Top 10 worst restaurant experiences of all time!  Stopped in for lunch this Sunday afternoon. I had seen the reviews about bad service here but was driving and figured WTH, let me give it a try. I am sorry i did.   I walk in and the toothpick chewing attendant is sitting on a stool. Sees me but continues to play with his phone. After an awkward 2 min staring contest motions me to 'sit where ever' wave. Brings over a cracked plastic glass with his palm covering and touching the rim of my glass and warm pitcher of water. Ordered boneless Chicken Korma was brought out by a waiter in a small cereal bowl with another small cereal bowl of microwaved rice in which we had his thumb. I wanted to walk out but honestly felt sorry for the guy given the restaurant only had one other party of three dinning on a Sunday Afternoon. Food was horriable. Instead of Chicken Korma i was given what tasted like Chicken Makhni curry over spiced and over salted to look like Chicken Korma. Waiter disappears and emerged with three fingers on a plate plopped it down and disappeared forever. I ate about a quarter of the meal and literally felt like throwing up. The meat was a mixture of white and dark meat left over from thigh or other parts (was odd shaped and some was shredded). Rice quality was good but it was tortured dry in a microwave before it was served. Asked for check. Paid and then told the attendant that i was sorry but meal was not that good. His reply \""\""Okay...thanks....\""\""   For what i got and what i paid ($13) it was not only a rip off but an insult. Not once did ANYONE come over to ask if everything was ok. Rocky tables were stabilized with folded paper napkins, napkin holders on all tables are MIA. Napkins are just piled on a table with salt shakers to hold them down. How much are plastic glass and napkin holders at Ikea or Restaurant Depot? ts obvious these people don't give a crap about customers and dont have a clue about service. When they do close their doors, they will have no one to blame but themselves!"", ""I'm not particularly a fan of the Century Hospitality restaurants and I hadn't been to a Deluxe BB location in a few years so I decided to give it another shot the other week.   The atmosphere is cool but when you bite into the burger it is such a let down. Their overpriced burgers (and sides) are so disappointing that it brings tears to my eyes. Nobody in my party enjoyed their eats and nobody would come back.   The burgers sounds delicious from the description but in reality they are boring, dry, and void of any sort of flavor. I don't know how the Century Group can keep these locations afloat let alone keep expanding.   It's really not that hard to make even a decent burger and somehow Deluxe Burger Bar fails. DO NOT GO."", ""Very poor service, very greasy pizza. The pizza I ordered didn't even have the same toppings as described in the menu.  The table was never wiped, the food sat for several minutes in view before it was delivered.  The table next to us had dirty dishes on it almost the whole time.  I think everything else in the Indianapolis airport is better."", ""My family and I love Chipotle!   We choose this chain most often when considering fast food.   This particular location was terrible.   We ordered ahead and first of all the order was wrong.   And may I ask how does a Mexican restaurant run out of guacamole??   and run out of taco shells?  and run out of the pepper and onion stir fry mix?   Also, the service was very slow.   The food was thrown together and not in the usual way.    My son called to tell them about the order when he got home, and the person on the phone didn't care.   I have nothing good to say about this dining experience."", ""Terrible Service! I went there with a co worker around 5pm to get drinks using a giftcard I got from RiteAid.com. I've been there a couple times because their chicken fingers are delicious! When I got there, I told the bartender that I had 2 /$10 coupons(only because it didnt allow me to buy $20), she said I could only use one coupon per month. So I said 'okay well then we'll just be getting some drinks.'  She never said anyrhing else. So when we get the bill, the owner came over and told me to never come back!! All because we didnt order food and he thought I was scamming him!! (If she said we had to buy food then we would have) Then said shouted that doesn't support alcoholism! (But owns a bar) I can't believe because I had 3 beers after work on a Monday, I'm considered an alcoholic! The bill was about $18 and I was going to give a good tip but.... I'm never going back. Just like another review I saw for this place- \""\""These people judge a book by its cover.\""\"" If you don't want people to use the coupons!! don't offer to be on the website!!. It's simple. Such bad business!"", ""Been to this location twice and will never go back again!!!!  First time was mediocre, the second time was so very disappointing it beggars belief. I ordered some ribs and had to send them back because one half was warm and the other half was refrigerator cold. They came back and one side was really hot and the other side was still cold, third time it was edible. The manager came over the third time to apologize, never once offered to comp anything. I'm not the kind of guy to cause a fuss to get something comped, but to send something back three times to get it cooked properly and only get an insincere apology really pisses me off, enough for me to write this review."", ""Great beer, delicious food. Was pleasantly surprised to find a fruity beer on the menu, and it was raspberry. Wings had good flavor. We couldn't make up our minds on the burgers so we got two and each had a half. I did not want to give up the other half of the Bang Bang burger. It was so damn good! The Fire Starter was no joke. Holy hot! Get the beer battered fries, they're great."", ""Went here based on the high ratings and raves from people.  The entire experience was underwhelming from start to finish.  Their website which is fairly useless if you want to figure out the menu before going, you have to pick your location choice out of 3 locations and then drill down to the bottom to see the weak descriptions of their menu offering, no explanations and no price, just this      Roast Beef     Roast Beef Combo     Roast Pork     Roast Pork Combo     Baked Ham     Baked Ham Combo     Roast Turkey     Roast Turkey Combo     Broccoli Rabe     Broccoli Rabe Combo   No explanation of whats in a combo (its just where they add cheese by the way)  The table placecard (instead of menu) had a more detailed description than the website.    When I walked in, its more bar than restaurant, no big deal, but there were tables.  Since I couldnt decide and the sandwiches werent too expensive at $6.85, I got the roast beef and roast port combos.  I got my two sandwiches fast enough, but the roast beef was cold and the roast pork was hot.  Not sure how a cook (for lack of a better word) could serve 2 things at the same time with such a temperature differential, one was obviously sitting for awhile.  I asked the waitress to reheat the roast beef while I finished the roast pork, and supposedly it was reheated, since it was warmer, but it was still cold-ish compared to my roast pork I had just finished.  The waitress did offer to replace it when she inquired, but I was in a hurry and didnt really care for a hot version of this sandwich.  The sandwiches were very skimpy on meat, but they \""\""made up for it\""\"" by adding too much gravy to make it overly messy and the bread was disintegrating.  The menu place card mentions the \""\""wet meat\""\"" option where you get less gravy, I strongly recommend you get it that style, especially if the gravy overpower the meat and structural integrity of the sandwich."", ""I stopped going this BK and usually avoid all BK.  I don't know if all BK are like this one or is this location uniquely bad. Whenever you pass by you never see many cars so you get tricked into thinking that you could get in and out fast. When they do answer to take your order, its never friendly or welcoming. Once i thought i heard someone say \""\""Yea, what u want\""\"" but i will give the benefit of the doubt i miss heard. Nothing i order is complicated or special request so you would think it wouldn't take long. It seems as if they don't start until you have paid, because they ask for me to pull around. I understand if they were busy or off hours or something reasonable, but no. You can hear them holding conversations, that if were management they would be fired on the spot. You get a sense of not being welcomed as if your inconveniencing them. Then after waiting, they bring your order to your car and say nothing. No sorry for the wait, or bla bla. I have learned the hard way to not leave until you check your food to make sure its 100%. 9 out of 10 times my order is wrong in some way. Either something is missing or they ignored my request all together.  You then decide is it worth the possible wait time and rude service or just take it and leave.  The last time i left i swore to never go back. If someone from management reads this, if you want to know why your store is dying. Look at your employees first, then quality control."", ""One of the worst customer service I have ever experienced at any Toyota service center! Twice in the past half year, I have had very poor customer service here. The first time was when I bought my car in specifically asking for an inspection of my right front tire, informing them it had been leaking air a few days ago and I had to pull over to get air pumped in. They found nothing... only 2 days later, that same tire went completely flat. I took my car to a local auto shop, and they found a huge nail stuck in the tire that would've been found if Toyota had done a careful inspection the first time.  Second experience was even worse and more shocking. I took my car in for servicing on a Saturday morning. The service person could not answer many of my questions, and when he stated that he was new, I kindly asked him how long he'd been working there (thinking that if he was so new that he didn't know a lot of info, that I'd ask another representative to help me). Out of nowhere, he yelled out in an extremely rude and angry manner,  \""\""That's none of your business ! ... I won't have you harrassing me...\""\"" Everyone in the room was startled and turned around to see why he was shouting so loudly.  Perhaps he acted this way because there was no manager on duty, however, this behavior is customer service at its worst. As a person in the service industry myself (I am a physician and my patients' health, safety and satisfaction come first), I am shocked by his blatantly inappropriate and unacceptable behavior. This behavior reflects poorly on his company, and I hope nothing like this happens to any other customers in the future. I went to another shop to have my car serviced, where customers would be treated more politely and with respect."", ""OK, I'm going to be Debbie Downer.  Awful coffee. Just awful.  Maybe that's not fair. I have yet to sample all of their fare, and perhaps it's a bad idea to fit them into the mold that Mugshots (which was gone before I arrived in Manayunk) occupied. But in the end, they call themselves a cafe, which translates into a coffee shop, moved into the location of a former coffee shop and they include baked goods and coffee on the menu, so I feel comfortable in holding them to some standard.  They were out of their banana bread. All of it. For all the flavors they described, they didn't have a single one left when I arrived. This is a significant portion of their menu, and they were out of all of it, which tells me that they have problems with keeping things in stock They had plenty of Baklava, but I'm allergic to two of the nuts they use in them, so even experimenting is a horrible idea.  There was a small child running around screaming, and I could hear arguing breaking out as I stepped through the door with my coffee. I'm not saying that without empathy, but that is never something you want your customers getting to be a part of. Even if the food had been perfect, it would have detracted from the experience  And...the coffee...I have to  go back to that. I really do. If I has handed a mug of Starbucks and was told that someone had urinated in it, and my only other option was what I had here...I would seriously have to debate that decision. This is a horrible thing to say. It's cruel, and cruel honestly isn't that much more helpful than well meaning lies. It's even more horrible to look at in the cold light of day, and determine that it's still a correct assessment. But this is someone who, during his broke college days, would drink coffee through day old grounds. Someone who used an abandoned French press that was held together with duct tape, and I couldn't finish it. Seriously, it was that bad. I don't know how they did it, and that cup was an accomplishment in of itself.  Maybe the owners are nice folk. Maybe, their Mediterranean food is really good, as other reviews seem to indicate. But they sure as shit ain't a cafe. If they want to be cheery, and have great falafel, they should do that. But dear God in heaven, who I have forsaken in so many ways, they put something on the menu so bad I am still  shocked. Combined with a lack of stock and that atmosphere, I can't possibly give this place a good rating."", ""I love Mint! I've only ever had good meals here. Fairly priced, delicious food, good vegetarian options."", ""This is the worst bar experience I've ever had. I'll try to be brief. The three beers I tried to order last night were Sierra Nevada, Sweetwater 420, and Sam Adams Boston Lager. I drink these beers regularly draft and bottle and I am very familiar with them.   I ordered a Sierra Nevada and it came out flat and warm. My friend ordered a Yazoo Pale Ale and received a cloudy, orange colored, spicy smelling blue moon.   We sent them back and ordered Sweetwater 420 instead. They where also flat and warm.  The manager said their must be a problem with the draft system and offered us bottled beer instead. I ordered my standard choice of Sam Adams figuring it was a safe bet.  He returned  with a brown bottle with NO LABEL and quickly put it on the table without saying anything or apologizing and walked away. When I took a sip it was one of the same flat warm beers that came out of the draft, I couldn't quite identify it, but it wasn't Sam Adams. I realized that they had filled an empty bottle with Sam Adams. When I realized this bottle probably came out of the recycling I stood up an left. I'm still deciding if I'm going to call the Nashville Health Department on Monday.    I understand mistakes happen, and so I was polite and patient with them. In return, I've never been more disrespected by any restaurant or bar. Any other place would have thanked me for pointing out the issue and taken care of it."", ""The food is barely edible.

There were about 4 of us on the table who had not ordered yet and we asked if he can take our orders first instead while my friend made up his mind but no...he said we had to follow the order we were seated.

No big deal, but no apology, just more hysterically loud laughter and napkin throwing. The guy noticed my son eyeing the candy and yelled at him not to touch anything. I get it, no one wants sandy little hands in the candy. But he wasn't touching anything, so this was just rude. We stood at the counter and the girl begrudgingly served us, no smile, no greeting, she didn't even look at us. Perhaps she was annoyed we had interrupted her flirting.

In our group, there were two adults and four children, ages 14, 13, 5 and 3. The waitress brought our drinks and took our order quite efficiently. When the food arrived, one five-stack of buttermilk pancakes were missing. My daughter had to sit and watch everyone eat for some time, while the waitress made promises each trip past our table. Knowing she was starving, I finally gave her one f my three pancakes so she had something in front of her while she waited.  Finally, her order arrived and she began eating. The waitress left my bill on the table - $54. I had ordered the Colorado Omelette which was quite good but when I finished most of it and started on my pancakes, I got a nasty nasty surprise. With the second bite of my pancakes, something felt wrong in my mouth. I reached in and found a hair. I started pulling it out of my mouth and it kept coming and coming, like a fishing line!!! UGH MY GAWD. The thing took both hands and turned out to be a curly reddish hair. It was not mine nor the waitresses as it had obviously been cooked into the pancake. This made me sick to my stomach, of course.  I called the waitress over and showed her. She quickly told me the hair did not match anyone on duty (WHO CARES ABOUT THAT? THE DAMN THING WAS IN MY FOOD!) She asked me if I wanted to speak to the manager and I said no, please just take this food away from the table. She did not ask me if I wanted a replacement (even though I would have said no, it would have been nice if she had offered). She came back to the table a few minutes later and picked up the $54 check, leaving another in its place. I thought maybe she had took my meal off of the bill but NO - now my total was $63.89. Listed as a service charge was $7.73 - she had included her own gratuity after the hair was found.   IHOP used to be my ultimate favorite restaurant but now it just makes my stomach churn and brings back a memory I cannot erase.

They thought i was an idiot and proceeded to tell me more bogus stuff I needed for my car like a filter (which I knew wasn't even my filter so they switched my air filter out and took mine!) and that I needed new wipers and I had just put new wipers on. They left my pristine clean engine a mess with fluids all over and dirtied my car and changed all the settings inside.

For the same price we could have gone to Commander's or Brennan's and could have got amazing food for the same price. Food here is beyond average."", ""Being a female I've never had to deal with tux shops until I/we started planning our wedding but you always hear the 'horror' stories of tuxes not fitting, pieces missing, pieces being dirty, stained, or damaged, somebody being charged for something, etc., so I was hoping we were one of the lucky ones that came out on the other side unscathed.    The planning process wasn't a grueling experience at all.  With 10 additional men in the wedding spanning 3 different states, it was extremely convenient for everybody to handle their tux at whatever location was most convenient for them.  Having any one of the other 10 tuxes be compromised in any way (wrong fit, dirty, damaged, missing pieces, etc.) would be an inconvenience and obviously not ideal for a wedding that you pay huge bucks for everything to be perfect.  During the 2 months leading up to the wedding all 11 men went in and got fitted on time with only a few of them needing alterations or different sizes, my husband's being one of them (just one piece of the tux was wrong).  The rest of the guys picked theirs up with no problem, which left them to screw up the one tux that actually mattered most.  When my husband went in the day before the wedding to pick up his tux they couldn't give it to him because they didn't have it.  With only one piece of the tux needing to be replaced earlier in the week, they somehow managed to lose or send out the whole tux.  My husband mentioned that they weren't even very apologetic about it, just that that was that and they'd overnight the tux so that it was to them by the morning.    Our wedding was a couple hours away so my husband had to miss out on a couple things with some of our family and friends because he had to wait at home to pick up his tux the morning of our wedding and then drive all the way to the where our wedding in time for the photographer, etc.    Fast forward a couple weeks and we get a card in the mail \""\""Congratulations on your wedding.  I personally would like to thank you for choosing Men's Wearhouse for your special day.  From all of us here, good luck and congratulations!\""\"" - \""\""Jason\""\"".  I instantly take notice to 2 very obvious things....  1-) Where's the apology? And 2-) The 12 year old chicken scratch that wrote the card was not Jason, the person who signed it.  Different print, different color ink.  \""\""I PERSONALLY would like to thank you....\""\"" ....not so personal anymore is it?  Somewhat of a slap in the face that they didn't somehow take note to their screw up and at least follow up with us via a phone call to make sure everything went well and to offer an apology.  Also a slap in the face that Jason Hartley, an \""\""Operations Manager\""\"", couldn't even write a card himself, given the circumstances.    To say I'm annoyed by this, would be an understatement.  I WILL say, however, that Jason is lucky my husband didn't tell me about all of this until after the tux was in hand and en route to the wedding (and on time) the morning of our wedding because otherwise, he wouldn't have gotten off so easily."", ""I stopped going this BK and usually avoid all BK.  I don't know if all BK are like this one or is this location uniquely bad. Whenever you pass by you never see many cars so you get tricked into thinking that you could get in and out fast.

Nothing i order is complicated or special request so you would think it wouldn't take long. It seems as if they don't start until you have paid, because they ask for me to pull around. I understand if they were busy or off hours or something reasonable, but no. You can hear them holding conversations, that if were management they would be fired on the spot. You get a sense of not being welcomed as if your inconveniencing them. Then after waiting, they bring your order to your car and say nothing. No sorry for the wait, or bla bla. I have learned the hard way to not leave until you check your food to make sure its 100%. 9 out of 10 times my order is wrong in some way. Either something is missing or they ignored my request all together.  You then decide is it worth the possible wait time and rude service or just take it and leave.

The chicken sandwich was absolutely delicious; the chicken was juicy with a crispy battered outside, the seasoning was nice and balanced, the touch of sauce was just right, and the potato bun was very fresh.

Since 90% of the menu items are BBQ, and that's the reason we came to this restaurant instead of the other local Korean restaurants, we asked to move to a BBQ table that worked.  We waited 15 more minutes and were seated at another table with one grill and placed the order, 7:45 at this point.  All the food came out but many of us  waited eagerly for food since they are grilling for 8 people on one small grill.  Finally everyone is served but then we sit for 20 more minutes waiting for someone to check back, offer boxes or the check.  They actually didn't ever come until one of us got up and requested it and it still took a while.  All in all a disaster of a night and will never go back.  I'd rather skip the BBQ and choose one of the many other excellent Korean restaurants in the area then sit through that again."", ""I've tried many ice cream shops in New Orleans and this one has made it to the top of my list. It has by far the best ice cream in town.   As soon as you walk through the doors you take a step back in time. It reminds me of many hollywood movies based in the South- it definitely has that old world charm.   There are so many delicious flavors to try and it's usually hard to choose just one.  However, over time and many flavor tests I find that I tend to gravitate to chocolate flavors. My personal favorites at the Creole Creamery are the entire chocolate section  (located on your left as soon as you walk in); more specifically, the chocwork-orange (a dark creamy chocolate ice cream with a hint of orange flavor), the butterscotch english toffee (soooo good) and lavender honey (who doesn't love lavender?)  What's your favorite flavor?"", ""As much as I adore food I am, typically, pretty easy when it comes to food and I forgive a lot. SO...one star means a lot! I haven't been as livid as I was leaving this fiasco of a restaurant in a long while. Reasons:  The server was on her cell phone from the minute we walked in to the minute we walked out (about 90 minutes). She literally had it on her shoulder the entire time except to say, \""\""Please hold\""\"" to take our orders. She was also the chef and cooked while talking on her bloody phone, as well. Service:  FAIL. My pork leg was tender and good which constitutes the lonely little star you see above. My husband ordered the shrimp, which cost $18.99. He received 7 shrimp that would be in a bag of 31-35 count...the size worthy of a salad shrimp. Again, $18.99...and the plantain portion of the meal consisted of 2 plantains the width of a postage stamp. Ridiculous. I then ordered tostones because I knew he would never be full with that quantity of food. I had to get up and find our server to add to my order as she was nowhere to be found.  They were also ridiculously thin, were over salted with an almost breaded and deep fried consistency. Food:  FAIL. I was going to order a Cuban coffee but the server was so non-existent that I just gave up, finally.  In retrospect, I'm happy I didn't order it because I'm sure it would have been just wrong. I would not frequent this restaurant again even if I had a free coupon. Don't waste your time or energy."", ""I haven't seen the book, but I think hotchickswithdouchebags.com is a hilarious website that.... Oops!  I forgot - this is a review for Pearl... in my defense, it's very easy to confuse the two.  I went to Pearl to see a DJ who I'd enjoyed at Silk City, but it was choch central and after one overpriced drink both my wallet and my soul were hurting."", ""Good, steady Saturday business but they're a bit slow. They only have one person doing the Pre-wash, and while thorough, it slows up the line.  No military discount, but they do offer one for law enforcement. Nice waiting area with tv, pinball, bowling game, Galaga and...Ms. Pac-Man!!! 5 stars for that!! However, they lose 4 of those stars for shabby work. My rims looked absolutely horrible! Apparently, the car washing gauntlet does not reach the wheels/rims. Additionally, they completely failed to wipe any of the brake dust from any of the 4 rims. I called one of the attendants to re-do the rims but the 2nd go round wasn't much more remarkable.  For the $25 \""\""St. Charles\""\"" wash, I'd like my rims to be washed and shining!  Do not EVER go here for your auto needs."", ""I've been going to Boise Therapeutic Massage for 4 years now.  I'm giving it 5 stars because I can always get an appointment the day I call, every therapist is exceptional, and the price is reasonable.  I've never been disappointed.  It isn't a fancy spa but their clinic is relaxing and the staff makes you feel welcome and I go for the massage and not the spa experience anyway.  I've started going to Amy exclusively for all my massages. It's wonderful when you find someone who knows where your trouble spots are and can make you feel human again."", ""I've been eating here when I'm in town for about 5 years and this place used to be great. The food has severely gone downhill in not only quality of ingredients but also in ability to prepare a dish. I ate here for lunch today, saying that so hopefully a member of the staff reads this and remembers me, I ordered the dry hot pot and my gf ordered fried dumplings and the cold noodles with chili oil and we shared each other's food. The mushrooms in my dish were impossible to cut even with a knife and the rest of the vegetables had a freeze dried feel to them being the consistency of bark. The pork was a bit rubbery and only had flavor from the oil draped over everything that seemed under seasoned as well and definitely tasted old. This was labeled in the menu as a 10/10 spicy rating, it was at most a 2. I didn't bother saying anything because of how rude the waiter/host was, but I'll get to that. The rice was cold and clumped together in chunks that led me to understand that it was previously microwaved. The dumplings looked ok, but the dough was undercooked and the sauce was just soy sauce that had no care whatsoever put into it. Her noodles were very bland and whoever prepared them obviously doesn't care about their food. The noodles had the same flavor deprived oil from my dish in it, just disappointing really. This type of food is supposed to be robust and I've eaten at a ton of places across the country and internationally that do care about what the put out. This place doesn't care anymore. The man that seated us was incredibly rude the entire time. He huffed and puffed and stomped his feet when I asked for the real Chinese menu instead of the Americanized Chinese menu. And, they used to throw shade if you asked for the Americanized menu, now it's the opposite. After we were done we both had a decent amount of food left and I decided to take it to feed to the raccoons that come around my house. They look cool and I like to feed them. Anyway, the take out container was dirty from previous food in it! I was blown away, especially when I pointed it out and the rude person pretending to be a man grabbed it out of my hand and stormed, literally stormed off before I was even half way through my sentence. I was calm the whole time, not sure what this guys deal is. Then came back with the same container that he washed! He washed the dirty container that should never have been used in the first place and thought that was acceptable. I will never go here again and I hope they go out of business so no one has to be punished by this Handy Nasty food. Disgusting food and disgusting people, except for the one guy who worked there who said goodbye to us. He seemed mortified because he knew what the cuck host just did to everyone in the dining area throughout the day and I assume throughout his life. I hate this place, and I can only hate it because I used to love it."", ""This is one of our favorite spots in Nashville.  It has recently been remodeled and looks great!  The patio can get loud, but other than that no complaints."", ""This is an updated review. I've been ordering from silver mine's at the same location for the last 4-5 years and they have only gotten progressively worse. Don't ask for anything to be added to your soup or chili; they'll charge you for the additions but will not include them in the order. They'll also most likely to include the free side such as the bread. It literally takes at least an hour to get your food delivered, maybe they should call Jimmy Johns and ask the what their secret is. This business is in major trouble with all of the other options available. The service is worse than if you had a bunch of kindergarteners running the business, at least they would be nice. You guys are right next to Eller Business School, why don't you ask them how you can improve??? Currently, this place is an embarrassment to their industry, and a waste of space on University Blvd. NEVER ORDERING FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN.""]",12
