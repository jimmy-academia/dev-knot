Films are usually shown in the original medium in which they were recorded. This makes for a much different experience than watching the films at home.   The theater is clean and the seating is stadium seating. They hold film festivals and show many rare and foreign films. I've been here multiple times where they have difficulty starting a film. I'm not sure if that is because of the medium or because they aren't prepared.   Anyway; I think Philadelphia is very lucky to have the International House and I suggest becoming a member for free films and special even invites. [REVIEW_2] This is my favorite sushi restaurant in Reno. My kids drive over from Chico.  This is a regular stop for the whole family. [REVIEW_3] Nice food but don't go to this place when their busy time; such as brunch time:))    After we ordered about half hour; our food still not show up and we ask the server that we waiting long time. You know what; our server told us ""you guys only waited 22 mins."" WHat the hell is that answer supposed to be???!!!!  And we ask separate check the guy said ""we dont do separate check when we are busy."" :)) Well... i dont offer tip when you busy then:)))) Who fking cares!! [REVIEW_4] If I could give zero stars I would. This is the worst store in this area. I bought a tree stand and was told I could return the product within 30 days if the stand did not fit our tree. Shortly after Christmas I came by to return a $9 tree stand as it did not fit. I was then told by their manager; Rosa; that their policy has always been all Christmas items are final sale. They wouldn't even consider store credit but just flat out refused to do anything. So; do not trust the person at the checkout counter and definitely avoid any Christmas items as you will not be allowed to return anything. Everything is final sale it seems. So; Kmart Goleta; consider me a permanent loss of a customer. I'd rather go to amazon. At least they understand customer service. [REVIEW_5] I've been here a handful of times and it's always because I don't have time to go to VN Nails near Costco where I prefer to go (they get 5 stars from me).  Kiwi Nail has always done a cheap job trying to take shortcuts wherever possible.  But today I've had it and will never go back!  After getting the typical shabby job on a fill with French tips;  I accidentally smudged two nails really badly.  They needed to be repainted and I asked her to do so... I even offered to pay extra.  The nail tech came over to look and she pressed the clumps back down and painted right back over the mess (didn't even keep the paint in the lines) then slathered so much varnish over the train wreck that it was literally dripping down my finger. After my nails were dry enough to leave;  another tech rang me up and the receipt had no place for a tip.  When I asked;  he told me I had to pay tips in cash... Well it's lucky for me I didn't have any cash.  He said I will have to tip her next time.  NEXT TIME??!!  yeah right!  There will be no next time! Save yourself the hassle and don't bother with this d@mn place! [REVIEW_6] I come here all the time on lunch breaks. Get the small chopped salad -- it is NOT small and tastes like heaven. Good cocktails too if I'm feeling like a flighty employee :) [REVIEW_7] It always has a strong smell when you open the door plus they aren't friendly or approachable at all.. .I will never go in there again [REVIEW_8] Definitely should have read the reviews first.   Ordered $100 worth of pizza for a 13 year Olds birthday.  Gave then 2 hours notice.  The pizza still showed up an hour late; cold and tasteless.  Absolutely awful.    Never again. [REVIEW_9] Wow. I am not a vegetarian; nor am I a health-food nut (except for my random ""diet"" binges) but this place is awesome. A co-worker talked me into trying it out one day (by going there and getting me something and putting it in front of me) and she created a monster. I may not order every day but I sure do think about them. And their delicious salads! Every time I go there I am greeted with a smile and there are tons of other people waiting for their food; as well. Good company =) [REVIEW_10] Been here twice now.  Both times I ordered a caesar salad with chicken; and both times it was a bust.  Some of the produce was wilted; browning and bitter; and just doused in dressing beyond anything reasonable.  Counter service was so-so.  First time I went in; there were two staff members taking their time.  I was third in line; and it took almost 20 minutes to walk out with my to-go order.  Second time I was in; there was literally no one behind the counter or anywhere in sight for almost 10 minutes.    No bueno; Fresh Bar.  Thanks anyway.",4
1,"[REVIEW_1] I had not patronized McDonald's in many years as there are many other establishments that actually seem to work for their customers business.   It took over five minutes before one of the four employees asked gruffly if I had been waited on. I placed an order for a #1 meal which is their Big Mac. As I waited for 14 minutes to get my meal several other customers approached the counter  complaining about their order accuracy. I watched as several people had to repeat this process three or more times before getting their order right or they gave up in frustration. No staff member including the English speaking manager/supervisor ever apologized or acknowledged the customers exasperation it gave the assistance if caring at all.   I figured with my long wait that I would at least get a hot fresh meal but apparently my food must have been praised long before my arrival. I received a cold Big Mac that was half unassembled in the box with my side of cold soft fries. Not sure why it took 20 minutes from the time I arrived at the counter until I received my order since the time was obviously not doesn't preparing my food and there were not many other customers in the store.   Lack of employee engagement; lack of empathy and poor or no management seemed to be the order of the day here. How on earth they can keep the doors open with every customer on site complaining and NO response or concern from staff is simply amazing. [REVIEW_2] This place is awesome! It's what a restaurant should be. Amazing food. Amazing prices. Very lively. Some people were on dates - other people having fun with their friends. Very casual. Friendly staff. It was a great environment & alllll about the food.   Got the cavatelli; the black & blue salad & the meatballs. The cavatelli and black & blue salad are outstanding.  That salad is out of this world and unique while still remaining a classic. The garlic oil they serve w the knots before dinner is also very unique and ridiculously awesome. I loved the Cavatelli so much that it's a shame bc I don't see myself ever wanting to order anything else. My friend had the lasagna which is huge and cheesy and awesome! I would probably definitely order that also. The portions are HUGE & the prices are low for what you're getting!! BYOB   Also the restaurant is great about substitutions. My friend asked for bolognase sauce on the lasagna which was a great addition. Do it.   The hostess is great also - ask her for recommendations she's very passionate about the food there and is really funny/nice.   . The meatballs are good but a little dry/too beefy. The sauce is good too but on the sweet side so it's something u have to be in the mood for. Probably wouldn't order again.    The tiramisu is good (good enough to order again/if you're in the mood!) but not the besttttt I've had. [REVIEW_3] If I could give negative stars I would. Terrible service. No one acknowledged me for over 10 minutes and that's only because I was leaving. The other customers told me don't bother ordering because I've been waiting over 30 minutes. [REVIEW_4] Horrible service. I had an appointment everything was on track; came back an hour and half later (during drop off they said it would be done) to find out they never even started my car. No phone call nothing. An hour and half after a scheduled oil change and your car was never touched. Safe to say they will never get my service. [REVIEW_5] First know that the shop works by appointment only.   Don't find out the hard way like I did.  Even though I arrived while Jack was there he told me both that he closes at 5 and works by appointment only.  I guess he has more customers than he needs.  I won't be one of them. [REVIEW_6] If you're not an overweight middle-aged white guy; or a 20-something female wearing a Hooter's uniform; don't bother looking for assistance at this location.  And if you do manage to corral a ""specialist""; or they deign to take a moment out of chatting with each other in clumps - clumps of overweight middle-aged white guys; that is -  you'll be lucky to get pointed in kind of the right direction. But be prepared to endure a lot of sighing and eye rolling before they do.  Update : after year or so of avoiding this place I stopped in today for some cabinet hardware. While I was shopping; the associate manager Kelly and another employee barged between me and the merchandise; talking amongst themselves. Neither of them bothered to look up; to say "" excuse me"" ; to offer to help; or even just say ""hey - how about getting the h*** out of our way"" . When confronted; rather than apologize; Kelly's first choice was to explain why whatever it was she was doing was more important than greeting or offering assistance to a customer. (She did eventually offer a snarky and clearly insincere apology.)   So it makes sense that the staff at this location behave like some customers are invisible. They're following the lead of the management. [REVIEW_7] What a disappointment. Not what most expect with jazz bar/dining establishment. Not dark or comfy seating. I got a mojito and I do not think they could spare the mint. They had a sign about a cover charge at 8. They came over and said if we were still there at 8 eating we would be charged. The food was nothing special. It was about equal with Zattarans box foods. The shrimp they served in the jambalaya and gumbo could not be smaller. Service was lacking. They may want to look at improving the food and entertainment to fill their very empty establishment before they focus on a cover charge. To add the music was not worth the five and was not really jazz bar type. The bar was also cheaply done. If they do not change they will be gone in six months.  Hmmm trying to find a positive kids menu was decently priced. [REVIEW_8] Had pulled pork with collard greens and sweet potatoe​  fries.  The pulled pork was tasteless and watery; the collard greens was hot. My wife sent her collard greens back and got onion rings;  which were ok. The sweet potatoes fries were ok as well. [REVIEW_9] I used Sultans last year and this year for moving and both times they were wonderful to work with! The first time I used them; they realized that my couch didn't fit through my door (after trying extensively) and they would not be able to hoist my couch up to my second floor unit due to an awning. They stored my couch for free and then came back a week later with a creative and innovative way to successfully get my couch through the window! They came back to move me out of the same unit this year; Tom remembered me and was super helpful in facilitating the move out. They were so friendly the whole time and truly made both of my moves easy! All of the movers both times were super friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend them for anything. [REVIEW_10] I've had some great Ethiopian food but this place was the worst ever; very disappointing and overpriced!  The service was very slow and the waitress spent most of the time chatting with her fellow employees and essentially ignoring us.    The menu was misleading - it lists a combo of ""all vegetables"" for $15; but really you just get 8 items of their choosing - the ""Queen's Eight"" platter.  Our waitress didn't even know this; until I questioned after she only brought us 6 items; and she had to ask someone else.  It seems unfair to charge the exact same price for a vegetarian platter as for one with meat dishes.    Every other place I've visited served the combo platter on a big piece of injera spread out on a large plate but here they serve a few (very small) portions of items on a couple of strips of injera.  Their injera was a disgrace!  As some other reviewers have noted; it was slightly dried out and the edges were crusty!  To top it off; the veggie items were maybe lukewarm; at best; and pretty bland for Ethiopian cuisine.    As we finished up our meal; I chose to eat a salvageable portion of the injera that had all the juices soaked into it.  Unfortunately hiding underneath it was a long black hair!  Needless to say; we won't be back!!!",2
2,"[REVIEW_1] I've been to this Chili's three times since moving to Reno a few months ago and I won't be back. Each time we've gone; we've waited to be seated with barely anyone in the restaurant and not acknowledged by the staff. When the hostess finally came up she was like a zombie and was half awake.  Our waitresses each time were different girls but both acted like they were irritated they had another table to serve. Very unfriendly and tried to rush us through the process. When we ordered we asked our waitress what the choices of sides were and she rolled her eyes and put a menu in front of us and said; ""they're listed in here"". So sorry to put you out! The chicken in my tacos was hard as a rock. When we were leaving; the hostess was at the door talking with a waitress about what they did on New Years and completely ignored us when we left. If your only job is to greet; seat; and open the door for customers; you should be fired because you couldn't handle one aspect of your job. Sorry; but if you're making your living off customers and tips; learn some customer service and get your attitude straight. [REVIEW_2] Quite disappointed - not in the chain; but certainly in this location. This is the third time in a row we've had problems with our meal. The last caused us not to come back for over a year - and we should have stayed away.  On this Sunday evening; the restaurant was busy; but not jammed. There were five in our party; and we continually had to remind our server about things we were missing before our meals even arrived - butter; silverware sets; refills on beverages...   I ordered a 13oz ribeye; rare; with only squash from the mixed vegetables. When it arrived 20 minutes later; the uneven piece of meat was medium rare on the thick end; and medium to well the rest of the cut - and I had a full serving of mixed vegetables with only one piece of squash. The manager took it to recook the order - and brought back a piece of meat so rare it was cold in the center and tough. I was hungry; so I chomped my way through.  Another steak was over-cooked; a third plate was missing sour cream and butter for a potato; cold shrimp on a fourth; and almost raw (crunchy) vegetables on the fifth.  The manager (Cody) apologized when he took my plate; but never checked back to see if my issue was resolved and for us to tell him about the other problems at the table. When the check arrived - full price. No offer of a dessert for the issues; nothing off the bill.  We will not be back. Jesse's is just a bit up the road; and the quality of both the food and the service are head and shoulders above this Outback.  One shout-out - Kate was great in helping to resolve issues; but she was tied up training someone else and we didn't see her again. [REVIEW_3] My husband and I went here right before they were closing because we were in the neighborhood and needed some items for a recipe we were planning to make the next day.  I was super disappointed in this food outlet.  The meat section looked AWFUL; most of the meat was turning brown and the whole back of the store smelled like rotten food.  Like I said; it was around closing time; but it totally turned me off and gave me a ""gut feeling"" that I shouldn't buy anything from this store.  The layout was also a bit unorganized.  I will not be back. [REVIEW_4] Do not stay here!    We had a very bad experience with this hotel.  Let me start by saying that we reserved a room for our wedding night.  The next morning we had a very early flight to Montego Bay so we checked out of our room around 5:30 a.m. the next morning.  We actually had no complaints until we tried to use our debit card on a large purchase in Jamaica on our honeymoon and it was denied.  OK; this special time that only happens once in your life.... was completely ruined because this hotel charged our account 3 TIMES for the room amount at a whopping $240 a pop. We only left a small amount in our checking account because we were travelling out of country (just in case something happened and someone got our card number or something).  After getting charged $19.99 per MB to check our bank account using data on my cell phone; we discovered this MESS that Courtyard put us in.    We had planned on a couple's massage by the beach in Jamaica but that couldn't happen!  Plans on our honeymoon were ruined and I am still very upset!!!  After getting back into the states on a Saturday evening; I called the hotel to try and figure out what as going on.  I was told that a manager would have to speak with me and she would not be in until Tuesday.  I was forwarded to her voicemail and left a message.  The manager finally got back with me and she stated that she had no idea what was going on.  I explained to her my process through booking: I am a Marriott Rewards Member so I just logged into my account and booked a room.  After realizing that I would not be about to check into the room at check in since our wedding was at 4pm I called the hotel and added my husband to the account so that he could check into the room.  I also asked about how much the deposit for the room would be since Marriott usually charges a deposit in case of any charges.  The lady told me that it varies per hotel and I told her that I needed to know (since we were only transferring a certain amount into our checking).  She called the hotel and then finally got back on the line with me... she said that the deposit would not be more than $50.  When he went to check in he told them he wasn't sure what name the reservation was under it could have been either one of our last names. They found the reservation and got him checked in.  We checked out at 5:30 a.m. the next morning and that was all we knew.  The manager had then figured out what had happened: They created a new reservation for my husband and then charged me for a NO SHOW on my reservation.  The third charge was the pre-authorization that showed $220!  Let me re-cap:  They charged me 2 TIMES FOR THE ROOM and screwed up the check in.  THEN... they neglected to let us know that the pre-authorization and the room cost would be charged in the same amount on the same day of check in!  They also charged us for parking!  We had already parked our car in a parking garage and did not park with them!   The manager acted as if it was my husbands fault for creating a new reservation.   I assured her that he absolutely knew that we had a reservation and wouldn't have created a new reservation that it must have been her staff that messed up!    She credited my account for the no-show; told me that the pre-authorization takes 7 business days to fall off of the account; and then credited me for the parking.  She did credit back all fraudulent charges to our account!  However; she can never replace what we lost on our honeymoon all because of their screw ups and neglect in informing us about the pre-authorization and room charge on the same day!  (Basically it showed up twice in one day right after another... which makes no sense... usually a pre-authorization is charged to hold the money and then the balance is updated... like when you leave a tip at a restaurant... not two separate charges!).  Ridiculous!! [REVIEW_5] Understaffed; with nonfunctional self service stations for car pickup. Unacceptable wait times to pick up a reserved car. Friendly staff; but painful to hear them making chit chat when you're waiting to get on the road. Better to go elsewhere at STL. [REVIEW_6] Dreadful place. Nice products; but not worth the constant glaring and staring. The staff seem to believe that every shopper is going to suddenly run off with a rack full of clothes. I have never felt as uncomfortable in any other store. Creepy. [REVIEW_7] Awful - long wait times; slow service; out of ingredients; and orders filled sloppily and incorrectly. Go down the street to the one on York Road near the mall. [REVIEW_8] Went for a round of golf Oct 14. First off; they were re-seeding; so it's understandable that the course was under 'duress'. The price was $29; you could not drive a cart off the path; the fairways looked great; obviously soaked in water for the over seeding; and the greens were effectively sand mats. To start they placed a single behind our party of 4 so we immediately had to let the individual behind us play through. All of this was fine until the sprinklers began pumping water into our round. Again; I know that they were over seeding; but we and many others were on the course when sprinklers kicked into full swing behind; ahead; and on top of us. Literally; we were surprise sprayed by popping sprinklers. Let's be clear here; I am not a professional greens keeper; and I do not claim to be an expert in watering of grass in a desert environment; but when people are playing through the course I feel it's fair that the sprinklers are monitored to allow their patrons to enjoy the experience. To finish this off; I am writing this review not because of the conditions; but because of the unacceptable courtesy of the two individuals in the proshop. After being unceremoniously assaulted by the surprise sprinkler attack; I went into the proshop commenting ""Hey; we were playing on the course and the sprinklers; not only prevented us from playing the round; they sprayed us"" (with what I assume to be reclaimed water; no fun). The more senior individual looked at me with an attitude and simply said ""Well that's over seeding; their going all day; we tried to warn you"" (while holding up the; carts on path only - reseeding sign). The whole experience was low; but these guys topped it off. I have zero interest in going back to this middle of nowhere course. [REVIEW_9] This location has made me late for work twice taking 35 minutes in the drive through. Gets simple orders wrong. For a chick fil a they deserve 0 stars [REVIEW_10] I went to Sabor del Caribe and had a totally awesome lunch today. I got the Pork Chunks and Beans and Rice and Salad and 2 Beef Empanadas. I am never disappointed when I go. The food is alway super top notch. You will also not find Empanadas nowhere this fabulous. For I have tried. They are alway loaded full of filling and the dip that comes with each one is the total bomb. I get the Fried Chicken as well and it is to die for. My lunch was under $10.00 today and I have enough for dinner tonight. If you have never been here then you do not know what you are missing and should get in you car and drive there. Hector's food has all the spice a great Latin Caribbean Restaurant should have and you expect and he is a top notch chef like Chef Hector. His food truck is always spotless inside and out and he and his wife could not be any nicer to all of their customers. Chef Hector I enjoy your food and I enjoy your hospitality. Thanks so much for the great food and keep up the great work.  People go see Sabor del Caribe you don't know what you are missing.",1
3,"[REVIEW_1] Not impressed at all. Sandwich bar was closed so I ordered a burrito. It was reheated in the microwave; cost 8 bucks; and nasty. Some sort of cream of chicken and old cheese on top. I'm amazed they can sell this and call it food. Could have had better at taco bell. [REVIEW_2] We attended a private party recently.  The appetizer; cheese ravioli; was good.  That is the only good thing I can say.  I had chicken parm and it was awful.....I actually got a piece of grizzle I had to remove from my mouth. And it was soggy. The red gravy was among the worst I have had EVER.  And the pasta was overcooked.  I could not eat it.  A friend who also attended had the same opinion and did not eat the entrée.  I have heard negative comments about Andreas for years now.  Unfortunately this was my first time eating there.  Needless to say; we won't go back.  They should shut the place down. [REVIEW_3] I love these guys. You couldn't ask for better customer service. My shoes needed more stretching after the first round; and they explained the process to me; stretched them again to perfection; and gave me some shoe spray for free! If you want expert service from helpful; welcoming people; this is the place. [REVIEW_4] 2nd visit. Tried all new items this visit and loved them all. Moroccan Chicken Piadina was delicious. Basil  Hummus was my fav. The icing on the cake is the lemon  cookies. Wow! Pro-tip: hummus is $3.99 at happy hour. [REVIEW_5] If I could leave negative stars then I absolutely would. I waited for a long time for my pizza in a relatively empty restaurant then walked up and was handed a BURNING HOT pie that I couldn't carry. Mind you I worked in food service for 6 years and I myself would never carry a pizza that temperature. After dropping a scalding pizzas I was called "" stupid"" and then given the impression they would remake my pizza. After waiting 20 minutes; I followed up with them. The assistant manager then told me it was all my fault and I'd be lucky if I got a couple pieces. End of story is worst custom service ever! [REVIEW_6] I have been going to Cyrano's for close to 30 years.  It has long been the place to take your date/spouse for a late night desert.  I have many great memories taking my girlfriend and later my wife for a intimate/romantic rendezvous as their staff perform their Cherries Jubilee tableside.  I have visited Cyrano's dozen's of time and have never had a bad experience.  The food is outstanding and their deserts are even better.  The wait staff always seems friendly and helpful.  Every time I go it always seems the place is extremely busy (a sign that they are doing something right after all these years).  But I have never felt rushed they have always made me feel like I am their only customer.  While I think they are known for their of the charts desserts; their regular menu is outstanding as well.  Just thinking about the coffee rubbed tenderloin makes me drool.  The Chicken Spiedini is another favorite.  If you want something quick and lite they have a variety of soups and sandwiches as well.   Did I mention the cocktails; well they are fabulous as well.  The Happy Hour Martini's are only $5.  I hope to go for another 30 years. [REVIEW_7] these people are great. through the years we've experienced everything and seen probably every doctor. these are true animal people; through and through; and you can always count on them for the best. not much else to say! [REVIEW_8] The hotel room service is terrible cause they skimp on shampoos; conditioners;body lotions;tissue and on the toilet paper .You would think they want to keep the customers happy;well they're very cheap on everything. My sheets and towels are often stained. I booked the hotel for the week; and spending the alot of money on my vacation this will never be the hotel I'll ever stay at.Thats a feed back toward better service for the future customers! [REVIEW_9] Good bagels; but they can NEVER get an order right.  We live in NJ so when you ask for Taylor Ham and cheese you think they would be able to handle this.    Instead I get a ham and cheese sandwich; or an egg; ham and cheese sandwich.  I am DONE with this place.  City Market or Lumberville General Store will be my two choices from here on out. [REVIEW_10] I was here on the soft opening day (11/18). The official opening is on 11/21. Drinks were buy one get one. They were handshaking all the drinks so it took a while. Our order was after a big group one so it took 30 minutes to get our two orders. They are still working things out so it's understandable.   The boba here are are very unique. They are clear and jelly like in texture with a hint of something fruity. It was a refreshing change. They appear to specialize in foam milk teas. I ordered a standard boba milk tea; which is the equivalent of ordering chicken tenders and fries at a restaurant. It was okay but the boba made it worth it. My sister ordered a boba Sakura oolong tea without the foam. She enjoyed it very much and will be coming back.   The decor of this place is super cute and I would rate it the cutest bubble tea in Chinatown. The owner is also very friendly and nice.",5
4,"[REVIEW_1] Amber tried to give us old fries and weren't having it. Cold and burnt; we are not the ones. Get it together. [REVIEW_2] Food was great. But very disappointed with the hospitality. We  entered the restaurant at 9:15 pm but was denied dine in and was told that though the  restaurant closes at 10 pm they won't let us dine in and can give only to go. They saw that there were two pregnant women and a kid with us and I explained that our home is a hour drive from there and yet they denied for no reason. I had to drive back to home and make everyone eat. Very disappointed with such attitude towards customers. Never going back here. Let them try to forgive them self for denying dining for pregnant women. [REVIEW_3] They take advantage of people who doesn't speak English and sign them up for a membership. They have ridiculous rules about cancelling membership but luckily for my father; he was from CA. I sent them a message via their website in December saying I have a copy of his license and I'd like to e-mail them to prove that he's not from the area and have his membership cancelled. No one bothered to reply back with an e-mail address nor physical mailing address since January was around the corner and they can rob my father of that extra month of membership fee. No wonder these thieves aren't successful as the two major gym we have nationwide. Sooner they get that through their thick skull and start having some decent customer service; sooner they'd be successful. Terrible experience. Don't use this place. You'll definitely get robbed. [REVIEW_4] If I could give a negative I would but that's yelps scoring problem  We went for Sunday brunch based upon a best of review in creative loafing. We were told a birthday party just came in so it would be 15 minutes but we could sit. So we did. For about 5 minutes and the waiter 1 came over and took our orders. Bacon and eggs and one of the salad combinations. Waiter 2 brought us a water and coffee after another 20 minutes and said our order was good. About 30 minutes later we got refills.  It was then i commented that the folks beside us to the left had arrived about 15 minutes ago and had just been served  Finally after 1 hour and 15 minutes we got served.  Then when the bill came we were charged $10 for an $8 item and $10 for a $6 item. That took about 10 minutes to correct.  All in all an absolutely MISERABLE experience.  Nothing would make me go back. First time I my life I left a zero tip.  The final nail was when I was trying to get the bill corrected waiter 1 was comping the other table for drinks because of the wait.  I wish I had read the other yelp sunday reviews before going there because they are absolutely correct.  Might I suggest closing for Sunday until you can do it right cause it's going to catch up [REVIEW_5] Very fresh food- they actually make their own stuff! We ate lunch at the bar and the bartender went out of his way to help my husband find a good gluten free option.   I ordered the black bean burger and it was delicious! Great atmosphere as well. Definitely recommend this place as there are not all that many fresh and relatively healthy places in the area. Wish we had found it sooner! [REVIEW_6] Food was very greasy;  service very bad; was seated at two tables  not cleaned or set. Will not return there. [REVIEW_7] Was once a great place to eat but I will not order from here again just got a stake and bacon sub all I found was raw fatty pieces of meat I'm guessing that was the bacon. Small pineapple and beef pizza well I really think the meat is old and no good because it was dry and the way the cheese was on the pizza it looked microwave. Being from the New York area originally this is NOT how they cook in ny. [REVIEW_8] I had not visited Perlis in over thirty years and I now remember why.   My mother used to bring me there when I was growing up. My relatives shopped there too ; it was THE place that all of the old well to do familys of New Orleans went.       As a child ; I never noticed the rudeness ; I guess because it was my mom who had to work with the attendants while I sat board.   At twenty three ; I had not yet purchased my own suits ; and was still wearing the ones my mother had bought for me in my early years.    As a Twenty two year old I was a little intimidated as I walked in and saw the well dressed ; sofisticated attendants . I remember receiving glares and a very rude ; sarcastic  "" may I help you  "" from what appeared to be the man in charge at the time.   The rest of the visit didn't get any better. The attendant had a rude arrogance about him ; as though he was doing me a favor even speaking to me .  He obviously did not remember me from the last ten years of business that my mother had given them ; or maybe he did and just didn't care .  I suppose that having established themselves as THE place to buy clothing ; they had developed an attitude of superiority ; but to what ; or who ? These guys sell clothes for gods sake ; who are they superior to ?      This attitude has NOT changed.     A month ago ; I decided to see if a quarter century had brought about anything positive in the way of attitude.  My treatment was no different from that of my visit in 1982.  One of my attendants ( the head guy that day)  ; had the same arrogance as I remembered from years past.  His desire was to put me in what HE thought was best and displayed a sneer at my taste ; ( wich is quite conservative in nature and right up their alley ).     I ended up getting three pairs of pants ; one of which needed to be left for tailoring. I was told that I would be called when they were ready.     Four weeks had gone by with no call ; so I called them.  The mans tone on the end of the line was one of a person insulted . It seems that I was the one in error for having waited that long before calling ; and my tardiness was the insult.  How dare I suggest that Perlis would not have the work done in a week!!!    "" We always do "" ; he said.  "" May I ask who your attendant was  "" ?   ""  I don't remember "" I replied .            Then  ; with a VERY sarcastic  "" we'll do you remember the color  ; sir "" ?  ; with the sarcastic emphasis on sir.    "" I really don't ; it was a moth ago  ; and I bought them purely on a whim "" ; I replied .     "" Well wait just a minute SIR and I'll go look"" .      It was then that ; wether by mistake or on purpose ;  I heard him say as the phone left his ear for the counter  ; "" STUPID IDIOT "" !!                It was 30 minutes later that went through the door of Perlis for the last time.   There to greet me with same snied. ; "" may I help you sir "" ;  was the man I had spoken with on the phone. In my minds eye ;  I was expecting to see someone like those who I had seen the month before ; someone about 45 ; dressed to the old New Orleans nines ; but to my surprise it was a much older fellow ; short in stature ; and wearing a suit that I can only describe as strangely old fashioned ; like something the duke of Windsor might have worn in 1968.  It's funny ; I remember a picture from my childhood of a chimpanzee in a plaid suit very similar to the one he was wearing.  The picture was a spoof of a used car salesman if I recall.      While handing me the trousers he said ; in his now standard ; and rather lyrical sarcastic tone ; "" come again SIR ""  .   Not wanting confrontation ; I muttered ; "" not likely "" as I left their store for good.       I really don't know where these guys get off acting this way!?  Is business so good that they can treat customers with such disrespect and still gain new customers over the years?  That just doesn't add up.  I am sure I can't be alone in my experience. I wonder how many hundreds of thousands of dollars thes strangely arrogant people have lost over the decades by insulting customers this way?      Old man Perlis had better take heed of the fact that anyone can get anything in his store over the internet ; and for less. [REVIEW_9] The worst... Food was cold and tasteless.  We thought we were eating week old leftovers.  When this place closes; I hope the guys from Zaynas will take it over so we can have a good place to go in this part of town. [REVIEW_10] Went to lunch at Tavern today 8/29/17 with three co-workers who had never been before on my recommendation. It was a huge mistake on my part. Tavern had been ok on previous visits but today a real disappointment. Slow and indifferent service. Hidden costs-charges for extra salsa on already over priced nachos. Ordered extra chicken on the nachos- it was not on the nachos when they arrived-we were still charged for them because Tavern brought us a plate of luke warm chicken to pour on after we'd already finished. We asked about the hidden cost of the chicken and salsa our server rolled her eyes and let us know she does not make the rules. This place is way overrated; over priced and the douche bag factor is off the charts. Fu*k Tavern.",1
5,"[REVIEW_1] Nice place! Good food and awesome service (Mike was our server and he was very nice & friendly!) [REVIEW_2] This place deserves 5 STARS.  It was such a great place to eat at a French style bakery; drink one of the best cups of coffee I've ever had and relax. I would highly recommend this little spot. Great choice. We'll be back! [REVIEW_3] Dmitri's is our family go to restaurant as we have been coming for the past 15 years. The food has been consistent - always fresh .. we never miss soft shell crab season with them.  The sautéed mussels are like no other - the hummus hands down best I've ever had. We frequent the best restaurants In Philadelphia - this is definitely one of our favorites. The restaurant has servers that have been there for years and that's just icing on the cake. We love Danielle - always a comfort  eating here.   Oh and don't forget the Greek coffee and rice pudding ! The best. [REVIEW_4] First and last time i ever go to this place! Kinda expensive...... Secondly there is no order in which racers get called! 2hr wait and people were just going way before my party. They do not give you a heads up of a any wait and when asked how much longer all they kept saying was ""ONE MORE"" every time; mind you 3 races after the ""one more"" if you ask me they have a bunch of untrained children running the place. Minimum wage at its finest!!!! [REVIEW_5] Fantastic food great environment to just shop; enjoy a gelato or sit down for some authentic Italian! They have ready made pasta and pesto. There's a different option for each day of the year! Love love love this place. Wish you would be open on Sunday [REVIEW_6] I am not sure they deserve one star..but they do not deserve two. Went this afternoon shortly after lunchtime. Walked in and was seated with my girl near the buffet. We discussed eating from it...but decided against it. I haven't been to a CM since the one left the Foothills mall many years ago....I never had any issue with anything at that location. The one on Campbell was not good. Server was polite; but when she came and gave us silverware...it was as if she was playing tiddlywinks...I was a bit perplexed when my three pieces were laid down knife....spoon over knife at a 45 degree angle; then the fork over top the same way...about 6 inches from my napkin. I hadn't thought about it until now...but I feel she was trying in code to tell me not to eat there. Yeah....that has to be it. I looked at the fork...and it looked as if it was taken from the table behind us....as they were using it....it was replaced with a clean one....I am hoping it was anyways...at least there was nothing on it that I could see...and that is 90% of the battle. On to the food. I ordered a chorizo burro. $9.00. This was the driest chorizo I have ever eaten....as my girth with attest.....I have had much chorizo in my life. About three hours after.....I feel yucky. Anyways.....I will not be returning here. [REVIEW_7] I grew up in the south and love Popeyes; by this one is horrible! It takes 10+ minutes to get your order. Last time we went; we got to the window and told us they were out of gravy :( and when we got home our food was cold (and not from the drive; we live less than a mile away). Sadly; we won't be returning. I wish this Popeyes was better. [REVIEW_8] We were planning to go to the Pancake Pantry and then Fidos for a Sunday brunch but both were very crowded.   Jackon's is located between the two.  They have great omelets..  I had the ASAP and loved it-never had an omelette like it.  They also have Conecuh  sausage which was a surprise because it is a South Alabama thing.   We love this place and the service!! [REVIEW_9] I knew what I was signing up for but first warning sign: cockroach in my bed. Then the fridge started leaking water everywhere until it just died. THEN after calling the front desk to extend our checkout time; some rude hood lady came banging on the door saying she was gonna call the cops. I would've been fine if they charged us an extra day. Customer service is not their strong point. But it makes sense since all they deal with are crackheads here. ""Under new management""? You need NEWER management. [REVIEW_10] We had such a great meal at Spiro's tonight! Neither my dining companion; nor myself had been there previously. We both had a Greek salad; which was prepared table side. I had the Dolmades; and my coworker; the combo plate which had moussaka and dolmas and lamb (which he could not stop raving about). To our surprise our server brought dessert on the house; since we had never dined there before; it was such a nice touch! Ben our server was fantastic and knowledgable. We are both in the industry so we felt guilty about staying until the restaurant closed; but we were just so comfortable and well fed that we lost track of time. Spiro's is very close to my house; it will definitely be my new regular spot. Thank you Ben; and the whole Spiro's crew; for a great time to compliment a rare night off! You rock!",6
6,"[REVIEW_1] If you want to pay for everything a la carte this is the place for you.   Food wasn't terrible not impressive. They brought a basket of chips and some tomato sauce which I asked politely for something spicier and some pico de gallo.  She brought them happily to me and the salsa was much better.  When asked what we would like to drink I asked for a coke and she brought out a bottle which I stated I wanted the fountain drink.  She said ""oh that's only Pepsi"".  Never mentioned that they only had bottle drinks for coke.   We ordered our food which was reasonably priced; asked for sour cream and also to put cheese on the taco.  She let us know cheese was extra.   It was $2.50 extra for another basket of chips.   When I received the bill we paid more for the condiments then the actual food.  Side of sour cream 2.00; pico de gallo 2.50; salsa 2.00; chips 2.50; cheese 1.00 and the bottled coke that we didn't want 5.00.   Just a suggestion...when you order anything make sure to ask if there is an extra charge. [REVIEW_2] This location has made me late for work twice taking 35 minutes in the drive through. Gets simple orders wrong. For a chick fil a they deserve 0 stars [REVIEW_3] I'm not sure why I'm writing this since you can just look at every other review written for this place and get the exact same story.   My wife was literally grabbed; like actually literally grabbed; by the face the second she stepped in the door. The culprit was a big-tittied shot girl that proceeded to dump a bunch of piss water down her throat. Then I was informed I owed her $24. When I refused to pay I was told the police were being called. My wife; not wanting to spend our trip coming to pick me up at the police station; (which is where I gladly would have gone rather than give a penny to these shady-ass MFers); swiped my wallet from my pocket and paid the bill.   Everybody there from the door guys to the managers to the bathroom attendants are the worst; most sketchy people on Bourbon Street. If you gave this place a five-star review please do humanity a favor and shoot yourself in the face. [REVIEW_4] Very unhappy with the treatment we received today. After eating a Sushi Rose since it opened up; and their parent restaurant Asian Wok next door; we have never had a sushi chief be so rude and inhospitable. Flower was the acting manager today. She almost permanently lost our business had it not been for the kind service of the waitress. [REVIEW_5] Delicious food; quick; efficient and great service. The owner is really nice and always helpful. A must try. [REVIEW_6] These guys are the best; I've been putting off this filling for about 5 years and it finally gave in; these guys got me in the same day were quite affordable seeing as I do not have insurance; the staff was lovely as was the dentist; quick and good work. I couldn't thank them enough. [REVIEW_7] I have been going to this nail salon for years off and on. I came here back when it was called Tropical Nails and Tom was the owner. Now its Grant Nails and has a different owner. When I started getting my nails done again I lucked out and found an experienced technician named Amy. I stuck with her because she did good nails. Then about 2 months ago Amy left. So I let the owner Angela do my nails. The first time was ok. Then the second time she did them the gel polish (which she talked me into getting instead of regular polish) started to chip within a day. I called and complained; she redid the polish and again within one or two days it was chipping. Now my nails look at mess. I don't trust her to correct the problem. Unfortunately; I'm going to have to find a new nail place. Very upsetting and disappointing. [REVIEW_8] I have lived in 3 majors cities across the US; 2 foreign countries; and although I have only been to PP twice; it is hands down the best pancake I have ever had. Sorry; Mom.  And you don't even have to get the crazy Sweet Potato or Buckwheat stylings to get something special. Just get regular old Buttermilk; they are perfect. They are the pancake ideal.  I was here for the first time about 5 years ago. It was amazing. I just went back for the second time; the memory of my first visit in my mind; and I was just praying it was as good as I'd remembered. It was. [REVIEW_9] Gaetano's used to be one of the better spots in the area (not saying much) to grab a good quick lunch. I'd stop in here roughly once a week to grab a sandwich off of their lunch special menu that rotated daily.  Well they completely ruined that. Gone is the rotating; reasonably priced lunch menu. They've since replaced it with a menu that isn't even worth ordering off of. They regularly had specials of sandwiches; wraps; and salads on the lunch menu for under $7 that came with chips/fries and a drink. All but one item on the menu includes a drink now and I just paid $9.01 for a buffalo chicken wrap; tiny bag of chips; and soda I had to buy separately. Whoever made it must have missed the memo on how to assemble it because it didn't have the crisp lettuce and tomato inside of mine that was stated on the menu. I got a $9 wheat wrap stuffed with a pathetic amount of chicken and nothing else. It was smaller than the premade Wawa wraps. Huge change in what Gaetano's used to be; their portion sizes were always their strong point.  I posted a picture a while ago of a meatball sandwich lunch special I got before they started cheaping out on their offerings. I wish I took a picture of my pathetic wrap today; they couldn't look more different. I didn't have time however because it took about 12 minutes to come out and some of us don't have all day.  I'll be looking elsewhere during my lunch break. [REVIEW_10] The girls behind the counter are so delightful and nice. Treat you nicer than your family! Help you get what you like! I also got a grilled cheese. It's nice to try the local delights.   Stevie Nicks playing overhead.   My grilled cheese is a work of art. I'm already excited af. The cheese was real not velveeta. Very very beautiful and comforting. It came with sea salted potato chips.  The ice tea was made fresh. The taste is refreshing & exceedingly delish.   Free WiFi too... so you can Yelp!",4
7,"[REVIEW_1] This place might be small and tucked into a small strip mall; but it's got great customer service and food so far. The guy that has always been working there is always nice about answering questions regarding the cuisine here. My husband knew he loved Vietnamese food; I however assume it would be full of fish based dishes or stuff a picky water wouldn't like. I could not have been more wrong! oh how I love the pho soup here with beef. I like that with the mint and hot sauce so that I can taylor my flavor. The sweetened iced coffee is yummy and so are  the fried bananas! My mom and my husband love those fresh spring rolls. They smelled amazing! But I don't eat cold food; so that is only second hand! But she said they were the best she's eaten in Indiana ever! We finally got to try one of the dumplings that are normally special order only; it was so savory and tasty! If you are ever there and see them; try them! If you aren't sure you will like something ask what is in it! They are more than helpful. [REVIEW_2] We actually come here often for different products; however this place needs a lot of work or different management. The management hides in the little office and never comes out to help regardless of people needing help. They need several more employees and I've sent several of my students from UNR needing part time orfull time but the hiring process is so crazy nobody's interested! Lastly most bathrooms at the gas stations are cleaner than this bathroom. It's crazy filthy. And this is supposed to be kind of a professional place. We've been coming here for a long time and these observations are over a period of consistent observation. I just finally decided to write a review. I think we will switch to the mud town location. [REVIEW_3] I love food trucks that bring something different to the table. And the ""Twisted Iron"" brings it!!! I order the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger Waffle Burger with a side of waffle fries and i must say it was well worth it!!! The burger was cooked to perfection and the fries were nice and crispy. I cant wait to come back and try there chicken and waffles. [REVIEW_4] This grovstyles is very unprofessional and took forever for my order to come in and never do I shop there again [REVIEW_5] I love takoyaki (octopus balls) and okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake) and almost always jump at the chance to order these when I can.  Sadly; Maru Global doesn't know how to make either.    I came here for dinner a while back and when I left; the remains of a half-eaten okonomiyaki lay on the table.  I am a beastly pig; and this for me; is kind of unheard of.  They aren't terribly well staffed here (at least when I came with a group of about 7); so if you order all at once in a large group; it takes quite a while for people to get to eat.    But on the food side; I ordered an okonomiyaki; and what I got was a pancake with a grainy; doughy texture; that was incredibly oversalted.  The consistency of the takoyaki was similarly off although I can't put my finger on what exactly was wrong.  Anyway; suffice it to say that I've had plenty of great octopus balls and Japanese pancakes elsewhere (like in New York; you can find this in the East Village in the form of Yakitori Taisho or; my fav; Otafuku; or in Philly there's Yakitori Boy).  This place just doesn't cut it; and I'm certain I won't be coming back. [REVIEW_6] This is the worst restaurant that I have ever been to. Service is poor. Food is soso. We have to go to another restaurant afterwards to get some real food. I will never come again. I would not recommend it to any of my friends. [REVIEW_7] If you can't come to work with pride and energy and enthusiasm then don't work at a McDonald's where people are in a hurry to get somewhere else.....so disappointed in the behavior of humans! [REVIEW_8] This review incident dates back to 2009 but I still truly feel ""hot under the collar"" about my used car experience with Sherwood Kia.  I bought a 2002 Sunfire; cash; off the lot. The salesman was pushy; rude; and very ignorant. Upon the test drive the car was was hesitating as I was shifting gears and he said that they would look at the problem before I left the lot if I bought the car. I paid $3000 for it and needless to say....what a piece of *%#@! Everything that was checked off their ""maintenance report"" saying was in good condition had to be replaced within the first week I had the car as I took it to a reputable mechanic.  SO....7 days; I asked for my money back!!! I got the run around so bad that I eventually wrote a letter to the owner (AFTER NO ONE WAS RETURNING MY CALLS) and the Used Car dept. manager (whoever) called me after another 2 weeks and asked me to come in. I went in there asked for the manager and then I stood in the dealership for 30-minutes before he came up to me. Well....we got into a yelling match in the parking lot after I was in tears and yelling inside and threatened to call the BBB; tell everyone of FB; and whoever else would listen that...get this...(his exact words)...""We DO NOT guarantee quality used vehicles""!!!! I'm not kidding! I never got my money back and I REFUSE to ever do business there again!!!! [REVIEW_9] I went to Fez with my family and we were pretty excited to eat some good Moroccon food! However; it was a horrible experience. 1) food was below average. 2) overpriced for very small portions 3) slow service 4) I was surprised for the price they didn't even serve  free pita/ appetizer or Moroccan tea/coffee     The only good thing was the ambience and that's it!  Wouldn't recommend it and wouldn't go back! [REVIEW_10] The restaurant is beautiful and food is amazing.  I purchased red snapper bento box and it is a generous portion. Staff is very friendly.",3
8,"[REVIEW_1] I had one of the top three worst restaurant experiences of my life here. One example is that my wife got a lukewarm burrito and sent it back after talking with the manager. The burrito came back partly eaten....by the chef....as the manager said she has the chef taste things when complained about....AND SHE BROUGHT THIS BURRITO BACK TO OUR TABLE...THE MANAGER  (who said she is part of the founding family). This is after waiting more than 90 minutes for our food. On top of that; the food is mediocre at best. Now I've read El Charro is selling burritos at 7-Eleven stores in California....enough said. Do yourself a favor and go to Poco and Mom's or even Guadalajara Grill. El Charro is WAY past its expiration date and those running it now no longer know how to serve excellent; or even decent; Mexican food. [REVIEW_2] I'm so disappoited after coming to her a couple time. I just got my hair cut and she thinned out my hair wayyyy too much. I'm so upset cuz i've been telling her not to cut my hair too thin and short. i lost all my pretty hair that i had been kept it long for years and years. but she did. I would never be back there.... [REVIEW_3] Mark; the owner is almost always on site and is extremely helpful without falling in to  the pushy category. I'm a man that has a difficult time putting things together to make an outfit and Mark will pull a number of pants; jeans; shirts; belts; shoes; ties; sweaters; hats and even a cool scarf and tell you what works together to really ""make an outfit"". Prices are reasonable in that he often has a promotion going and I'm happy to pay for great service. 5 stars. [REVIEW_4] Fantastic. We did carry out; tried a few different tacos; the tostada; and bean dip appetizer. Everything was delicious; fresh and interesting flavor combinations. Favorites were the tostada; poblano taco; and the el cochinita. Definitely a different flavor and vibe than traditional Americanized Mexican restaurants. Can't wait to go back. [REVIEW_5] The oysters are amazing and especially the warm chocolate mouse dessert! [REVIEW_6] Another massage therapist referred me to her;  and I'm so glad that she did! As a service provider myself; i have a lot of tension and muscle challenges.  Her massage was one of the most relaxing and effective massages I've ever had!  (Thing I loved the most:  she used hot rice bags to relax the muscles of my neck and back while  she massaged other areas) [REVIEW_7] This place is terrible.  I should have gotten a clue based on the fact that I went there with a group of 8 people on a Saturday night and there were NO other customers in the restaurant. Needless to say; I ignored the signs and ate here.  This was literally the worst Thai food I have had in my entire life.    First; I ordered the tom yum soup.  They asked me how spicy I wanted it and I responded that I wanted it spicy.  I did not expect that the entire bowl of soup would be covered in red pepper flakes.  Disgusting. I spent ten minutes picking red pepper flakes out of the soup and my mouth.      I also tried the chicken satay.  The chicken was ice cold and as dry as beef jerky. The dipping sauce was a mix between curry and Planter's honey roasted peanuts.  It was a bizarre combination like nothing I've ever had before.  Once again...Disgusting.     Finally; I ordered curry.  I had high hopes that they could not screw up everything in my order.  Boy was I wrong.  The curry was bland and just plain gross.   Overall; all 8 of the people in my group left the restaurant dissatisfied. My recommendation is that you walk two blocks down the road and eat at the Blue Elephant Thai Restaurant. [REVIEW_8] Friday I got Shrimp Curry as takeout.  Got sick; sick; sick all weekend.  Sunday went to the clinic and was told I had food poisoning. [REVIEW_9] As 45 put it best...  this place is a ****hole.   To the people in charge of the entire brand Steak and Shake:  take note of how Freddy's operates. Ditch the worthless waiters who understandably are as motivated to return to the table as I am the proctologist..   it's flipping 3.99 meals and half the customers are kids. Of course you won't make crap for tips.   Put up a coke freestyle machine and have people place and order up front. I'll get my own refills and napkins. Faster mind you and with pleasure.   PS.  It's not normal to had a 4 year old a fully loaded plate of food. [REVIEW_10] I love this little place.  It's a dive bar full of great staff and customers around the bar.  The menu includes several vegetarian items; as do the daily specials.  The soups are fantastic.  Did I mention that Flanagan's is open 24 hours?  Plus!",5
9,"[REVIEW_1] I've had Amanda cut my boys' hair for years. She's awesome! [REVIEW_2] There are MANY positives about Brixx. Here are just a few: 1 - Excellent food!  Pizzas are inventive for the non-traditionalist and great for the traditionalist. Excellent wood fire without the wood burn!  Same for the salads and sandwiches. Just delicious.  2 - Solid prices. Try the lunch special of 1/2 pizza and 1/2 salad for only $7.95. It served as two satisfying meals for me. 3 - Absolutely delightful staff - attentive; helpful; kind (can't say enough) 4 - Great interior and exterior - thought went into the layout and decor.  I could continue; but I suggest you try it out yourself. Brixx is an excellent addition to Fishers!!! [REVIEW_3] The person next door reported a leak coming from my condo to hers.  I didn't see how this could be.  I checked everything; noticed a small amount of water in floor by bathtub which I assumed spilled from showering; i.e.; curtain not pulled tight.  However; I called Tom She'll plumbing to see if there was an actual leak.  They arrived at appointed time; I discussed the issue with them; they checked everything thoroughly; and discovered a small leak at the commode which in time would flow toward the bathtub.  They replaced the flapper and internal parts and made sure there was no leak.  Dan said that there would be no charge until it was sure that repair solved the leak issue.  This water somehow traveled at least 8 feet to cause an issue next door.  After several days; the person next door said the issue was solved.  Good work guys! [REVIEW_4] This is sushi for philistines; all sauce and fried things. The spicy tuna is so spicy you won't taste the tuna at all. Flavorful and heavy; like pub food. We got nigiri as a palette cleanser; I don't think there was any vinegar in the rice at all (which is what sushi means). It was good; but not what I expected. Like when you invite a couple friends over for a quiet kickback and it turns into a rager. Fun in an overestimating kind of way. [REVIEW_5] I can not believe on how unprofessional we were treated today by you shift manager Ashley at the original location. Food was ordered for a couple of girls in our office and when dealing with Ashley the young lady from our office got into a long drawn out convo with her and they had words.  I was not the one on the phone call; so I did not think I was going to be treated poorly; but I was.  I don\'t understand why Ashley would not give us her first name unless she was concerned about something. By her doing so; it made myself and a co worker that came in with me feel as if something was probably done to our food. The guys in the kitchen were watching us curiously; trying to hold back from laughing as if maybe they spit in the food.  I called the owner David to discuss all of this and he did not take the call or call me back [REVIEW_6] So it's 6:30 pm and all flights at the airport are delayed due to weather. This pizza place is right in the middle of the terminal so it's a good place to grab a bite. Here's the problem. They have no food! I ordered a salad and was told ""we are all out of salads""; then I ordered a slice of margarita pizza and was told that all that is available is pepperoni or cheese. The lady behind me wanted garlic knots; they were out. The place was empty at first so it's not like they sold out. They just didn't stock well. They have one kid working there and he makes one pizza at a time. Don't have a menu up if only 2 of the 11 items are offered! The pizza was fine but it was really a strange experience. [REVIEW_7] We stayed here for a long weekend last year. 2 kids; 1 a toddler and we had a great time. All the restaurants were good. My son and husband had fun at the arcade. Hubs enjoyed gambling. My favorite hotel in Reno. [REVIEW_8] Literally spent 2hrs+ making sure each curl is strategically placed  constantly asking how I like it so far and if I need any water; coffee; wine etc  and I was seriously shocked when I saw the price as it was way lower then I had expected; considering the princess treatment I had received. Thank you again. Hubby also approved [REVIEW_9] The deep dish pizza here is fantastic!! Like some other reviewers have mentioned; Pi is no Lou Malnati's or Giordano's. To start; we ordered the Billy Goat Chips and French Onion Dip. The chips were great; but the dip was way too salty. I'm not sure if the dip was supposed to be that salty or if maybe the chips' seasonings brought out more saltiness; but my taste receptors were screaming. But then it was time for the main attraction of the night: our large 1/2 Bucktown and 1/2 South Side Classico. At first I thought a large would be too much food; but between my boyfriend and me; we really only ended up with three pieces of leftover (pizza for breakfast is unparalleled; am i right?). The cornmeal crust was perfectly crunchy and flavorful. The toppings of each specialty pizza complemented each other well. The tomato sauce was a bit on the tart side and fairly overpowering but delicious all the same. The restaurant itself has loads of seating and the ambiance is nice. I would highly recommend Pi if you're in St. Louis and have a hankering for deep dish. [REVIEW_10] Try the bouquet tea tonics-  they're delicious! The mochas are also very yummy and the artwork on top of the mocha is cool! The lavender latte was awesome too! If you're in Reno; don't miss it!",8
10,"[REVIEW_1] The only thing I love more than their coffee are the baristas that work here. It's a quiet; good place to read a book and enjoy a multitude of drinks they offer. [REVIEW_2] Farmhaus is another great restaurant in St. Louis.  My bf and I went for lunch.  It was excellent food with a great price.  Next time we are in St. Louis we will go there for dinner. [REVIEW_3] The waitstaff were attentive and very nice! That is the only positive comment that I have for this establishment: I waited fir over an hour while moderate celebrities were ushered in. After all of the waiting the food was not good. Grits were hard and not seasoned; shrimp & fish over cooked; it was a disappointment. [REVIEW_4] Good breakfast...not all your traditional meals; but fresh and delicious. I love The Nest; sub with scrambled eggs.  Ask for jelly after you eat the eggs out of the biscuit; they make their own. Staff is friendly and quick.  Several pastry/baked options at the register.  Yum.  Fresh coffee and lattes [REVIEW_5] Food 5/5 Service 5/5 Atmosphere 5/5  Came for lunch buffet.   Tandoori chicken : flavorful; juicy (not dry from the headlamps); chicken Tikka : delicious; chili chicken  and curry chicken : both very good.  Kheer (Indian rice pudding) : tastes yummy  Naan : fresh; soft; and stayed soft throughout meal.   Service : one lady doing so much.  I didn't have to ask for water refill; she was already there. Didn't have to ask for plate to be removed; she already did it. Hard working.   Atmosphere : relaxed; has music and TV that shows how they cook. And cartoons for kids too. [REVIEW_6] It was very good!  All the meats (particular the ribs) were very flavorful: great seasoning; smoke; and char/caramelized sauce.   I really dug the beans because they had a lot of zing to them.  We got the feast and it was a good variety.  My friend got the chicken tenders; and they were just alright.  But; I don't go to a BBQ place for tenders.  I love BBQ; and I'll go back to Famous Dave's. [REVIEW_7] I ate at the Denny at the corner of oracle and river rd in Tucson; I ordered some grits and side order of sausage; and 3 eggs; that was the Nastiest meal I have ever had; that's a shame because the people that worked there was kind and helpful; but the food was terrible; the grits was dry and hard and not done; the sausage tasted like meatless sausage and boiled; the eggs tasted like they had been cooked hours ago. The 1 Star is for the kind people that waited on me. [REVIEW_8] I kind of don't understand the place to be honest. It's like a mix of a place where you can drink beer all night; have breakfast in or drink hot tea in the afternoon. Whatever it is; it's got pretty great stuff!!! They have some beer flavors off the tap that I've never heard of before like ""Strawberry Shortcake Lager"" (which was what I tried). It was good; smelled like strawberries but tasted nothing like them. I also had a taste of their pear cider (which you can also get off tap) and the flavor mixed with the fizz was actually really good. Not the kind where it sort of hurts your throat. And with the ciders you won't feel the alcohol so much too so you wouldn't really know if you're starting to get tipsy or not. We had some food along with the beers too; we tried their pretzels with beer cheese dip. The pretzels were freshly made and the dip was exquisite!!!!! Really good salty side to pair for a great night with beers and conversations! [REVIEW_9] No; it doesn't exactly fit into the Hill; with its Spanish flair and sexy design; but somehow it works. The location is perfect; the building elegant and the interior perfectly subdued and romantic.   The sangria is lovely and the selection of tapas is good. I always go for the shrimp. It varies in terms of what it's marinated in or served with; but it's always been good.  I also NEVER go without ordering the Plato de Quesos - a plate of Spanish cheeses with walnuts; honey and grapes. [REVIEW_10] I love this place; too bad I only go about 4 times a year.  Its more of treat for me.  Quality food & service and would expect nothing less based on the price.",8
11,"[REVIEW_1] The ambiance and live music here is fantastic. The band was pleasant and not overbearingly loud.  However the whole ""you have to be out in 1.5 hours"" is a major turn off. I could understand if people were sitting around not ordering but if you're ordering food and drink that makes no sense.  The food was decent but nothing to write home about. The service however was terrible. Since everything is served tapas style the food comes out as it's ready. Unfortunately my tacos took so long that everyone was finished eating and I still didn't have my food.   Then I saw the table next to me (which arrived 30 min after us) served not one but two taco plates. When I asked the server what's going on; she gave me a really bitchy attitude and acted as though she was talking to a child. She goes ""yeah like I said the kitchen is backed up."" To which I said yes but not enough She did take them off the bill but her attitude was so off putting and condescending I didn't even care at that point.   The tacos still took another 15 min after that.   Also they have 2 different websites with different menus which is confusing. I went there based on one menu and got something different. Annoying. [REVIEW_2] I should have never waited this long to visit Delicia as I live right down the street! This is ideal for a girls night or date night.  Atmosphere: As many people mention; the outside of the building does not do this place justice. The decor inside reminds me of a casual place you'd find in Los Angeles... I easily forgot I was in SoBro while dining here!  Drinks: I went with my server's recommendation of the house margarita and it took first place (Sorry; Bakersfield!) for best marg in the city. It was fresh and the presence of tequila was just strong enough.  Food: We started off with the queso fundido con chorizo; which was perfect to share. I thought this was a delicious ""grown-up"" queso that I would order again. A girlfriend and I split the Tamal Corn Cakes for our entree and it was the perfect amount of food after our app. The barbacoa was so tender and savory and complimented the sweet corn cake perfectly. The herb green rice was also very good.  Overall: Go here! My only regret is being too full for dessert. [REVIEW_3] Guy at the counter was rude; the place was filthy; and all around horrible! Would/will not recommend this place at all! [REVIEW_4] So I'm quite certain I will never be returning to this restaurant. Upon walking in the manager greets us and asks where we were from. A friend of mine; and the only one amongst us from Louisiana; responded. The manager came back with a comment about my friend being from a trailer park when he heard where he was from (he's never lived in a trailer). So immediately not a good impression.  We get seated; the manager tells us our server is going to be male; a female shows up. Clearly bad communication. The waitress greets us and asks how we're doing and I return the question. She responds that she has been better. I'm a server and I know from experience; even if you're having a bad day; you don't show it or just come right out and say it.  The waitress suggests homemade hurricanes to drink. Two of the people in my party decide to try one. They were horrible. They were so potent u could hardly drink them. They definitely needed to add a little juice. Some cornbread with a honey sauce came to the table. It was very good! As an appetizer; the 4 of us split a sampler platter.... Which took 25 minutes to hit the table. The shrimp were good. The catfish was plain. The salmon patties were just OK. The red beans were pretty good. The turnip greens were very bitter. Overall not impressed.  For our entrees: One friend got the rib eye; it was undercooked. His wife got a blackened fish. The only reason the fish was ""blackened"" was because it was burnt. My fiancé got the jambalaya and catfish plate. The jambalaya was decent but the catfish was again plain. I had the shrimp scampi. It was pretty much the only positive thing about the whole meal besides the cornbread. Oh and did I mention it took 45 minutes after we finished our appetizer for the entrees to get there... [REVIEW_5] SRS is truly an exceptional management company. They have been extremely accommodating with very specific requests that I have made. Recommend. [REVIEW_6] I love kimpton hotels. My husband took me here for my birthday and it was grand. We stayed in the majestic suite on the 10th floor. We had views of Independence Hall and the Constitution Center. The room was beautiful; very chic. My favorite part was the bathroom with the huge soaking tub. Definirely recommend this hotel. [REVIEW_7] My husband and I came to this Bully's to watch the Nevada Wolfpack vs. Texas Tech football game on September 24th and before the 3rd quarter was over the bar replaced almost every TV with UFC. I understand the bar paid for the pay-per-view; but if they had mentioned this to us we would have sat at a location with a television bigger than the piece of crap tiny TV we are now in front of; and that was in HD; or we would have gone to a different sports bar. Plus for the second time in a row the service was horrendous.  You just lost a customer Bully's. Congratulations. [REVIEW_8] If I could give it a zero; I would. I order a plain hamburger; and realized they put  bacon in it (which I am allergic to and unable to eat) after two bites. When I went back to the drive-through window to complain (didn't realize the actual restaurant was open--it was almost 2 after all...); the guy took back the burger; said nothing; and disappeared. After 2 minutes of awkwardly making conversation with the next people in line in their car; he came back and rudely told me I had to go inside to get my food. Which I did. And still did not get an apology.  I refuse to go back there after that ordeal; which is a shame; because it's nice to have a variety of places to go to after DT. Guess Freebirds it is! [REVIEW_9] Will not return. Have given this location numerous second chances for improved customer service; but have observed no positive changes. Their drive thru service is terrible; both in terms of employee attitude and communication skills as well as their seriously lacking audio technology. This location is a complete disappointment and in need of a serious management overhaul. [REVIEW_10] 3 calls to say when they'd come never happened. Our ""Guaranteed morning appointment"" became ""we'll try to get there in the morning"". Nobody can reach the installers; no management is available on the weekends; ""printing problems have delayed the ability to call customers back"" (actual quote); being told to wait 10 hours on a Saturday isn't convenient; something they touted in their sales process. Salesman **Name Redacted** thank you for ""not being able to do anything"" but being happy to sell the carpet.  (message me if you'd like the salesman's name)  Morning appointment; its 2:21PM currently; no carpet.",3
12,"[REVIEW_1] We are choice rewards members and this by far is the worst property that we have ever stayed at and we travel a lot.  I wasted my reward points staying there because their pictures of the property were so deceiving. There was mold all over the bathroom light and ceiling.  Chunks of drywall missing from the walls.  The bathroom smelled like urine.  Their were people smoking;  screaming and running down the halls way after 10 pm and then back at it at 7am. We were told that we were lucky to get the room we got because they were booked up but the parking lot was half empty. Very disappointed and a waste of points. [REVIEW_2] Pretty darn good.  Great service; food was good.  It was a great change from Noshville; where we ate the morning before.  There was a short wait; but we beat the Sunday crowd and the service was friendly and swift.  The breakfast was very good.  Blueberry pancakes for my friend; eggs and cheese grits for me...with one silver dollar pancake just so I could taste what they're known for.  Will definitely return if I have the opportunity. Someone at a nearby table spilled a glass of milk.  No problem.  Servers were there in an instant to clean up; all with good nature. [REVIEW_3] Terrible service! I just stood downstairs at the front desk waiting for a Starbucks coffee for over 15 minutes while the front desk clerk attended to another couple.. that's not the problem. Not once did he turn around and acknowledge me (he knew I was waiting) it was so long that THE COUPLE said ""We're taking to much of your time and you can go ahead and attend to that lady"".. but nope; still didn't turn around and say anything or attend to me. I ended up walking away. Glad we're checking out. The air conditioner kept us up all night long clicking on and off; it's extremely loud and their pool is closed for the season. Bye! [REVIEW_4] I had a bike fit last week at Swim; Bike Run and am shocked at how much better my ride is! It is night and day; and much more reasonably priced than the location where I purchased my bike.  The staff is helpful; which is especially important to newbies like myself.  Keep up the good work. [REVIEW_5] I'm the second extremely low review but it seems the other does not show up on Yelp because it isn't ""recommended"".  We rated low for the same reason; which I think is notable. The visits I had here with Dr Burli and her staff were maddening to say the least.   I was told I did not have an infection that I only found out I DID have by calling 5 days later; 3 times in only 2 weeks I was told I would get calls back that were never returned. Dr Burli started lecturing me for medications that my primary doctor gave me she felt I should not use which I never asked for that advice(diet; as if my gynecologist was suited to speak to that).  I wish she would have focused better on the gynecological diagnosis I was there for and not distracted herself with my diet!   One female resident medical student was fine but the other male had wrinkly clothes and looked like he hadn't shaved in a week or so before he assisted while I was being examined (gross).    She tried to explain to me my symptoms were the result of a condition that could not be treated and that I needed to live with it. I insisted we do more tests because her explanation stated that the cause started nearly a year after the symptoms (which made no sense at all). She tried to talk me out of an exam because I ""could be subjecting myself to a procedure I didn't need."" Isn't that true of ALL tests? The answer can always be negative but at least you know. Turns out I did need the test she didn't want me to take. Three days after the exam I only got by insisting her nurse told me she wanted to do surgery.   At the very least I would expect an attending physician to teach students how to be friendly but she was completely unaware of how to deliver this service herself; let alone teach it. Cold; curt; inaccurate; late; unreliable communication and unfriendly. I can't think of a positive thing to stay about her or her staff or the students except one student was cleanly dressed. [REVIEW_6] Walked up with a group to serve 10 - parents and kids.  After trying to get someone to come to walk up window; we left because they were ignoring us 5-10 minutes and no one else was waiting for walk up service. [REVIEW_7] Bleh!! Their food is so gross if you order late and for pickup. I gave them more than one chance and I regret it [REVIEW_8] A friend of mine recommended this restaurant when i told him i would be in new Orleans. I went with a group of friends with high expectations. Since we were 7 we waited for more than an hour to get seated; which we took in good stride we just sat somewhere outside and chatted. When we were finally seated; it took the them about 15 minutes to come and take our orders and then...the ordeal started; the waiter told one of my friends to hurry up and order(he had just delivered the menus) or he will go and serve another table. There were about 4 of us on the table who had not ordered yet and we asked if he can take our orders first instead while my friend made up his mind but no...he said we had to follow the order we were seated. We let that slide; but then he delivered the drinks in a leaking glass and the food took another hour to come. People who arrived after we were seated had finished eating before we even had our food. Needless to say...the whole experience was so terrible there was nothing special about the food. [REVIEW_9] First; I want to clarify that the service was great! Unfortunately the food sucked so hard that they only came out with the rare one-star rating.  I was really; really disappointed in the quality of food! It was basically inedible...the best thing was my daughter's French toast (which was still just average). My meal was hash browns covered in peppers & onions; salsa and cheese. The peppers & onions weren't fully cooked; the hash browns were like mush and it was smothered in plain old pace salsa from a jar. Sick. And so; so disappointing. Also incredibly over priced at $10 for a breakfast meal. We had 2 adult and 1 child meals; and used a free meal coupon and the bill still managed to be over $20?! When we go to Cracker Barrel around the corner the tab is $22 (no coupons or discounts) and we get way more food of much higher quality. Breakfasts will be at Cracker Barrel from now on! [REVIEW_10] 2 thumbs down. I Went there for my 1st ever  manicure. Another customer came in 20 minutes after I did; no appoint. either. She was there for gel manicure. 5 minutes later the girl sits us both down; then proceeds to start working on getting her set up with gel manicure. She was on her way back to me; and a lady comes in for an unscheduled eyebrow wax. She tells me it's going to be a few more minutes so she could wax her. So she was going to help 2 unscheduled women who came in after me. That's bad business. So I got up and left. They clearly don't need my business.",2
13,"[REVIEW_1] So... ima make this very short and simple just got a haircut from this place; thought I would check it out because of the great reviews of yelp.. worst haircut of my life.. it seemed like the hair stylist had no idea what she was doing. My hair is completely uneven. So bad I actually felt like crying and I am a 20 year old guy. I went to a different barber shop later that day so they could shave my head. Maybe they cut women's hair really nice but guys do not come here unless you want people laughing at your haircut. [REVIEW_2] I typically do my laundry at my boyfriend's house; but I had family who recently stayed with me and had a bunch of towels; sheets; and comforters to wash.  I was searching for a laundry mat that would be safe; clean and not full of questionable people.  I was so happy to find this facility.  It is clean; well-lit; and the staff is so friendly and helpful.  I was amazed at the speed of the laundry and dryer.  I completed 4 oversize loads ( probably equal to 8 regular loads) in just under 2 hours!  This place has security cameras; flat screen T.V's; magazines; wi-fi; clean bathrooms; vending machines.  It is a wonderful atmosphere to do your laundry.  It was not overly busy; there are plenty of washers and dryers.  I am so happy that I found this place.  Thank you LAUNDROMAT!!! [REVIEW_3] One of the best meals I've had in recent memory--I can't wait to go back! [REVIEW_4] The first time I've ever been to Lex Night club; it was for my cousin's birthday; we traveled from San Francisco to celebrate at Lex; and T.I was performing that night in March of this year.  We called the club a number of times to get a table with bottle service; they told us they were full but they had a table available they could give us for 500.00; we declined. my cousin then went online to the Lex website where they actually took our reservation and we were able to get a table with bottle service. GREAT!... we paid with credit card in advance; we were told we did not have to wait in line to walk right up and let them know we purchased a table with bottle service. when we got there we had to wait in line; we were told we had to wait behind the line divider; which we did; until we asked to speak to someone in charge of table service. we were then met by one of the guys from inside the club where he led us from line into the club; the club was fairly empty and plenty of tables were available and open throughout the night.  The table we were given was a make shift table that sat directly in the walkway of the stairs that led down to the pool area; so everyone that walked by literally walked through our sitting area. The service was great; the girls were very polite and accommodating.  we were there a couple of hours; watched the performance and were having a great time; UNTIL..... a fight broke out near our table; the club security came rushing in to break up the fight and drug the fighting party through our sitting area where our table and drinks were; everything spilled; everything was knocked over and around and the security simply pushed us all out the way and has us pinned up against the wall with nowhere to go; during this time the security guards that pushed all back out of the way had blood all over their hands from the fighters and literally stained our clothing with blood from another party.  after the commotion the club security started directing everyone out of the club through the side exit; we had to literally leave right then and there and were herded outside the building by casino and club security.  I let the staff know we had damaged items and wanted to speak to a manager they told me i had to go to the bell desk and file a complaint. but due to security forcing everyone out the building i could not do that.  since March of this year i've been in contact with the club manager and the club VP; they told me they can give me a free night with bottle service but could not reimburse me for my damaged bloodied property.  i went back and forth for months and all they told me was that they have procedures for issues like this and since i didnt make a report that night that basically im S. O. L....  Really? that's how you handle paying customers in your establishment?  great business ethics guys.... you ruined my personal property in your establishment; by the hands of your employees and you dont see having to replace my property is your responsibility?  i will never go here again and i will tell all my family and friends to do the same.. it's hard to believe that a casino would have a dishonest business like this in their facility...  and by the way; i was unaware of the death they had in that club previously due to A FIGHT...  found out online when i googled the place....nice .... [REVIEW_5] Winner's is hands down my favorite place to karaoke in Nashville.  While there are some aspiring country music singers scattered throughout; I feel more comfortable singing my random crazy songs here with a group of friends. A lot of downtown karaoke bars are 80% amazing singers; 20% random drunk people. I like that I don't feel that I'm the only bad singer out there when I visit Winner's!   Plus; you never know who you will run into at Winner's. One night a random dude came in and sang ""Friends in Low Places"" with someone from our group who was on stage; it turns out the guy is a well known songwriter in Nashville; and he WROTE that song. Wow.  The prices are reasonable and you are sure to meet some new friends! Plus I love the patio out front and the randomness that ensues!   Note: karaoke is only on Friday and Saturdays :) [REVIEW_6] Shane was the best !! We will definitely come back for him. Came in for a bachelorette and he was attentive; funny and helpful on suggesting fun places around the city to check out. We feel lucky having him ! [REVIEW_7] Lüke. One of the first restaurants in NOLA I chose to call my fave 4 years ago.   This thought still holds true today.   It's my fave because so many dishes have been my go-to since the beginning. Eggs in a jar...go-to; shrimp and grits...go-to; pain perdu....still shouting from the rooftops.   It's also my fave because of this reason; always changing and bringing the best to the table. Softshell crab BLT; croque monsieur; and beignets oh my!   I can't leave out the bevs... French pressed Joe and a French 75 to start your adventure in New Orleans.   Did I mention they have a spectacular looking bar? Go see for yourself. [REVIEW_8] Best pizza in Saint Louis. Whenever my family wants pizza; we always go to Dewey's. Great service; delicious salads; beer selections and plenty of seating. I recommend the Bronx Bomber and the Southwest BBQ Chicken. [REVIEW_9] Same great food as the other PJ's; just a lot closer! This place isn't as large as some of be others but maybe when their year round deck is it will be. Highly recommend for a game [REVIEW_10] Pork al pastor was delicious! Friendly staff and great service! Stopped in for lunch on a Sunday and got seated right away & they were showing the football games. Our waiter was attentive and our food didn't take long at all.",8
14,"[REVIEW_1] If I could give zero stars I would.  Service was slow and it wasn't busy. Order came out missing food. Place was disgustingly filthy. And the food....bland and super greasy. [REVIEW_2] From the looks of it; Helzberg really don't care much about the social media comments and their customer's satisfaction. Today my wife and I just came out of Macy's cancel one of the ring I bought her for Valentine's Day due to wrong size. I already knew their services have gone to the gutter in recent years; its worse than going to a car dealership; where you get judged by their superficial eyes. If they don't think you are going to buy; they don't want to waste a second on you. So I told the first lady who greet us straight up; I was looking for a diamond ring around $800; I showed her the picture of the ring we cancelled at Macy's; all I asked is something comparable in price for a gold diamond ring. She showed me one right away but the diamond was a lot smaller than what we were looking for.  But she was able to find another one; not perfect; but at least my wife liked. I asked her what is the best price she can give us; after some negotiation; she said there is a $150 discount; and because we were still unsure (the diamond was still a lot smaller than the one in Macy's for similar price); she said she would throw in resizing service for free. It was already around noon time; both of us were hungry and I didn't want to rush a decision like this; so I told her we will think over lunch and be back if we decides.   So later that evening; I got the chance to go out alone; so I went back to the store to make the purchase. Right away I made the mistake telling the ladies that are working there I was there earlier; talked to a tall older lady; and I'm ready to make the purchase. At the time there were three of them; one was busy with the customer; one was on the phone; then there is a lady completely free. But you can tell right away she does not want to help me since I was already here before; even she get some commission it will not be the whole commission. So she told me go talk to the lady on the phone... Then the lady on the phone doesn't seem to have any interest helping me either; kind of yelling across from the store to the other ""free"" lady something I didn't even pay attention. So I'm standing in the middle of them feeling unwanted by those two. Finally the first free lady ask me whats my name blah blah... after wasted few more minutes she finally asked me which ring. So I pointed to the ring and told her what price was promised me earlier. Again she asked my name (for what reason I don't know); then she asked me if I had the other lady's card (I wasn't very happy with the first lady's service to begin with; she often answered my question in a snobbish way as if we couldn't afford the more expensive ring like ""oh that's $3000...."" in a condescending tone. So even when I told her we will think over lunch she didn't bother to give me her card.    By now; the evening lady was trying to hint to the other lady I had no reference maybe she should just sell to me like a regular sale. The other lady obviously doesn't want her to get the complete commission (also it is breaking the industry rule). While all of them keep having the tone I was just making up the price which I was promised from the morning lady! So I said maybe you should call her up; most sales people who care about their commission wouldn't mind the phone call.  At first the evening lady doesn't seem want to (too much work to make a call you know); finally the other lady also suggest she should call. So she went to the back room for roughly 5 to 10 minutes (don't know why she couldn't just call right front of me; the phone is right there!)  She comes back and told me there are not even a $150 discount (even though there is advertisement for $50 off on $299 purchase; and we always get their catelog in the mail; usually is $50 for every x amount of purchase; the ring originally is $900; which made sense when the morning lady quoted $150 discount). On top of that; there is a free $300 speaker promotion going on for anything over $600; and the morning lady said I can chose $150 discount or the $300 speaker.   Anyway; my point of writing this review isn't even about not getting the originally quoted price; I sincerely hope who ever runs Helzberg Diamonds's marketing; online marketing; social media marketing or even if just the store manager who actually care about his or her store image; can take a look at their staff. The culture they are building has changed so much since we bought our wedding band over 10 years ago. I read few other people's review; they shared the similar feeling. Their staff are just bunch of vulchers.  I worked a commission job throughout my college years; I don't know what happened in recent years. these people on commission doesn't understand how to treat their customers; and just expect the customers pay their paycheck. This mindset became very sickening to the society! And they only pride on Mr Warren Buffeft's name but not his vision! [REVIEW_3] So here recently the staff has apparently decided to just close up shop whenever they feel like it regardless of posted business hours; sometimes 7:30; sometimes sooner.  Makes you wonder if the owner or franchisee knows that.   The place improved for awhile and now it appears to be headed down hill again [REVIEW_4] I LOVE the Fountain!! This is my favorite restaurant in St Louis! All of their food is delicious and interesting. Not your ordinary sandwiches and salads. Obviously the ice cream and ice cream martinis are great but I am partial to the Hemingway which is absinthe and champagne! [REVIEW_5] Without a doubt one of the worst experiences I've ever had my life was presenting myself at the emergency room at Temple Hospital. Five hours before I even saw a triage nurse. Then I was told I had a life-threatening infection I needed emergency surgery.   They parked me in a room where I sat for two hours constantly begging for a glass of water. I kept asking what was going on I needed somebody to explain things to me; they said in a minute in a minute; we're waiting for the doctor.  I finally came to the realization this is not the place I need it to be and got up and left against medical advice.  The next day I went to Bryn Mawr Hospital and had my surgery there along with a two-week hospitalization. I was treated so well I felt almost as if I was a guest at the Ritz Carlton.  Dr Floros saved my life. It turns out I had a MRSA infection and had I waited another 48 hours I would've been dead. Doctors amazing nursing staff I couldn't ask for more! [REVIEW_6] Coming from a person who's whole family is from the bayous of Louisiana it's ok. The roux on the gumbo is a little to thick. Gumbo over jambalaya is almost insulting. Po boy wasn't a po boy it was more like a Hoagie with Cole slaw a semi blackened chicken. The flavor is kinda close (if you are a rookie to this food). If you have never had REAL creole/Cajun food you'll love it. I am of creole descent and I grew up on this food ;but like I said if you go to Louisiana (especially bayous were it started not new Orleans) you'll know what I'm talking about. For rookie creole/Cajun palates it's descent though. [REVIEW_7] My family and company used mayflower in late sept of 2013. What a complete mess; from the packing to the delivery. We moved from Southern California to Minot North Dakota for work. We had so much damaged items that it was hard to keep track of. We were told by a rep that our items had been off loaded to a warehouse after loading up at our house to be loaded back up in a moving van (with air ride) well this didn't happen; the same rental freight trailer that was used at the loading showed up at delivery; another lie from the company.The scheduling date was a mess also; the funny thing is the company reps in Minot tried to blame us for their mistakes. We have been in contact with California for this to be resolved and to this date 1-3-14 we still haven't received a call say sorry for the f!?"" Ups. Our salesman in California turned out to be just that a salesman; he didn't give a rats a!$ about anything and refused to return my calls. I would never recommend this company to anyone. Please check out other companies first !!!  Hey mayflower executives I am sure you know who I am ; feel free to call me to apologize and to get input on how this should have been handled !! I would not have given 1 star except it would not let me continue to post !!! [REVIEW_8] What a disappointment. This place was not good I would suggest you think twice before selecting this option. The manager and wait staff may possibly be the worst I have ever encountered; rude and definitely not focused on customer service.  The manager is a very angry hostile fella I asked if I could get brown rice instead of white and he blasted me...I offered to pay extra and he stormed off? Do not know what the deal was but this is just plain unprofessional and creepy behavior. The waitresses will smack into you while you are eating...man what a mess this place is from top to bottom. The food just OK at best! I am seriously complimenting them here... you can do better at home than here. Seriously I am not going to go into you have been warned just yuk...OK? these other folks with the positive reviews for this place must burn off their taste buds with adult beverages. (Didn't try the sake it may be the high point of the joint...but why would I want to expose my taste buds to a substandard meal to enjoy some rice wine? I can do this at home.  Here is something I am not sure of; I have only lived here a few months now; is it customary to charge for each soda every time you get a refill here? I was charged for each I asked why they said ""This is how we do it here."" So at $2 bucks per 6-8 ounces of beverage you may want to go with water at this place...but smarter yet! Go elsewhere. I will not be returning to this establishment.  Worst yet. [REVIEW_9] I absolutely hate coming here to pick up a package. It's difficult to locate and they have terrible service. They are not even set up for customer traffic at all! And I only came here because it's impossible to set up a convenient time for a package delivery at my home. [REVIEW_10] Ok well I'd heard so much about this place i had to try it. Well NEVER AGAIN! Dirty Dirty Dirty! Rude service. Chicken parm outrageous over priced. N never in life had chicken parm covered in black pepper. Would of sent back if waiter ever came back to table. Bread was so old n when asked for new i was questioned if i new what i was talking about. Well since i grew up in the food industry. I think i know. N from dirty table clothes. Too dirty glasses not once but 2x give up on clean one. If it wasn't for husband stopping me complaining right then u would of heard it all in person. I know restaurant have off nights. But this was beyond OFF.",1
15,"[REVIEW_1] Prices are absolutely ridiculous! They charge almost $12 per item to dry clean. I should've realized something was amiss when I didn't see any signage that talked pricing. Shame on me for not asking first but every other place I've ever been charges $4 or less. The employee couldn't articulate what; precisely; causes the increase in price over the competition. I will assume that little angels kiss the clothes clean. [REVIEW_2] DO NOT GET LASER HAIR REMOVAL DONE HERE!!! I purchased a Groupon for 6 sessions and 8 sessions later barely saw any results. Keep in mind that I am a perfect candidate for laser having fair to medium skin tone and dark hair.  The staff's reaction to my concern/frustration was ""well everyone is different"" and that they would do an ""in house Groupon"" if I wanted to buy another package. Why would I waste more money on something that didn't work in the 1st place?? I should also mention that I'm not the only person who did not have good results; a friend of mine had the exact same experience at Co Capelli.  I'm not sure if their laser is bad or if the people administering it just don't know what they're doing; but I didn't show up for my 9th appointment (I would have had to purchase more sessions-NO THANKS). Funny thing is that nobody even bothered to call and ask if I needed to reschedule; which you would think is pretty standard when you miss an appointment.   However; there is a silver lining to all of this. The Groupon gods must have taken pity on me and an offer popped up recently for  Hairfree Nashville; a place that actually SPECIALIZES in hair removal  (it was even $10 cheaper than what I originally paid at Co Capelli). I was hesitant but decided to give it a try and WOW...amazing results after the 1st session. These people are REAL professionals (not some girls who decided they needed a break from cutting hair and wanted to play around with a laser). I didn't realize how awful Co Capelli actually was until I experienced Hairfree Nashville. The space is lovely and does not reek of salon chemicals which is an added bonus; and the staff is VERY knowledgeable about the process of hair removal. The laser itself is 1000 times better and blows a cool stream of air so it was MUCH less painful. I was also given real goggles to shield my eyes that fit like sunglasses; not the uncomfortable metal tanning bed goggles that mess up your eye makeup which Co Capelli for some reason has opted to use.   Bottom line- if you are seriously considering investing the time and money for hair removal please do not make the same mistake I did. Go to a place that actually specializes in laser like Hairfree Nashville. You will not be disappointed! http://www.hairfreenashville.com/ [REVIEW_3] This place has the freshest food! I love the crispy chicken ranch sandwich; I'm not really a big fan of the ranch sauce so I usually just get the soy mayo instead! I've also tried the taco arugula salad; and the corn soup all of which were super good as well! [REVIEW_4] Third Degree was commissioned to create an Eternal Light for our synagogue's new sanctuary in Deerfield; IL. This is one of the most sacred of fixtures in our new sanctuary. Together with our architect; Finegold + Alexander; a design and concept of both metal and glass was conceived. With guidance from Riggo Design; a metal artist in Chicago; Third Degree engaged Troco Custom Fabricators to jointly create the eternal light.  None of the parties involved in this project had ever designed an eternal light. We did our research; discussed various concepts and then worked with Doug Auer and Michael Moran for the implementation. We then held our breath as Third Degree and Troco did their work.  The result is magnificent: A breathtaking sculpture that has our congregation in awe!  The only thing better than the fixture itself was getting to know Doug and Mike and their genuine hearts - which illuminated everyone in the process. [REVIEW_5] Went on Saturday night for the 9:45 show to see the headliner Bob Marley.  Arrived early and had a drink before the doors opened.   As we were ushered we were asked whether we wanted to sit on the main floor or up a bit further in the back. Really appreciated that!  The servers were friendly and the service was quick for the amount of people in there! Being DD it was nice that they did not charge for a glass of water. (Thank you!)  The host; comedians and the headliner were really funny and kept us laughing all night. What a great time out! Can't wait to return with a group of friends to do it again! [REVIEW_6] Still waiting for the gift card apology that was promised. Maybe their oversight or just a comment on Yelp! to make customer service appear better.  It has been almost 6 months and still no gift card. Customer service not a priority here. [REVIEW_7] First time I ate here was mid july sat at the bar had the mac n cheese and a drink. My friend had lobster and everything was so good. Only problem I had was that they charged my bill to my bestie card and my card smh. Came back for my bday August 8th had the crab bisque which was awesome and the lamb pops was seasoned perfectly. Not to mention the birthday monster margarita was bomb.com.  I would come here to eat every week if I could. The food is awesome :) [REVIEW_8] Went here last night. Giving it a 5because our waiter Colton was superb. Everyone from the hostess to the guy that seated us was very nice. The food is still very good. Great job 5 Star!! [REVIEW_9] If I could rate them less than one star I would. I had the worst experience here. I felt discriminated against; disrespected; and attacked. The place was over crowded because they over sold tickets. We were asked to move from where we were standing because it would block the dancers from walking by. However; they brought out chairs from the back for other people to sit in that same exact spot. The second time we were asked to move because a couple wanted to sit behind us and couldn't see. A woman then turned a chair around and told one of my friends that the seat wasn't for her in a very rude tone. Next; two girls came in and stood directly in front of me which was also directly in front of the doorway where the dancers were supposed to enter; a server came to us and asked us to move again but said nothing to the two girls. We stated that we could not move where he wanted because then we would be blocking the view of the customers already standing there so he then asked us to move to the back of the bar where we would not be able to see anything. After that the rude woman (who told my friend the seat wasn't for her) had her husband tap my friend and ask could she switch places with me because she was too tall and blocking everyone's view. There was no room for us to switch spots so I said no and continued to try to watch the ""show.""  He then tapped her again and asked did she want to sit down; she said no she was fine. He proceeded by pushing the chair into the back of her legs and forcing her to sit down. There was no staff around to assist us with these issues and there was hardly any room to try to find someone so we left before things got anymore out of hand. As we stood outside getting ready to leave a couple that lived next door overheard us talking about how disrespected we felt they chimed in and said that many of the people there are impolite and rude. I will never again in my life recommend nor visit this establishment. [REVIEW_10] Delightful tea shop in south philly.  Though I'm usually one for a beer and a cheesesteak; I found myself in here on a lazy Saturday afternoon; and was pleasantly surprised.  There's more tea than I can shake a stick at; but I stuck to what I'd call an experimental smoothie.  The young couple that own the place told me they'd fix me up something sweet and caffinated in a smoothie form; so I went with it and it was delicious (Matcha-Banana flavored).  Will return.",6
16,[REVIEW_1] For a $16 haircut; I was expecting an OK-looking trim (all I really needed was some damage control - just someone to lop off my split ends and maybe add a few layers).  What I got was a very professionally looking haircut that works well with my face shape and made my hair a lot healthier and happier.  My expectations were far exceeded - and it definitely surpassed my last 'professional' hair salon experience.  Plus; the shampoo smelled amazing and the girl was really thorough.  I wish I had brought more cash to tip her!!!  The only thing you should keep in mind before going is time.  I had to wait an extra half an hour and it was the longest haircut I've ever had.  I would much rather have the student take the time to make sure it looks good; however; than have someone do a half-ass job.  I think it's important that the school has a series of steps and checklists their students have to go through to ensure they are giving you the best experience possible.  Just make sure you have a decent block of time in your schedule to relax in the chair! [REVIEW_2] Disaster! Avoid! Restaurant is extremely dated & service poor. Food is mediocre a best. Chicken parm was dark brown around edges & sauce had a weird after taste; almost like it had come from a can/tin. Instead of spaghetti; I had penne. Penne was terrible; pretty much crunchy with same strange tasting sauce as chicken parm. Would never go back! Avoid this place!! [REVIEW_3] Excellent fresh French pastry- so light; crisp; buttery you could suck down three or four before realizing what a decadent pig you were!! Toasted croissants filled with variety of meats; cheeses; veggies- all so good!! Coffee excellent; espresso spot on.  This is lunch and breakfast bakery only- so no booze but none needed.  Very bright clean French  cafe like decor; friendly staff.  Great place! [REVIEW_4] Delicious ice cream with topping. Fudge and raspberry toppings are great. We'll definitely come back here in the future. There are still a lot of things to try. They only don't have espresso coffee. [REVIEW_5] I was looking for a new salon and this one was recommended to me by a friend. I made an appointment for just a haircut to start. Amanda was my stylist and she was really great. She was knowledgeable; checked in as she worked to make sure I liked it; and very friendly! Overall; I will definitely be returning and probably booking color services as well because I had such a positive experience. [REVIEW_6] I was in town for business and after checking into my hotel; I searched for the closest BBQ place. I wasn't sure what I'd find at Hendricks but I was pleasantly surprised as I was driving through the neighborhood. I liked the small town feel. Since I was by myself; I had planned on taking it to go and eating at the hotel but after walking inside; I had to stay to enjoy the decor. Light bulbs in mason jars; flat screen TV's and an amazing lighted patio. Although the view is just a parking lot; it's too bad it wasn't closer to the river behind it or had something else to look at.   I ordered pork steak (which I've never heard of before) and it was really good. It looked like a T-bone but was tender enough to be cut with a fork. For my sides; I chose collard greens and cole slaw. The cole slaw was awesome. I have a weird ritual where I always order the cole slaw at different places to see how they make it. This one is definitely in my top 5. The slaw was finely chopped and had ground pepper in it; which I love. I usually put black pepper in my slaw anyways but this one was perfect. Cold and with a kick. Collard greens with a bit of bacon in it was good too. If I had more time or with a group of friends; I'd definitely come back because everything looked comfortably country. [REVIEW_7] I'm not into beer so I can't speak for their product; but I had a very good lunch there one weekend. My friend's pizza order got mixed up and our wonderful server took a few bucks off (even though the pizza was still delicious). [REVIEW_8] Al's is located in ybor one block south of the busy 7th ave. I've passed by it so many times in the past but never realized it was a BBQ restaurant because every time I passed it previously; they've been closed. Also; the building just looks like a regular residential home when its not opened and packed with customers.  Last Friday; I made it to Al's around 8pm and they close at 9pm. Unfortunately; since it was late in the day some of the food items I wanted to order were sold out. In the end; I ordered the sausage and ribs platter with collared greens and okra; The food was so amazing and the staff was very helpful and friendly.  I will definitely be coming back very soon to try the other barbecue and side options. [REVIEW_9] I have used them for my business mail for years. They're great people and the service is excellent.  I can't recommend them highly enough. [REVIEW_10] Favorite thing about Mel's: nobody outside of Manayunk or Roxy knows about Mels. This is a TINY shack of a place that can hold maybe 15 people at a time on Umbria; which is a street with lots of older rowhomes and industrial/warehouse type buildings. Don't let the appearance put you off. It's divey; but good diners often are. It's cheap; and the food is fantastic. I get the veggie omelette (no cheese; and they have no problem accommodating requests for what goes in stuff... the cook is 5 feet from you and talks to you herself!); because the mushrooms and spinach are AMAZINGLY TASTY. I think they simmer them in wine or something.  The wait staff is super attentive and friendly; even for the neighborhood. Love; love Mel's.  There's a parking lot outside for free; and tons of street parking if that fills up.,9
17,[REVIEW_1] I had called at 630 tonight to see what time they were open until tonight due to the snow. I was told 10. I got there at 830 and even with a packed restaurant they would not seat us because 'they close at 9 tonight' why was I told 10? I also drove about 15-20 min just to get there so waste of time and gas. The fact we were turned away is rude and unprofessional; I get the early closing but maybe  they should inform the girl answering the phone. [REVIEW_2] Why did it just take over 5 minutes for me to get only a medium coffee?  Because there wasn't any coffee made in a coffee establishment; that's why. In addition; there are non-customers sitting in all of the outdoor seats and the floors and counters are sticky. I'm done with this Cosi. I'll be going to Brew Ha Ha from now on. The customer service is just too poor here. [REVIEW_3] I don't live in the area; but I found this place while working. It is absolutely incredible! The atmosphere is very relaxing and the worker I had; Ms Z; was pretty new but her hands were like magic! I felt totally refreshed after my session. I would go there every week if I did not live so far away. Everyone should be so lucky to find this place! [REVIEW_4] This store is TERRIBLE.  I will only run in for one or two things if I absolutely have to.  I love WalMart but this one - no matter when you go (I've even been at 5am) you will wait FOREVER and 9 out of 10 times the clerk won't talk to you... at all.  I've gotten a significant amount of items that were out dated; however they do have good prices overall and there is good parking. Oh -the ATM NEVER works too. [REVIEW_5] Burrito Ranchero kicks butt and takes names.  It's not for fussy people.  Simple but tasty food.  Authentic is in the eye of the beholder folks. Nuff said......... [REVIEW_6] Order and drink every craft cocktail one by one. You'll be happy to pull your gelatinous body into the Uber by the time you're done. Our server was a lioness who was born to roar behind the counter. She made my smoked Old Fashioneds the way Beethoven stroked the ivory...fast and fearless. The very next time I land in St Pete I know right where I'm headed; and you should too if you know what's good for you. This place could make a Quaker drink. [REVIEW_7] We were looking forward to trying out this newly redone restaurant. The atmosphere is fresh and well done . We were there for breakfast. They now have table service. Things were great until the food came out. My pancakes tasted like stale bread.  My wife's eggs were cold. The potatoes were not cooked. They brought the wrong side dishes. For silverware; we were given  forks but no knives. It took a while to find a waiter to get the silverware we needed. We did speak to the manager. She offered a discount of $2.50  not that we were looking one; but why bother?). However; she did not remove the extra charge for the incorrect side dish we didn't order ($4.00).  She did apologize for the food verbally but somehow we were made to feel like she couldn't care less. I don't write many reviews unless I really love something or dislike something. This restaurant fits into the latter category. Sorry. A nice decor is not enough. [REVIEW_8] Worst customer service ever; food is par by far; dirty tables; nothing like a real New York slice; I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is away from home in need of a slice of pie. I taste the time frame of some of the ingredients; Like they sat to long before being used. How could the great state of NY ever allow people who serve crappy food to use their name. [REVIEW_9] Crap. Period. Canned mushrooms on the veal. Oldest Italian restaurant; uh ok. How about good food prepared like nonna used to make not some underpaid immigrant line cook. Disgrace [REVIEW_10] Way over -priced . Burgers are very dry and tough .,3
18,[REVIEW_1] The place was clean; smelled great had fast service and the food was excellent. They have a massive beer selection. I tried gnocchi and had a few bites of the bison burger. We also had the jalapeño popper egg rolls for the app. All were great. I will def go here again. And our waiter; Christian; was the best. Very helpful and knowledgable about all the food and drinks. [REVIEW_2] Delicious.. love the variety of toppings!! The Staff was friendly and very quick. The restaurant was very clean and so we're the bathrooms. [REVIEW_3] Omg; my favorite lunch spot around here! I could eat here everyday it is so tasty! Great service; a bit small but still nice to eat in! [REVIEW_4] Awesomeeeee place. Came here with friends at 5:30ish for dinner to beat the crowds. The place is so cute and we loved the logo. We were seated immediately. The waitress was superrrrr friendly and helpful. We got the cheese platter called Ben's bread spread to split for the appetizer. Ohmggggg soooo tasty. Homemade honey and delicious cheeses and the bread was excellent. It was out of this world and worth getting. My sister and I then split the pizza with the spicy Bianca pizza. We couldn't even finish it all after that appetizer. Sooo delicious with the peppers and cheese and thin crust. We also couldn't resist getting a whoopie pie and brownie for the road. This place is a gem! [REVIEW_5] Just ordered delivery tonight; food arrived so hot and delicious we were so impressed. Absolutely delicious and reasonable pricing! Best Italian delivery around. We had the tortellini and another pasta dish and they were both divine. [REVIEW_6] topa topa brewing good beer very fresh and flavorful i try 8 of the beers and they all tasted really nice and fresh they also got food chill vibe chill people and good beer topa topa check them out yelp on yelpers [REVIEW_7] The staff was so kind; the food was delicious; and I love the location. I highly recommend the mojito and the cassoulet! [REVIEW_8] I can't comment on the service; as my wife picks this up and brings it home. But I can comment on the food; it's great. It's always fresh and tasty. I love the fiery habanero and usually get it on everything. We get food from here a few times a month; and it has yet to disappoint! [REVIEW_9] I finally can get to the business of writing a review on Ted Drewes since I have now tried a few other places; mainly out of driving convenience.  Wow; nothing else compares to the Picasso of frozen custard--Ted Drewes.  I have never had a poorly made custard here.   It truly is an amazing; artfully made dessert.  Plainly put; all of the other custard shop experiences have fallen far short of Ted Drewes.  I always receive a very creamy; delightful and flavorful frozen custard with the perfect mix in and the perfect balance of flavor.  Easily the gold standard. [REVIEW_10] The first time I visited the Deli I wanted to order everything off the menu. Our group ordered four different sandwiches; and all were delicious! They were very filling! They also have great blues music! This place was so packed on a Thursday night (no room to sit) so I would suggest getting here very early! I plan on going back; possibly for lunch so I can sit down! GREAT place!,10
19,[REVIEW_1] AWFUL. I have been there more than once; and it was never great but ok. However the most recent time we went was the WORST EXPERIENCE I have ever had at a restaurant. We were sat and no one ever came to our table; I had to go get them; she got us the wrong appetizer; the food was awful and cold; everything took forever even though the restaurant was empty!!! The waitress was just terrible; I had to go find her several times. We almost got up and left and I wish we had! At the end of it our check was wrong and I never complain but when I did finally talk to the manager she didn't even care and did nothing about it. She didn't apologize or offer any kind of restitution. On our way out I did see that waitress was eating at a table; that would explain why she never came to ours! [REVIEW_2] this place was awful. the first time my mother and I went we were very excited because everyone had been talking about it and we want to support local business. The day we went it happened to be pouring raining. So we are standing there at the hostess stand cold and wet waiting to be seated. Not only was the hostess not there; no one even acknowledged that we were there. The bartender who was right next to he stand was on his blue tooth and only looked our way to flirt with me. My mom was so annoyed we just left.   The second time we went was because we were going to be in the area and we decided to give it a second try. We were seated right away and the music was really good. The waiter could have cared less about our table. he acted like we were doing him a favor by even coming to the table. The menu was thin and nothing to really choose from. when he eventually brought the food it was decent. My mom hated her salmon cakes because they were overly breaded and poorly season. it honestly looked like two pieces of bread.   It was overpriced for what we had. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. The take out makes great dog food though. [REVIEW_3] Worst of the worst. Ordered three items and waited 40 minutes for the barbecued shrimp to come out. Told me the others were on the way. 10 more minutes and a small plate of rice came out as the Jambalaya. Asked what was supposed to be in the dish- chicken and sausage. No sign of either (or the catfish Poboy).  Finally gave up and asked for a refund which took another 10 minutes and refunded the wrong amount- at which point we had enough.  Stay away!! [REVIEW_4] The food is disgusting; no beef in fried rice; egg foo young gravy clumpy and nasty. Even the crabless Rangoon are way too sweet; they are not as good as some of the other local spots( China Dish) What cemented the one star was the rude employees that you have to deal with when asking for basic requests i.e. bean sprouts. When they don't have them and you sub extra white rice and they just open box and through them in on top. What a joke! [REVIEW_5] Terrible customer service! Avoid this place. They have a new policy to not help you with any set up of your phone. (My husband called corporate to ask about this policy and they said that they should have helped out.) They sent me home with the wrong instructions for setting up my phone on my own. It's been three weeks since I switched to Verizon and my phone still is not set up correctly. This place is a waste of time and is extremely frustrating . I wish I never switched to Verizon. [REVIEW_6] Used MegaBus for the first time on May2 & 4; 2014. The only thing it has going for it is the price. The driver got lost trying to find the CalTrain station in Sacramento and drove for over one hour on the surface streets of Sacramento; wandering and looking for the station in residential areas. Passengers tried to help her with directions from smart phones; but she wans't interested in any assistance. By the time we pulled into the station over an hour late; we could smell that something was overheating. First the driver claimed it was the system to open the luggage doors; as these were not working and could not be opened to offload and reload passengers luggage. She finally got that to work; and told us we would have to wait for a hot tire to cool off. Eventually all seemed well; and we left. Within 5 minutes of getting on the freeway; the driver yanked the bus over to the side while slamming on the brakes. There was an offramp approzimately 20 feet from the front of the bus; no idea why she didn't pull off the freeway. She announced the same tire was overheating and it was not safe to take the bus to San Francisco. Then she took the offramp and parked in a shopping center. Told us it would take at least an hour for a new bus to be brought to us; plus time to unload and reload the luggage. Meanwhile; the passengers start getting off the bus to smoke; buy a soda at the convenience store; etc. The driver came unglued and ordered everyone back on the bus; no one could stand outside except the smokers that were smoking with her.And the replacement was not a megabus; no wi-fi; etc. The portapotty called a bathroom was filthy; burn your shoes if you have to use it. The trip back was slightly better; also very late and had a stop to explore a smell coming from the bus. After my experience; I will pay to fly Southwest into Oakland and take BART into the city. I have no confidence that these bus drivers could handle a real emergency while driving and did not feel safe. [REVIEW_7] Worst sales man ever. I don't remember his name since he gave us someone else's business card. My girlfriend and I went into look at the jeep renegade and compare it to the patriot. The salesman shows us to a base model patriot let's us take it out awkwardly sits in the back and gives us one word answers on all our questions. I asked about fuel economy and he flat out lied said the car gets well over 30 mpg which it does not. Then tells us there are some great incentives on this car but doesn't explain what they are or how much they are. We come back not really liking the car he asks us how much we want to spend we say a low number he laughs and walks away and says to look online at their used cars and come back. We ask to see the car we came to see and he dosent even acknowledge our request;I asked about a truck I was interested in and he wouldn't even let me look at it or take it for a test drive. This is the worst customer service I have ever received we could have possibly bought two cars from this dealership but I will be taking my business elsewhere.   It sounds like another reviewer had issues with the same sales man; he should really be fired for making this business look so bad. [REVIEW_8] I had the worst duck that I have ever had.  It was so tough that I could hardly cut into it.  The cherry sauce was uninspiring at best.  My wife had a curried sole; in which the turmeric was overwhelming.  The only creditable thing was that they agreed to take the duck off my bill. [REVIEW_9] Couldn't have asked for a better location but horrible maid service and not worth the price. Horrible communication between the staff. The room was nice but didn't include a mini fridge or blow drier. The wi-fi was also a problem. It stopped working and when I asked the front desk about it they told me to call a number.... Which I was on hold for too long with. The pool was heated and had a nice view but one night was hot tub hot and the next was luke warm. Wouldn't recommend this hotel. [REVIEW_10] This place is horrible . Terrible customer service and very slow . Drinks were overflowing on the table as well,0
20,"[REVIEW_1] The drinks and the customer care are the only redeeming factor to this place. Not an authentic Mexican food- order chicken enchiladas without cheese or sourcream and the chicken was crunchy...like old rubber crunchy! Sent it back got beef tacos much better but the beans were super dry. The group said the beef was good. Probs wouldn't come back. [REVIEW_2] Horrible place!!! I went with a friend to keep her company decided to get my gel polish removed from my acrylics. The lady was horrible she rushed to take them off and when she was ""finished"" I still had polish on every nail and she ruined the shape of my nails. Never going again! [REVIEW_3] Wow this was proof that Texans can't BBQ it was at best a warm attempt at southern BBQ meat only had a slight smokey flavour; pulled pork was dry  the slaw had zero dressing; the bean I spit out sweet garlic unpleasant taste;the potato salad the dressing was good ... the side ribs were whacked off and tossed on top of everything  did I bother the owner by going in to buy food about as personable as getting bunched in the face;last when a person comes into your BBQ joint no take home sauce I give fired up a D-  needs major improvements and to the pony tail goof go buy a personality  there was only one BBQ king and he passed away four yrs.ago Smokey Joe would have told ya take your ass back to Texas [REVIEW_4] Took forever to deliver and I am just blocks away. They claim one driver had ten orders to deliver; ridiculous! After the almost two hour wait; WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!! Just the weirdest shrimp scampi I have ever had. They tried to do too much with it. The only good thing was the sweet potato cheesecake. I would give the cheesecake five stars and that's the only thing I would ever get from here again! [REVIEW_5] Definitely not what it used to be when it was ""Christine's twisty treat"". There's sofas outside and it's an eyesore! I also went there before for a strawberry banana smoothie and the girl working said she didn't know how to make it bc she wasn't trained. [REVIEW_6] Ordered a couple of pizzas for delivery. I swear a cheap frozen pizza tastes better. It was semi warm; bland; and they must have been low on cheese that night. [REVIEW_7] Worst Wawa in the Tri-State area. Always full of druggies; weirdos; creeps; panhandlers and the worst deli staff ever. [REVIEW_8] We never bothered going because the staff was so rude when we called to ask a few questions that we wound up hanging up on them. [REVIEW_9] Love this place! The turkey; beans; and biscuits are amazing. Have had better pecan pie but that won't stop me from coming back :) [REVIEW_10] I have been to many TeX Mex places in my life and was really disappointed in the place. The service was really bad and the did was mediocre bland and not worth trying out. I gave them one star but will not go back.",1
21,"[REVIEW_1] Small portions. High prices      The food here is overpriced for the small amount of food they give.  In the seafood combo. They advertise as if it is a generous amount of food and when it comes they give you 4 shrimp.  How cheap and ridiculous.  The poboy is more bread than shrimp. If they want to charge high. They need to give you more food.  Avoid this place.  It will just piss you off. [REVIEW_2] I almost don't want to rate this restaurant 5 star....only because I'm selfish and want to keep this place under the radar.  I've not had one thing on the menu that wasn't delicious; and I've eaten here at least 6-8 times in the last 3 weeks.   Steaks are delicious; and if you like pasta; Try the Tuscan Gravy w homemade fettuccine. If you've had breakfast at their beach location; you find some of the same items; but some prepared differently from the beach spot.  I had the sausage gravy and biscuit; it was probably the best I have ever eaten. My companion ordered the lox eggs Benedict and loved them.  Happy hour 2-6 everyday with drink and app specials. I love the Thai Chicken Flatbread  There is Outdoor seating; and two indoor dining areas. Great ambiance and the service is quite good as well. The drinks are generous and delicious.  Parking can be a bit tricky; nut go around the corner and there's parking behind and a back entrance. Enjoy; and I might see you there! [REVIEW_3] Don't do it.   I brought my VW in for service 3 weeks ago-turns out I needed a new accelerator.  My car sat at Walker for 3.5 weeks before my ""service director"" called to let me know I can pick the car up at my convenience.  Okay; so I pick my car up.  Drive it home.  Go inside to prepare for work.  About an hour later; I go to start my car to begin the drive to work... Car wont start.  I immediately called VW.  They played dumb; but told me to send it back to them.  That was a week ago and am still waiting on a return call regarding the status of my vehicle.  Overall; the customer service sucks; the actual service sucks (and VERY expensive)  What more can I say?  Walker VW can be the kiss of death for your car. [REVIEW_4] Don't think twice. Come to Heffe and order the hot dog sandwich. It's a hot dog; butterflied and grilled; on a bun with the most bonkers flavors and textures. Extremely messy. Insanely tasty. Oh God; so good. [REVIEW_5] Fantastic service and delicious food. There were a few vegetarians at my table; and our server Ritchie Rich (fabulous server) was able to make great recommendations and accommodations. The service was personal and attentive. The food was tasty and priced reasonably for a nice sit down restaurant. Another bonus is being able to make restaurant reservations since so many places in NOLA don't take reservations. [REVIEW_6] Went in with a friend for a bite to eat before doing some bar hopping. For some reason the menu to me seemed somewhat limited but I might be alone on that. It's not pricey but for the type of food they serve I feel like it's slightly over priced and in my opinion that food wasn't out of this world. It was average at best. We tipped our waitress 15% and she was slightly rude to us on the way out. Overall not a fan...there's much better places out there to spend your money. [REVIEW_7] The French woman who owns the place ruined the experience for me.  She doesn't seem to have any respect for her stylists or staff.  Her concern was that halfway through my haircut; there was hair on the floor.  She whispered to my stylist to leave me and next thing I know my stylist is coming back with a broom to sweep up the hair. Who does that??  I have short hair; and not much of it so it looked like a really pissy move.  I felt intruded on; and such empathy for my stylist who; by the way; was the ultimate professional and gave me the best hair ever!  I don't patronize a salon; I faithfully follow a talented stylist.  Flamboyant untalented French lady ruins it for me every time.  Hoping my favorite stylist moves to another salon soon! [REVIEW_8] Would give zero stars if possible. Let me start with the caveat that the band is fantastic; I would give them five stars. They are great performers and play very well (though I will grant that I do not know much about jazz). My complaint is lodged firmly with the people that run Preservation Hall. I didn't care about waiting in line; or the (looking back rather steep) cover charge. It was a little annoying that the room was set up more for a poetry slam than a jazz hall but whatever. No; my real complaint lies in how they have a ridiculous (imo) cell phone rule that they insisted on enforcing like the gluten-free ban at a Montessori school bake sale. When we got there there were multiple signs that warned against taking photos or video. This was really disappointing as I had really hoped to at least take a photo. But okay; as disappointing as it was; I hung in there (mostly because one of the people in my party really loves jazz and we had already paid the cover charge). The show gets ready to start and this lady comes out and gives this oddly pretentious speech (this is downtown NOLA; not Whole Foods) and reminds us like six times not to dare take a photo. This is only an annoyance at this point; like we get it; there are literally at least four signs in this room of forty people. Finally the lights go out in the room; musicians come out and I'm ready to chill. Now; one thing you should know is that Preservation Hall is that it is essentially a box of a room with large open doorways that lead out into a narrow hall that leads outside. The second thing you should know is that they leave the lights on in the hallway the whole time (they sell things out there). This means that anyone who moves around in the hallway is distracting; simply based off the light that attracts your eyes. Anyways; the music starts and for a few seconds it looks like this place just might redeem itself; like I said the jazz is great. Then; about two minutes in; the lady who lectured us before comes scuttling into the doorway where she starts peering into the gloom at the patrons. After a few seconds; she scurries back down the hall out of sight (again; this is really distracting because of the lights). At first I figured she was looking for someone or something but as she proceeds to repeat this performance every couple minutes I begin to realize she's policing the silent audience for the flash of a cell phone. Not only is this insane; (I didn't see a single person so much as twitch toward their phones) but if you have to police something with this level of intensity then maybe start a jazz club in a maximum security prison. After about twenty-thirty minutes the whole experience was so unpleasant that we all just left. 0/10 would never recommend. [REVIEW_9] I wish I had read the other reviews before setting this up for my friend.  Bottom line; she caught her plane; but very stressed.  Like other reviews; they scheduled the pickup 15 minutes later than requested; then arrived another 15 minutes after that. At another pick-up they couldn't find the passenger. In all 40 minutes late.  Given their history of such problems without improvement; this is simply no good. [REVIEW_10] Worst sushi place ever! First there was a bug on my roll then when they brought it back it was spoiled.  The manager asked me if I ever ate sushi before. My husband food was cold the waitress said it was just made but that was so far from true.  DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE!!! 2 THUMBS DOWN",3
22,"[REVIEW_1] Salad was full of brown wilted iceberg lettuce. The pizza was cold by the time I arrived home (picked it up.) Way too expensive for this awful product. [REVIEW_2] Will never go to this dealership again.  Got a written price quote via email for a Honda Odyssey. Went to the dealership; but they did not have the color and model I wanted (in which case why quote a price; but lets just ignore that as agressive marketing.) We agreed that they would add a DVD player to a lesser model; and also agreed on the price - this time with a printed quote in my hand. Went back after a week to close the deal and pick up the van; but they wanted a higher price; in effect renegging on the deal.  I walked out.  Went to a different dealership - Burns Honda - where I got the model I wanted and at the promised price. [REVIEW_3] High pressure tea sales!  Good teas but outrageously expensive.  Try Republic of Tea or even good old Twinings. [REVIEW_4] I came here on vacation with my husband via Yelp reviews. This place lived up to the reviews.  Everything was delicious! We ordered the scallops; rice bowl with steak; Mac n cheese; lamb sliders; and cookies and ice cream for dessert.  The stand out for me though we're the mac n cheese and lamb sliders.  I'm a huge fan a mac n cheese and this has to be one of the best I've eaten.  Service was great. We didn't have a wait got there around 6pm on a Thursday. I would definitely recommend this as a place to eat in New Orleans.  Btw I'm stopping by again for mac n cheese to go before the end of my trip! [REVIEW_5] i didnt want to give up a star but... the place sucks! [REVIEW_6] My boyfriend and I went for dinner on a Friday night. We sat at the chef's bar which allows you to see the food being prepared in the open kitchen. It was fun to watch until we noticed that one of the cooks was tasting the food with a spoon then continuing to use the spoon to cook the food. He did this with every dish he cooked; reusing the same dirty spoons to taste; stir; and serve everyone's food. We reluctantly ate our food anyway. It was tasty; but we both got sick the next day. Will never go there again. I would have said something to the head chef; but he was present in and around the kitchen the entire time; so I had to assume he saw this too and did not care. [REVIEW_7] Smoking allowed. There; I said it.  Good equipment; lots of room for players; and a nice area for spectators.  But they allow smoking.  EDIT: Lowering to 1 star after ""Peter F."" posted his ridiculous claim that spending $22;000 on an air filter makes any difference in protecting his customers from deadly carcinogens...he should do his homework: https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/air-purifier-smoke/faq-20058555 [REVIEW_8] Saji did an AMAZING job on my wedding dress. She altered it in time for an important photo shoot and always had time to meet with me. I can't thank her enough for the fabulous job she did; as well as being reasonable with her fees. She even has my gown steamed for me. Thank you; Saji! Photos to follow! [REVIEW_9] I was visiting Tucson recently and was told to try Agustin Brasserie by a local patron I had met. First of all; the place is beautiful! Classic; stylish; clean and very welcoming. Felt comfortable upon entering. Service was top notch; my service was by a very knowledgeable woman named; Heidi. I had a hard time deciding what to order and after she questioned my taste; she recommended the salmon along with a perfectly paired white wine. I have to say; best salmon ever! I'm from Seattle; so I know salmon. The meal was fantastic and her service was stellar! I am sad I live far because I would frequent Agustin on a regular and I'd be so happy to return for her service!  THANK YOU Heidi and Agustin Brasserie! I will be back next time I am in Tucson! [REVIEW_10] I am from California and was looking for something besides the hotel dining room to have dinner at.  I usually use the Yellow Pages to find restaurants and judge them by the size of their ads.  Spiro's jumped out at me; not because of the size of their advertisement (small) but Greek food just sounded good to me tonight.  I wasn't disappointed at all.  The Greek lemon soup was excellent and I liked the Moussaka; although the waiter suggested the Sea Bass.  All in all; the dinner was terrific and if I am back in this area; I will head to Spiro's again.  Thanks Neil for the wonderful service!",4
23,"[REVIEW_1] HandleBar is a great!! A great two hours and would recommend any night of the week! Arrive early & grab one of the seats without pedals or up front that take all the work! The stops were spot on! The drivers adds to the great time too. [REVIEW_2] Ready to fall in love? Want your little broken heart to be mended? 2 words...Seafood beignet  See below for your directions to bliss:   Tucked in a little adorable neighborhood in New Orleans we stumbled upon this hip little joint called Katie's! While we had heard it was the best place to eat in town we weren't convinced until....you guessed it; we took that first delicious bite of their famous seafood beignet stuffed with crawfish; shrimp; crabmeat; onions; cheese; jalapeños;mozzarella and topped with a jalapeño aioli....a religious experience to say the least    As an appetizer we were convinced that it couldn't get any better than that and then...BAM  The Bordeaux was delivered...A pizza topped with Cochon de lait; roasted garlic; spinach; red onions; scallions and a garlic butter cream reduction...We were left speechless by the unmatched flavor; the perfection of the dough; the Cochon literally melted in our mouths...  Perhaps one of the most delightful culinary experiences I've had in quite some time! I'll let you be the judge! ‍ [REVIEW_3] This place is a gem.  My favorite spot in the funk zone to hang out; especially on a Sunday afternoon. Sip on a glass of wine or try a beer sampler- whatever you are in the mood for! They have both; unlike most wine tasting spots around there. If it's a chilly day; warm up by the cozy fireplace and relax by the lounge area... or if it's a warm day you can people watch on the wrap-around porch in the front.  Corks and Crowns is a classy; friendly place for locals and visitors alike.  And they are dog friendly. Did I mention they also have cupcake pairings for your sweet tooth? So decadent and tasty... I think I'll head over there now... [REVIEW_4] WOW!  What a fantastic place!  Food A+; Service A+++  We started with an appetizer of cheese curds served with a red pepper jelly.  LOVED IT!  I ordered the fish tacos and the wife ordered a beer brat for dinner.  We both thoroughly enjoyed what we ordered!  The portions were huge and priced just right for the portion size.  Our server was on it!  Very attentive and was very knowledgeable about the menu and made us feel very welcomed.  The manager stopped by and asked how everything was.  I let him know that I am pretty sure I have found a cool new place to hang out; have a beer and watch football.  He said they have great deals on game days and let us know about their brunch on the weekends.  Everyone said goodbye as we walked out and reminded us to grab a rootbeer candy on our way out.  I will be back! [REVIEW_5] This a cozy little place; hidden downstairs off of 15th street.  It was my first time trying afghan food; and it was delicious!  Very reminiscent of indian food; so i have a definite bias there; but it's an amazing meal for around $6.  If you go with friends; you can order a bunch of dishes and get a variety of veggies along with a plate of rice.  They also offer three different salads (greek; afghan; and i cant remember the third); only one of which i liked (the afghan salad); but it comes along w/ur meal so its not a loss at all.  definitely will be visiting again soon! [REVIEW_6] Still so far so good my order is shipped and and will be here on Saturday:). Also I call a 1800 # and always get an answer! Just incase for the people who couldn't get an answer. When I get and try out my product I will update again :) [REVIEW_7] Excellent menu with locally sourced food that constantly changes. A delight for your taste buds. Reservations can be hard to get; so plan in advance. [REVIEW_8] I always have a great time here and usually make friends. Really diverse crowd of folks; and it's a really welcoming; inclusive bar. Karaoke is fantastic and the host is really nice to me and it always makes my day.   Also they have a really good milk porter on tap that's just delicious.  Oh and they have a vending machine THAT YOU CAN BUY A BOOK OUT OF. That's worth a trip right there. [REVIEW_9] After a long hiatus from reviewing I have awaken from my 6 mouth yelp hibernation and my tummies a grumbles with an insatiable hunger for the cacophonous symphony of flavor that is Indian food. Like an all too familiar pattern; I go back to Mohammad Butt; my main man for marsala. But whats this?  There are whispers that he no longer cooks for ""Best Taste of Asia;"" that he is gone; never to return; some sort of falling out.  No. No; it can't be!  I need to score - one .. final .. hit..  Life ceases to have meaning; existential murmurings dog the mind. Who am I? Why am I here? What is Cheeze Wiz? Its done; over; a round falls into the chamber and just as I prepare to end it all and pull the trigger- steps in ZAIKA.  Zaika - meaning the art of taste -  stays to to its name. This is a place where the Paneer (cheese) is made fresh in house; resulting in a cheese that's silky in texture. Especially when in contrast to the prepackaged rubbery bone-white LEGO blocks most small Indo-Pak places purchase from Indian Grocers in attempts to reduce prep-times. While at Zaika such shortcuts are not taken;  the Chef takes the extra steps needed to ensure a dish comes together as a whole. For example; the Chicken Makhani uses Smokey Tandoori Chicken; which I have never seen done before but it certainly aids the chicken to cut though the rich buttery tomato sauce and elevates the dish as a whole. Even entrées like Dall Fray or  Palak Paneer  have so much flavor that they will leave you not missing animal protein in the least should you choose to go the vegetarian route.   Zaika 's appetizers; like the Veggie Samosa and Aloo Tikki; (spiced potato patties) are generally large; peppery and well spiced - the latter of which remind me of something my own mother would make. Though I must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop-up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers; unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment. These peppers are spicy; not deveined or even seeded. Further; I find the fish pakora to be far too fishy.   I've become rather taken by Zaikia. Even the simply things such as the naan are good there. Just right in elasticity; the bread does not have too much give and yet isn't too soft. It's nothing elaborate; just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor. The only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has. But hey; I use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix; so I don't mind at all.  The menu has nearly 120 different items; all numbered to order by; making take-out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem. Furthermore; it has short descriptions of each dish - something all ethnic places like this should have. Though some items like Lassie (a frothy yogurt drink) do not appear on the menu; that too is offered - both a salty and sweet mango verities.  The head chef speaks English quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders.  I have already noticed parties negotiating catering for Ramadan as I anxiously awaited my own order.  The bottom line here is this; Mohammad Butt has expanded on the menu he once created for ""Best taste of Asia;"" and taken an all HALAL meat approach.   Only good things can come of this; only good things.  P.S. ZAIKA is right behind Nifty Fifties on Grant Ave.; so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake.  However; I would suggest getting the Ras Malai if available. These riccotta cheese dumplings flouting in soaked in sweetened; thickened milk are delicately flavored with cardamom; a very some amount of rose water and then garnished with pistachios. They are ungodly good. [REVIEW_10] Not impressed by the food or service.  Visited them for brunch about month ago and will not be back.  Overpriced mimosas ($7 each for a small champagne flute is ridiculous) and the food was just average.  My husband and I left because we felt very uncomfortable after the table next to us ordered salad; which they were out of lettuce; then french toast; which they were out of syrup; and a couple of other items I can't recall.  Oh; and no table visit by a manager!! I can't believe this place is still in business.  Our bill was $50 for 4 small mimosas; an egg & cheese bagel; and an omlet!  What a ripoff!!!",9
24,"[REVIEW_1] I have been here a many times now.  Great service; the food is delicious.  Their shrimp soft tacos are very good.  Family friendly too! [REVIEW_2] Awesome wings!!! We had the braised beef tacos; Chile coconut wings; and the pretzels. Everything was great! The beer variety is great too! [REVIEW_3] This is an awesome place to hang out with friends; shoot some pool; they have a small kitchen; and it's BYOB.  The staff is friendly; but for some reason - I guess local law - you need to be a member (no charge);  prices are good; and we've never had to wait for a table; not have we ever been rushed. [REVIEW_4] Wow! Amazing service. Didn't know grocery stores could treat people so nice. Made our beach experience so much better. I know most people don't care about the reviews to the grocery store they go to but I recommend you try this one out. You will find what you need and be guided by the employees. [REVIEW_5] Having just read about Marc Vetri and his eponymous restaurant in Bon Appetit (Sept issue); and having a scheduled trip to Philly; we decided to visit this much lauded Italian restaurant. You might have missed this place walking by it. The restaurant has only 35 seats; a very cozy atmosphere as you would find in typical Italian restaurants. Buon Ricordo (good memory) ceramic plates on the wall remind you that this chef travels to Italy often to further immerse himself in food.  The menu is updated weekly and changes with the season. They also offer 6 and 8 course tasting menus during the summer. We called just a day before our visit (they book 2 months ahead) we were very lucky to get in! The chef and staff were so welcoming and treated us like royalty! Here's what we ate:  Antipasti - huge antipasto round with lots of yummy grilled; marinated vegetables; smoky cheeses; mixed greens with grana; and freshly sliced ethereal slices of prosciutto done a la minute and brought to our table. We also ordered the Crisp Suckling Pig with Roasted Corn antipasto that was so delicious! The chef also sent out the Foie Gras Pastrami with Cherry Mostarda (the foie gras is ""cured"" like pastrami - this was such an amazing dish!).  For pastas; we ordered the Mint Pappardelle with Lamb and Sweet Pea Ragu and the signature Spinach Gnocchi with Shaved Ricotta and Brown Butter. Lots of butter in the gnocchi sauce! The gnocchi were almost entirely made of spinach - and just so light and delicate. The chef also sent out a taste of the not-on-the-menu corn ravioli with shaved black summer truffles from italy. Divine!  We decided to share the main course  - another signature: Roasted Capretto (baby goat) with Soft Polenta - it was out of this world! Chef Marc Vetri presented each dish to us; and this was especially incredible - they roast the goat outdoors for hours. It was so tender!   Such a great experience and we loved meeting Marc. He is an incredible chef and we will be back! [REVIEW_6] After 2 visits; I do not have one negative thing to say about Moto!  Both times we were seated in the front of the restaurant; in a corner booth on the window.  I recommend trying for a table in that area if you want something a little more private/quiet!   The staff is very knowledgeable and helpful; and during our second trip they somehow ""remembered"" us from our first visit months earlier - commenting on the date we were last there and seating us at the same booth. I couldn't quite decide if it was creepy or impressive. We're obviously in some kind of database; no one has that good of a memory of a one time guest!  The food was fabulous both times! I had the blueberry lasagna the first time because I was just too curious not to.  Don't let the name fool you; it's a mushroom lasagna with a blueberry balsamic drizzled on. Delicious; but incredibly rich. But I wouldn't have been able to finish it anyway since I stuffed my face with Wagyu beef meatballs as a appetizer.  (Same beef as Kayne Prime. Just as delicious.) Also proven to be delicious: the prosciutto crostino; black pepper tagliatelle; chocolate mousse cake.   The food is so rich that I could never be a regular; but it's perfect for an occasional indulgent night. Prepare to leave there fat & happy and maybe wear something with a stretchy waistband. [REVIEW_7] I have 11 pet rats and 1 cat; and it is very hard to find vets willing to treat rats; let alone who know how to (they have special needs.) Dr Bhatia is WONDERFUL! He treated my rats with much respect; he is reasonable; and called to check to see how they were doing too! My own doctor doesn't do that for me! I have found my new vet for life (my other lifelong vet retired in 2005 after I used him for 30 years). [REVIEW_8] I cannot fathom why the reviews for this veterinary practice are so low.   Birds are very good at hiding their symptoms and can be stubborn patients. I have two and I wouldn't let anyone treat them besides Dr. Ehrlich.   One of my little guys is getting up there in age and started having seizures and problems with his feet. My last vet thought the seizures were nothing to worry about; but Dr. Erlich knew better. She diagnosed him based on my description of his symptoms and a simple exam. She confirmed with a blood test that took only twenty minutes to return results.  Radnor Veterinary Hospital offered us a same-day appointment. Check-in was quick; and we were seen on time. Dr. Erlich spent a solid 30 minutes with us; explaining her diagnosis and her recommended treatment. She ran the test for us while we waited. And I do not feel I was overcharged for Radnor's services.   My primary care doctor will only see me same-day if I'm having an emergency. After arriving on time at her office; I usually wait 30-60 minutes before I'm taken to an exam room. My doctor has never spent more than 15 minutes with me. Radnor Veterinary Hospital is so good; I'd be treated there myself if I could. [REVIEW_9] Service has been great both times I've been there. I now crave the ABC burger. Delicious. Save room for a boozy shake. Yum! [REVIEW_10] We used the party room for a bridal shower.  The events manager Deneva was wonderful to work with and followed through on every single detail.  The wait staff was fantastic; and the food was exceptional.  We will definitely work with Deneva for any future parties at Cyrano's.",10
25,"[REVIEW_1] Bought my tires at Sears and got the warranty package for road hazard. Have brought my car in for low tire pressure six times since July. Each time they suggest an alignment; which I had done in July! It's been the same two tires I keep telling them that are low on air and to look to see if they have leaks. 4 times all they did is reset the TPMS system. I acquired a copy of the hand written notes! They did NOT fix the issues with the tires. In mid September; I was on my way to work when one of the two tires had a blow out. Brought it back to have them  fix the tire issues. I had to watch them the entire time to make sure they did the work. Before I was ready to leave they said I needed an alignment! Must be a money maker for them! I told them I had one in July. They did it complimentary and when I got the results; there was NOTHING wrong with the alignment! I waged a complaint to their corporate office. I was told the district manager will be calling me; that hasn't happened yet!!!  Back again for the left front tire today! Guess what? They say I need an alignment! NOT!  DO NOT BUY TIRES FROM THEM NO MATTER WHAT!  Spend the savings at a more reputable establishment! [REVIEW_2] The pizza had no taste and the wings that I ordered didn't even come buffalo; they came plain which I know for a fact I asked for mild wings... even the chicken was flavorless. Won't be ordering again. [REVIEW_3] Highly; highly overrated.  The food was a C minus at best.  And the service was so bad that I may never go back.  They screwed up my order completely and my no apologies.  There are a lot of other options around State Street.  Avoid this place like the plague. [REVIEW_4] Sunday not so fun day at Schlafly. Came in; cool music live outside. Go inside to grab a bite and drink.  We sat inside for around 15 minutes; no server. They had like 4 bartenders; two waitresses and 2 bar backs. Yet; no one even approached.   I do not recommend maplewood on Sunday at all. Bad experience. [REVIEW_5] This sushi restaurant was horrible.  First; when we walked in we were POINTED to our table; not actually walked to it.  No one smiled at us; and we were completely ignored throughout our stay.  We had 3 different people serving us; so we had no idea who our waitress was.  No one explained to us that the only option at ZEN was all you can eat; so when we ordered only 4 small items and received a bill for $56.00; we were astonished.  The waitresses simply ""dumped"" the food to our table....No smiles; no asking who the food was for.  I had to get up from our table to ask for our bill; as we were completely ignored and sat there forever waiting for someone to serve us.  I ended up complaining to one of the waitresses who laughed throughout the few minutes I complained.  DO NOT go to this restaurant....Overall a HORRIBLE experience!!! [REVIEW_6] Went here to try out the two basketball courts I saw listed......waste of my time. Neither one is playable and both have been seriously neglected. All of the rims are very crooked and bent down significantly. The pavement hasn't been redone in years and has grass growing throughout it. Hopefully they put the time into redoing it because a decent outdoor court in this area would be great addition to the park. [REVIEW_7] DO NOT do business with this company!  I ordered what their website is describing as hand-tied hair extensions (they even have pictures of  hand-tied hair in the description) and I was sent machine wefted extensions.  I have tried repeatedly to contact the manager; but every time I call; I am told that he is ""working in another warehouse"" or on today's call; he was ""too busy.""  This has been going on since I first tried to reach them on 03/08/2016; the day that I received my hair.  The current going price for machine wefted hair is $179 for the length that I purchased.  I was charged $275 per bag and had ordered two bags.    Today; the customer service rep paged the supervisor and he told her to tell me that I needed to contact Bohyme directly; as that Bohyme is who shipped the incorrect product.  Lo and behold; I go to Bohyme's website and it states that all issues with products should be directed toward the company that sold the hair extensions.  So; not only does this company false advertise; the manager will not provide any type of return call or return email.    Don't waste your money on www.houseofbeautyworld.com.  I wish I would have seen the other reviews of their company before I spent so much money! [REVIEW_8] I dined here yesterday with two friends and we all ordered shrimp and grits. When our orders were brought out; the shrimp and grits were cold and hard and looked as if they had been sitting out for a while. We sent them back and asked if they could send us fresh grits but unfortunately the new grits were the same. It was pretty insulting that they would even think that we should eat food of that quality. I have visited this restaurant many times in my past visits to New Orleans; but I will not return. [REVIEW_9] I wish I would have read the reviews before stopping here... I drove in looking to quickly get my tires filled with air because my light was on and I was having a difficult time getting them filled up due to my air valve extensions. I told them this and that I was in a hurry because I had an appointment to get to. I told them I only wanted them to fill up my tires and I didn't need them to do their regular inspection because my car is only 3 years old and had been check just a few months ago before moving here. After waiting nearly an hour I asked the man at the counter how much longer it would be and they took me in to the shop... at this point they told me the sensors in my tires either ""all broke at once or didn't have them in the first place."" The mechanic called two places and told me it would cost $800 to get these installed. I told him I wasn't going to pay that because it's not a necessary expense and I wouldn't be able to afford it. At this point I asked if they had even tried filling up my tires with air; to which he told me no. A different mechanic then filled them up with air and told me that the light probably wouldn't go off because of the ""problem with the sensors."" A mile down the road with full tires the light went off! This was not quick or convenient and I do not appreciate men assuming that I do not know anything about cars in an attempt to get me to spend more money to repair problems that don't even exist! [REVIEW_10] I have visited Mucho Burrito over the years here in the Edmonton Area; but this location by far is troubled.  In my humble opinion the more negative or cautious reviews of this particular location are accurate and are consistent with my own experience of the place.  For my own experience; the presentation and cleanliness of the restaurant is fine.  You are greeted with a modern looking fast food restaurant with some nice branding about clean eating.  But once you speak with staff the experience unravels.    I found staff to be more involved in whatever they are up to rather than customer service.  This can involve on going conversations amongst each other; or something else that is not readily apparent.  In any event; some staff are completely distracted or disengaged.  My order took a while to come out; and it required corrections which added more time while customers continued to line up.  Within 30 minutes after enjoying the meal; I became violently ill; and the rest of my evening was basically spent nursing myself back to normal.    I made a complaint many moons ago about this to Mucho Burrito's website; but be forewarned I did not get any follow up whatsoever from them.  This is a demoralized business to the core.    If you are craving Chipotle or some other Mexican branded place; do not come here.  You will be better off for it.  In fairness though; the Downtown location has been more consistent and I cannot speak for the other locations yet.",0
26,[REVIEW_1] Our second time we ordered from this place.  We placed an order at 600 told us it would be about 45 minutes. One pizza one order of fries and a hoagie and a bottle of Diet Coke. It's now 715 and a girl comes to our door with my husbands sandwich which the driver forgot to take with our order and asks if we got our food yet?  My husband said no we didn't.  Another half hour goes by and the kid brings us the pizza and fries which are ice cold.  Then asks him if he got his soda and again we said no. He said he would be right back;  1/2 hour longer he finally comes with it after we have already tried to eat the cold horrible food. Now I know I should ha e gone to pick it up since we are only right down the road but wanted to spend time with my grandson and have a great night.  It's pretty bad when a 6 year old won't even eat the pizza which by the way is his favorite.  NEVER AGAIN!  Wasted 30.00!!!!! [REVIEW_2] Quality of this store has gone downhill over the past few years. In the past;  I was able to easily choose from a wide selection of food at reasonable prices any time of day. I have noticed recently that the produce is not as fresh; but more expensive;  and the prices of the organic foods are more expensive than Whole Foods. This morning I debated on going to Wegmans or going to this store. I only had to get a few items so I decided on this Giant since it was closer. Big mistake. I have seen on average at least 3 or 4 people shopping around 5 a.m. In the past but today just me. They had all of the store roped off where it was impossible to get to certain aisles and very difficult to get to the register. In my frustration I went under a rope to get soup.  I was then berated by a number of people who were supposed to be cleaning the floors but some were just standing around doing nothing. I couldn't even walk out of the closest door because that was blocked off. If they needed to clean the floor they should have closed the store for a few hours. It would have taken less time at Wegmans which is where I will shop for now on. [REVIEW_3] This is what I've been waiting for!!! Finally a good wing spot in Madison. I just tried it for the first time and was super impressed! It's clean with awesome aviation themed decor. The wings were big; tasty; and fresh. I tried 4 flavors all of which were great. The seasoned fries were out of this world and you could see the entire process of prep from the table. Nice beer selection as well. The cook came out to the table to check on things and was very friendly. The prices are on par with most wing spots but their product is hands down better; I will definitely be back! [REVIEW_4] Best Sushi I have had in the area. Went there last night for first time. Casual atmosphere; friendly service and great sushi. The rice is cooked perfectly and holds together well but is not sticky. My wife and I shared a Tampa;  a Mexican and a specialty roll called the Paradise Roll. Fish was fresh and the rolls were excellent. I highly recommend this place. [REVIEW_5] This place is NASTY! . Floors; booths; sides of booths are caked with old food. Service was slow at best. Baked potato tasted like it had been baked 3 days ago. Will NEVER go there again. [REVIEW_6] Great drinks; food and atmosphere! A little loud if you are trying to eat out with a group of friends; but still a great time! Love the tropical touch! [REVIEW_7] This review is for the Laura/OakAlley plantation tour. The tours were great but the company can't take any credit. It's the tour guides at the plantation that are So Great!   This company has POOR time management issue!   After being picked up; we waited for about 20min to wait for the other bus to come then about 20 people were transferred to our bus. By the time we really started the tour; it was an hour after the pick up time.   Payment issue - I called about the discount I'll get if I reserve online. The woman told me to do it otherwise I can't get it when paying in person. So I did it. But; then the driver; half way into the tour; said now everyone please line up to pay. He used a tiny portable credit card machine to process everyone's card. It was slow  SLOW! The bus was full that day and it was 90 degrees out. It took him about 45min to get everything done plus he was confused about two groups of people who happened to have the same last name.   Really? It's 2013 people! The company can't take payment online or over the phone?  Why ask your customer to waste valuable time?   Though I had the email proving I've paid online. I was told that it simply reserved my seats and wasn't the actual payment. So paid AGAIN and of course got charged TWICE! It has been over a week and I haven't got the refund.   Because of this delay; when we got to the second plantation; we had about a little over an hour left because the driver said we  must leave at 5.    He told us to go straight to the big house but gave us the WRONG time when the tour would start. So everyone waited about 15 minutes in line AGAIN instead of just enjoying the beautiful garden at Oak Alley. (The tour is boring and the stories aren't interesting. I'd recommend people just spend all the time in the garden) By the time we came out; it was almost time to get on the bus and head back to the French Quarter. So Disapppinting. We didn't get to visit the beautiful Oak Alley at all.    Give me my money back; Cajun Encounter! [REVIEW_8] DON'T BOTHER GETTING THE GROUPON. The sushi was terrible and they DIDN'T HONOR the Groupon because I didn't present it when I was seated. I've used many; many Groupons in other establishments and have never been refused. I called Groupon and got a refund from them and reported that Yakuza did not accept it.  BIG THUMBS DOWN for Yakuza; thumbs up for Groupon. [REVIEW_9] I had one of the top three worst restaurant experiences of my life here. One example is that my wife got a lukewarm burrito and sent it back after talking with the manager. The burrito came back partly eaten....by the chef....as the manager said she has the chef taste things when complained about....AND SHE BROUGHT THIS BURRITO BACK TO OUR TABLE...THE MANAGER  (who said she is part of the founding family). This is after waiting more than 90 minutes for our food. On top of that; the food is mediocre at best. Now I've read El Charro is selling burritos at 7-Eleven stores in California....enough said. Do yourself a favor and go to Poco and Mom's or even Guadalajara Grill. El Charro is WAY past its expiration date and those running it now no longer know how to serve excellent; or even decent; Mexican food. [REVIEW_10] Slow service with an attitude; filthy dining and restrooms. Figured the first time they were having a bad day. Because I was craving Taco Bell thought I would give this location a second shot. There were two customers in line ahead of me and after waiting ten minutes to order and looking around at the state of the place I should have walked out. Guess I'm a sucker for punishment. Take notice and get this place shaped up !,3
27,[REVIEW_1] What an awesome price! They have an unreal atmosphere (cozy; beautifully appointed furnishing; on point decor) and I almost forgot I was in the thick of Rittenhouse.   Their intro massage was just $64 for a whole hour; and the therapist was incredible. She worked out months of knots from my shoulders; not an easy task.   You can tell that they really thought about every little detail-- I got to select my own aromatherapy scent and what kind of music I wanted to enjoy during my massage. That kind of personalization really helped me feel at home and relax.   And-- when my massage was over and I felt AMAZING; they gave me a complimentary little chocolate truffle. I still can't believe the price! [REVIEW_2] Never a bad meal at Ralph's. I wish they had a larger selection of less expensive wine; but I'm going for the food; not the beverages. The pasta is cooked to perfection and even when it's SWARMING with people; the service is stupendous. [REVIEW_3] I was just visiting St Louis/Clayton for a business trip. I was referred to Sauce on the Side by a colleague. It is amazing to say the least. The food is fresh and creative. I ate there 3 times that week! Super friendly staff. They even gave me the low down on the local beers!  Love 4HandsBrewing by the way! [REVIEW_4] The best cheese steak in Philly. Maybe the best cheese steak period. Anytime I even pass remotely by during a drive from Albany NY; I stop or make the detour to joes. Everything else there is also high quality. Clean inside and the service has always been good. If you want the best cheese steak; this is the only place you should go. [REVIEW_5] Now Hannah is there and my oxygen facial was amazingballs. She asked all kind of questions and had real solutions.  The experience was amazing and she was a pro and the room is upstairs and quiet and super cute. Finally a spa!!! I want to go back for micro and she also does body waxing!!!!! After my eyebrows she used something called a cool hammer to take the redness off my skin and I didn't look like I had a red Mustache for a day!!! I am super impressed and can't wait to go back. [REVIEW_6] Suzie was awesome! Great location; comfortable atmosphere; quick and friendly service. Looking forward to being a regular client from now on! [REVIEW_7] I cannot thank this Dobb's enough! Especially Keith. They did not carry the brand of tire on my car (Hankook) so he ordered it via courier as I needed my car fix the same day. When I had my car towed to their location; it was immediately serviced and I was in and out in about 30 minutes. Many thanks to Dobb's & Keith! Lifesavers. [REVIEW_8] This is an East Nashville mainstay.  They have an authentic Boston-style fish & chips that is excellent.  Also poor a great Guinness! [REVIEW_9] Our 6 year old wanted a chocolate cake for his birthday party. He picked out the triple chocolate. Usually I'm overwhelmed by the richness and density of chocolate cake. This cake was ah-mazing: perfectly moist; balanced sweetness and light icing. All our guests and; most importantly; the birthday boy loved it. I can't wait to trying more of their cakes! [REVIEW_10] Enjoyed very much. One of the best Indian  Restaurant I ever had. we are from Los Angeles and  Yelp lead us here. Tandoori chicken is a must try.,10
28,"[REVIEW_1] Awful. Avoid this place. I took my car here on a slow Sunday morning. When I got home I noticed a good size ding and scratch on my driver side rear door. I took it back and spoke to a manager named Chris. He was not helpful at all. His response was ""there is nothing here that would have done that."" So why was it not there when I came in; and now it's here. He had no answer or solution. I asked for the corporate number. He told me I could call his GM who will decide if it needs to go to corporate or not. Thanks Chris; very helpful.   When asking what their policy is for incidents; he could not give me an answer. All he would say is ""there is nothing here that would do that."" It's a car wash; thousands of moving parts and things touching the car. There is most definitely something that could do that. Especially when I watch the guys drying the the cars put the rags on the ground and pick them back up to continue drying the cars. Rocks; nails; anything hard.   I expected more. I cannot imagine this is the first time this has happened; and by the looks of how seriously they take responsibility; it won't be the last. [REVIEW_2] We were loyal customers for years; but not after our most recent experience! I got an oil change that took forever and included a tire rotation. The guy at the counter asked if I wanted; to which I replied ""As long as the best tires are up front."" So they did. I drove home and noticed my tires were noisier than usual; but didn't notice until I got on faster roads how bad they were. They had rotated; but the tires up front were not the better tires. They were closed; and were not open Sunday so I went to another shop open on Sundays. He took about 3 seconds to look at my tires and told me not only were they two different tires (not Midas fault; but I had never looked closely) but one was directional and on incorrectly; while the other had some really strange wear. He wasn't sure why they had put these on front; but cost me $22 to rotate them back so the good tires were back on front.  I emailed corporate; letting them know my dissatisfaction. I got an email back from Nate Heichelbech and he said he could fix my rotation and give me a coupon for an oil change. I explained that I had gone to someone else since I drive 60+ miles a day to work and couldn't wait. Further; an oil change coupon didn't take care of $22 repair. I simply wanted a refund for $22 and an apology since it was clear not a single technician looked at my tires before rotating. (Which I understand is part of their job) He said he could not refund a free service. I went on to say that was fine - refund the $60 synthetic oil change instead.    He then said he has documentation from the store manager that I insisted on the tire rotation even though they highly advised against it. Not a single person told me anything about my tires; nor was it indicated on any courtesy check or on my invoice. The manager was flat out lying. I offered to PDF him my documents.  All I wanted was $22 and an apology from Midas about a crappy job. In the last few visits I've seen a decline in the service and quality of work. What makes this worse is the resolution was simple. Instead; manager is lying and trying to say I wanted the worse tires up front - does that even make sense?!  We will now be taking our business to a place where deceit and poor service is NOT the norm. [REVIEW_3] Even the beer tastes better at the tap room.. Of you want a true schlafly experience head downtown to the tap room.  Better food; better service all around better experience. Every time. [REVIEW_4] I wish I could give zero stars to this poor excuse for a restaurant... On the way back from Philly to our beach house recently; my wife and I stopped in for a sandwich.  We were led to a nice booth and greeted by a young girl waitress.  My wife ordered a grilled cheese and asked for some DICED tomatoes in it.  The young waitress repeated the order back and said of course- no problem.  I ordered the veggie bean burger and she asked how would I like it cooked- which was odd; but I added ""medium please"".  I ordered iced tea for my wife and me and added onion rings to my order.  A full 28 minutes later our sandwiches appeared.  My wife's order came with SLICED tomatoes- no biggie- and she just ate it anyway;  I attempted to bite my burger and  roll and nearly broke a tooth on the over-microwaved wheat roll. My wife laughed as the entire burger fell out onto the plate splattering ketchup and mustard on my polo shirt. 5 minutes later the waitress reappeared and I explained that perhaps something had gone awry in the kitchen and she quickly brought me a new roll.  This one was mostly frozen... so I told her never mind- I'll just eat the patty and tomato/lettuce.  The patty was cardboard but I ate it anyway... my wife was busy dabbing my shirt to remove the mustard/ketchup stains when the waitress came back to apologize that the cook was overwhelmed by a party in the next room. (Odd; since there were only 8 or 9 cars in the lot outside.)  She was very timid about offering the explanation and I just accepted it as not totally her fault but rather (I assumed) an intimidating short order cook in the back somewhere.  Upon leaving; I advised the floor manager at the register very quietly about the roll and she made a face and took off three dollars from the bill since ""you ate the burger part""... with no apology or attempt at customer service. The waitress got her full tip.   I was so angry that I vowed to open a yelp account and DID!  Avoid this place at all costs. [REVIEW_5] Terrible delivery service & food order was incorrect once received an hour over what I was told.  All the food was under or over cooked.  Never again!  Sad [REVIEW_6] Do not go here if you are looking for a value for your money.  Their Tres Quesos comes in a tiny container around the size of mashed potatoes that you get from popeyes.  No lie.  It's $11.00   ELEVEN DOLLARS FOR CHIPS AND  DIP!!!!   Those chips better be dusted in gold for that price in my opinion!  To add insult to injury there are no prices on their menus.  Is this because they are too ashamed of their horrendous prices? [REVIEW_7] New to town and tried several in town but no availability on a Sunday. This place was open when I drove by so I stopped and they had a opening after 20 min wait. Pedicure was ok but gel nails horrible. Looked like fat marshmallow nails and so bumpy. Went to another salon few days later. Run down older salon. Needs lots of improvements especially learn how to do nails. Paid extra for opi nail polish instead of old nail polish they had as a selection. Waste of money and time. [REVIEW_8] 1. Bad service - all the waitresses were congregating by the cash register. not minding the place - food came out but we weren't asked what condiments we wanted nor were we provided any eating utensils. I guess it's a self service kinda place.  2. Bad food - old cold fries - unseasoned and overcooked burger. buns weren't even  toasted.  Don't go there for food. [REVIEW_9] Over priced . Every time I go there the owner works the register and changes the prices . He just guesses. Food has gone down hill the last 2 years also. I asked for sour cream an onion chips and he said he only had BBQ . Then after I payed I seen the other chips and asked for them and he was all mad. Then I asked for napkins ( they don't have them out ) and he was all mad again like I asked for his first born. [REVIEW_10] For the time and effort I put into ordering online 30 minutes before my pickup; I was pretty disappointed to skip the long line only to be told they 'didn't have anything' in their system. Thanks for nothing.",0
29,"[REVIEW_1] I made an appointment for my Chevy Volt for regular maintenance.  After waiting quite a while to be taken care of; we were told there was no Volt mechanic working today.  WHY WOULD THEY MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO WORK ON A VOLT WITH NO MECHANIC ON SITE!!??  IDIOTS.    The service advisor then spoke with the service manager to see if the car could be left and he could provide a loaner.  Mike Gullo; the manager said since we purchased the car at another dealership; they WOULDN'T PROVIDE A LOANER.  You've got to be kidding me!  What difference does it make where I purchased the vehicle??    I will drive where ever I have to in order to find another Chevy dealer with whom to work. [REVIEW_2] I would not recommend using Alexander Bourne or Patina Shoe Parlor for any service. This ""business man"" is not who or what he claims to be. He is not nice; professional; or reliable. I am baffled at this man's success within the local community; all things come to the light eventually.   My personal headache with this I met the ""proprietor"" out last summer; he was a nice enough guy; we had a bunch of mutual acquaintances. When he told me what he did; as shoe junkie I was happy to support a young local business as I too have a young local business; and strongly believe in supporting young entrepreneurs and craftsmen.   Fast forward to January; when I called to have my shoes picked up; as Patinas had transitioned into a mobile service. Alexander came to my house at 8am to pick up my shoes that needed repair; five pairs (4 heels; one pair of flats). He requested I pay upfront; being that it was early in the morning; we had numerous mutual contacts; and he is a young business with hesitation agreed. Thankfully I wrote a check tragically it was for nearly $250. What I was told I was buying was a six pair sole and heel package; the remaining pair I could call in at any time. A receipt would be emailed to me; and my shoes would be done in 10-14 days. 10 days later I call to inquire about my shoes; they are not ready. Day 14; I get voicemail. Day 20 I get hung up on. This persisted. I sent emails; Facebook messages; texts. I get no response.   Eventually I get a weird and vague communication from Alexander's ""assistant"". Nothing is resolved; and then I am blocked from any means of contacting the business and its owner.   In March 3 months later I run into Alexander; we have a hostile and rude exchange. He proceeded to call me a peon and other nasty names; denying having my shoes. In April I see this individual at another event; he laughs as I walk away knowing good and well what is up. Literally as I am prepping to sue this questionable character calls; yep I was that upset he calls and claims there was a mix up; he indeed has my shoes and will drop them off later that day. I give him my work address via a text and email. No response.   He shows up the next morning; doesn't say a word and shows me the 4 heels he has repaired. The work is not bad; I have had much better work done elsewhere without the drama. I inquire about my gold flats; give a description and am told he would look for them; No apology; no explanation given; nothing.   I get an email asking for the shoes to be described; which I find odd considering that I just did this; and that I would get an apology letter later in the day. In my response I suggest a refund; my other shoes found/returned or replaced; only to be answered with ""I never had your flats; and a link to his website. No apology; no receipt.   Funny; he doesn't have my flats like he didn't have my shoes; like he did not remember who I was in March before he decided I was all these terrible random things; and cursed me out.   The lies; deception and utter disregard for customer service and human decency is too much.  I responded professionally requesting a refund; shoes replacement; receipt; and apology. I got zero response.   This whole exchange was really frustrating; and unprofessional. At this point I am out a pair of flats; it's not the end of the world but it is disappointing. It's unfortunate that someone feels entitled to treat others in this fashion; to deceive and steal.  While I am elated that I have my heels back; the reality the work Bourne did was mediocre and his customer service is HORRIBLE! I will chalk this up as a lesson to be careful who I choose to do business with. Research everyone; and do not use Alexander Bourne or Patina Shoe Parlor for ANY  service. You will be disappointed; ripped off and or treated poorly. Just go elsewhere and save yourself the trouble. [REVIEW_3] Great place; go back all the time! My haircut and color is the best I've had. A fun place to have hair done; everyone is so friendly! I would definitely recommend this to anyone! [REVIEW_4] When I ordered delivery tonight; it gave me a 35-45 minute delivery time. The pizza arrived 70 minutes later. The pizza was cold and looked terrible. [REVIEW_5] Rude staff. Food was subpar and greasy. I got a breakfast sandwich and it was greasy and soggy. Coffee was terrible and the espresso machine was out of service. [REVIEW_6] I compare this hotel to a pig wearing lipstick.  It is still a pig.  Nice beds; yup; updated bathrooms; yes; new carpet in room; yes. Nice staff; yes. So why 1 star?  It is a dump and whoever decided to put all this new stuff into rooms that smell like mold and mildew should be fired. I am staying here for a convention so someone else booked the rooms as I usually look at reviews before making a reservation. Heading that it was a Marriott and that is was an Opryland hotel; I thought; oh it will be nice. After walking into the room and getting the nasty smell hit me; I turned to the Marriott app to look st the reviews as well as on yelp.  Many other complaints posted. I asked my co-workers and 3 of the 4 people that I am traveling with also have the same smell.   Note to the management team: shame on you for booking these rooms without fixing the problem. [REVIEW_7] It's been 10 years since I've been to a Shoney's; and I'll never eat at a Shoney's again. The people working there are nice and I honestly feel for them. The food was disappointing; though not inedible. The $11.99 buffet is a poor excuse for a buffet; we might have done better to just order something from the menu. I went with my wife and two kids on a Saturday evening and although they didn't appear to be that busy; it took 15 minutes to get a table and another 20 minutes to pay at the counter once we were done eating.   I don't really enjoy eating at Waffle House; but I would have had a much better experience at the Waffle House across Briley  I'm sure. [REVIEW_8] This is the worst place to eat! I love barbecue and the pulled pork was so dry I had to drown it in barbecue sauce to try and eat it! The wings were so dry; the collard greens were so bland that I had to put buffalo sauce and salt to make them taste somewhat decent. The food came out slow and we were starving. It was edible; that's about it! Had to place a order to go at tarpon tavern because I was still hungry after eating what little I had! [REVIEW_9] Cannot say enough nice things about Halo Hair and Heather. She gave me my first cut specifically for curly hair today and I LOVE it. She was really receptive to what I wanted; and honest with me about what would and wouldn't look good.  I knew immediately she was a great stylist for me when she asked me what I usually do with my hair and I said ""basically nothing"" and she responded ""my kind of client!""    The shop itself is super airy and bright; with a great vibe and cool music playing; and the prices were very reasonable; especially for such an awesome cut!  I'll definitely be back. [REVIEW_10] Just tried this place for the first time today and I'm so sad because I've been living here for four years and now I'm just discovering it! Super fresh breads; ingredients; home made soups; similar to fife and dekel but without the pies. Reasonably priced; and it's got a Grandma's sandwich shop feel to it (in the best way possible). I got a Montreal meat sandwich and the pastrami barley soup; both were SO good and I can't wait to come back here again!!",3
30,"[REVIEW_1] My husband and I come here often. We love the food here; it's always fresh and the service is great. We highly recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi & hibachi. [REVIEW_2] Decided to give this place a try on my lunch break and I have to say...I'm impressed. It's a little small but the decorations are pleasant l. Most importantly; the sushi is VERY good...and you get a good amount.   I will definitely be going back. [REVIEW_3] Hands down; my favorite sushi restaurant. Enough said. Always fresh and the service is always great. [REVIEW_4] I love love love this place!  I make a point of it to come here every single time I'm in Santa Barbara.  Every time!  I never order smoothies anywhere else as I have a badass blender at home and can make just about any type of smoothie I can dream up (and I do).  But I will go out of my way to pick one up from this place.  I don't know what it is but BB has cast some sort of spell on me.    Ugh; now I'm craving one... [REVIEW_5] Great donuts; great atmosphere.  Very good service.  The variety is fun and ever-changing.  Never made it for the sliders or brew; but maybe next time....  They do a really nice job of utilizing social media too.... [REVIEW_6] So basically; you are going to be having a student cut your hair...  There is a ""teacher"" watching; but I don't think they are any better since the ""teacher"" messed up my cut more than the student did.  The haircuts are cheap; so if you are looking for something really affordable and want to take your chances; then go for it.  It will really all depend on how good of a student you have and how ready they are at that time to be a real stylist/barber.  My cut just so happened to turn out horribly; but I prepared myself for that since I knew what I was getting myself into.  Just prepare yourself for the same if you decide to take a chance to get a cut here.  DO NOT do it if you definitely need to get a good cut for an event or something because it can potentially turn out to be tragic! [REVIEW_7] this place SUCKS. Terrible service and overpriced mediocre food. This is my second time with the same results. I gave them the benefit of the doubt -perhaps having an off night the first time I went; but it was the exact same the second time around. Nothing innovative. They churn tables out and could care less that you are spending upwards of $150 for two. Save this one for the tourists. [REVIEW_8] Nice; rivlas Grand Central Station in NY & Union Station in DC [REVIEW_9] The food was above and beyond my expectations from the previous Thai place that was there. The decor has changed the atmosphere of the whole place. The staff was very attentive and tending to everyone needs. [REVIEW_10] Chargrilled oysters were everything. I also had the Cajun red fish. They don't have many healthy options. Only green beans; that looked like edemame. I'm allergic to soy so I didn't take that chance.   Still overall the food was great and staff was nice.",8
31,[REVIEW_1] The 5 stars are for the uniqueness of this outdoor place for music; wine and food with a casual vibe. Sitting under the open sky; listening to live music with good wine - the recipe for a perfect evening. I had the kale and canellini soup; grilled fish -both dry good. The steak that my husband had; not that great. The goat milk panna cotta was like mousse and delicious.   The place was packed on a Monday evening at 7pm.   I'd go here pretty frequently if I lived in New Orleans. [REVIEW_2] Is 5 star reasonable?! YES!  I had turtle soup; pecan coated puppy drum; and bread pudding.  The pecan puppy drum was sooo good! It had a lemon butter sauce and it went so well with the fish. I highly recommend getting it. The portion is just right.  The bread pudding was to die for. It's a must to get their dessert.  Get their dinner meal. $39 for a 3 course meal. You can't beat that!  They also recommend wine to go with your meal so I really like that.  This is a good place for a romantic dinner :) [REVIEW_3] I have had a complete horrible experience every time I've gone here. No one answers the phone; you are put on hold forever; no one seems to know what is going on with your car; it takes two weeks to get an appointment; they give you an estimated time that your car will be ready and then they never call you to tell you what is going on. You have to end up hunting them down to get any information. The first time I went there I waited for them to call me to tell me what was going on with my car; one day service turned into 4 day service and when I finally called to find out they said it had been ready a couple of days ago. The next time I went; still no one called me to tell me what was going on with the car; I called them; they said it would be ready by the end of the day and then it ended up taking a week. The customer service is awful. They did a diagnostic on my air conditioner and couldn't find out what was wrong; I had to bring it back 3 times because everytime it was still broken. I've been without air conditioning for 1 month now because of all the back and forth. I ended up spending so much money on a car that isn't worth it. I would consider buying a new car but there is no way I will buy a VW now from that dealer. I'm going to Pit Stop on Earhart from now on. [REVIEW_4] From the second you walk in the door; you're greeted by the adorable woman at the counter. It seems if you come in here more than once a week; she'll know you're name but I haven't been so lucky since my visits are a bit more sporadic.  My most recent discovery are the vegetarian breakfast sandwiches; which are served all day! I particularly enjoy veg. sausage w/ havarti on an everything bagel. I could actually go for one right about now... I've also had the veggie club sandwich and my other half has enjoyed the chicken cheesesteak hoagie and the chicken salad on a croissant. Everything always taste fresh; they are priced really well  (I think my favorite bagel sandwich I mentioned is $2.09-2.99- cheaper than wawa!). The people at the deli are super helpful; offering menus if you can't read the one on the wall and will make great suggestions and accommodations to your needs and want.  Don't forget to grab a really great snack too while you're there- they have amazing chocolate bars; an incredible drink case; tons of chip varieties and those addictive hi-chew candies in every flavor.  I know i'll be back here; who doesn't like fast / delicious / attentive service? [REVIEW_5] I can eat sweets like no other and I've eaten them all over the world. Even at well known bakeries. And I've come to realize that I'm lucky the Flying Cupcake is here in Indy and that their cupcakes consistently make me happy. Their cupcakes are some of the best I've had and I haven't had one I didn't enjoy either. The cupcakes are large and reasonably priced. Sometimes I'm bad and I can eat a whole cupcake (sometimes two) in one sitting (#fatgirl@heart) but they're definitely large enough to share. The frosting to cupcake is at a good ratio. While I love them all; some of my favorites are the Red Velvet Elvis; Auf Wiedersehen; Pretty in Pink; and Pucker Up. They have some vegan options and seasonal cupcakes as well. If you ever get distracted by the bits and bobs they have in store; please take a moment and admire how freaking cute and adorable they are! The stores are usually clean and there are a couple small tables for you and a friend to dine in. Service has always been friendly. [REVIEW_6] Enjoyed a delicious meal tonight at Chappy's.  The trout special with a shrimp and lemon butter sauce was delicious.  Everyone in our party of four loved their meal.  The service was excellent. We will be back! [REVIEW_7] This place is wonderful! We found it today while looking for dedicated Gluten Free restaurants. The bakery is ran by a friendly; hard-working mother who's autistic son works there as well; and they only employ individuals on the spectrum.  The items were all great. None of the foods tasted any less as gluten free; casein free desserts. The cookie dough chocolate cupcake was especially good. I really like that they have interesting options too; like jalapeño strawberry bread; and the owner said they are coming up with new ideas each week and letting people vote on them on social media.  The owner went out of her way to be kind. She realized that our toddler is also on the spectrum; and she invited her to help water plants out front. The workers were perfectly accommodating and not phased by our daughter throwing a tantrum on the floor.  They definitely seem supportive of the community. I saw that their artwork on the wall is only from individuals with mental disabilities. They sell autism shirts there as well. Definitely a great place for the community! [REVIEW_8] Solid burger.  Especially from a chain.  Smash fries are great.   Hagen Daz milk shakes.  Yes please [REVIEW_9] This place is phenomenal; albeit busy as heck because everyone in the neighborhood and beyond wants their buffet. The waitstaff hustles and bustles to get to everyone. You definitely need to try their bread pudding  (more appropriately titled; banana bread pudding). All in all; excellent food and the waitstaff are in good spirits. [REVIEW_10] Miss this little gem more than we could have ever imagined!! While living in Carp we frequented Siam almost every week. The owners are absolutely wonderful and you can't beat the setting. The food is freaking amazing and I've never had a pad thai dish that I've liked better. Definitely try the coconut; mango; sticky rice; it's like heaven!,9
32,[REVIEW_1] Attended a party there. They now have a private room with your own bar and bathroom. I really enjoyed it. The buffet was good; didn't have to wait for a drink and you were able to hear each other talk. I would have a party there! [REVIEW_2] The food is great and the awesome owner who just makes you feel so welcome really ties in the whole experience. I went there for a quick lunch and just had and great time I stayed for an hour talking to the guy! And the free cuban coffee is and neat plus [REVIEW_3] Great place to go everyday. I saw huge changes in my strength and flexibility there. All of the teachers are unique and teach beneficial classes. I highly recommend a monthly membership! [REVIEW_4] Wow!!! Thank you so much for the awesome customer service and quality tint job! It is very refreshing to know that businesses like yours still exist -where customer service comes first and sound quality is ALWAYS produced! We will be sure to share our experience with others*=) -the one window-ed Versa [REVIEW_5] I loved working with Theresa! When I agreed with her on a price for my wedding dress alterations; I wondered if it would feel worth it in the end. It was! She made my slightly lower-end David's Bridal dress feel luxurious and perfect and look incredibly elegant with a beautiful bustle that stayed perfectly in place all night. [REVIEW_6] Gave this place another chance and definitely seems as though management has been working to improve it and it really shows. It's really great when management takes people opinions and critics and works to improve them. Well done!!! [REVIEW_7] Excellent fresh French pastry- so light; crisp; buttery you could suck down three or four before realizing what a decadent pig you were!! Toasted croissants filled with variety of meats; cheeses; veggies- all so good!! Coffee excellent; espresso spot on.  This is lunch and breakfast bakery only- so no booze but none needed.  Very bright clean French  cafe like decor; friendly staff.  Great place! [REVIEW_8] We spent about 3 hours here today with our 14 month old grandson. He had a blast! There are plenty of picnic tables and shady areas. All the children were mindful of him as he ran around in the water play area. It was pretty busy but it's spaced out so well that we never felt like we were in the crowd.  He also loved walking out on the pier.  We live in  Sarasota and I wish we had a park this beautiful. We will go back. [REVIEW_9] Read a lot of reviews that mention this is a must see while in Santa Barbara. It certainly was. The architecture and landscaping on the property was beautiful. There is a tower you can climb up to get a 360 view of Santa Barbara.   There were showing free movies in the evenings. [REVIEW_10] I love Ihop; I wish they opened branches in Sydney so I could eat there every week. We have been to this location a number of times; and my favorites are their omelets; especially Garden Omelet and Chicken Fajita Omelet.   We stopped here the other night just for their chocolate pancakes with chocolate chips and whipped -pictured-. They were steaming hot and totally hit the spot for us. Waitstaff always good and I always enjoy eating at Ihop. See you soon!,10
33,[REVIEW_1] All I needed was a written estimate.  A rather simple task one would think.  I needed my factory navigation unit in my Denali replaced; and needed to know costs and in writing.  Now this is a normal standard procedure for an auto repair shop.  Let's just assume its bad (it is); so tell me how much it is to remove bad part; and put the new one in.  Jay Fatimo or something like that; said he was very busy; as were the other service writers; so he handed me his card; and said to just email him with what I needed.  Sounded like a good plan; I wasn't in a big rush.  So I did just that; sent a picture of my vin; and the appropriate RPO codes to know what part I needed; and emailed it all to him.  I never got a response.  I tried again about a week or so later; still nothing.  Made sure it is his email at the dealership; etc.    I guess I have a hard time with taking my car in or trusting a place to do such repairs (3000 dollar job according to Winkel GMC) if they can't even respond to an email.  He knew I would email that day; and I did.    I guess the GMC dealer right next door gets my money instead. [REVIEW_2] I have been to a couple of Keke's in other cities; however; was exceedingly disappointed with my experience today. After an hour of waiting we were told our order was misplaced and it would be out shortly. I understand these things happen; yet the employees and manager made no attempts to make our experience better. The manager acknowledged once the food was delivered that the portions were small and inaccurate. However; icing on the cake was the waitress dropping off the check as we finally got our first bite. Not to check on us even during the rest our meal. If someone had made a single attempt to make our experience better I would not be writing this review; but today I paid for extremely poor service and I do not plan to return. [REVIEW_3] I used to come here a lot. However I will not be coming here very often in the future because the customer service seems to be lacking. My online order did not go through and this was very disappointing; they made me stand in line again and re-order my food and did not offer me any type of discount or compensation for this disservice. I asked to speak to the manager who also did not offer me any kind of compensation. They don't seem to care about customer satisfaction instead they were fine with the fact that my online order did not go through. So if you're reading this Panera please take into account that you should work to satisfy your customers. We order online because we have small kids [REVIEW_4] worst dealer by far stay clear of this place brought my van in for servicethe tech 35602 has made me wast lots of money and time after all the worst he has done i have the same issues he just had me replace my engine for nothing it still broken and my old engine was fine low milage ran great i took a chance but feel as if this guy is just throwing parts at my van rather then properly diagnostic time save your money go to falcony in speed way   update found techs name is josh like mine haha but stay clear of him [REVIEW_5] The worker was awesome; this is a review for the company.  The price paid isn't in alignment to the service provided; it is just expensive. The worker is still paid hourly; which motivates him/her to work the hours. I believe it is a better way to hire someone off craigslist and pay them to do a service; rather than hourly. [REVIEW_6] Wow let's start at the top. Walk in to put name down. I can see it's a wait. Get zero eye contact from the hostess with 4 other younger girls doing all the work I ask to put my name down. And was told it's 35 minutes. We wait and Get seated and order drinks. Get 1/2 of the drinks (water) waited 15 minutes for the milk and lemonade. Order right away. Took over 45 minutes for that to come out. Cold;soggy; waited to get refill of water and asked 2 times before my wife asked again. Then brings the water with old food stuck to the inside off the glass. Just about turns my stomach. Rethink going here. [REVIEW_7] Every time we go to this place; we go because of the enticing beer selections; but time after time we leave disappointed by a complacent bar staff that makes you feel like an inconvenience. It's such a shame. The beer selection is second to none; but this time we had one drink and decided to spend our money elsewhere for dinner. This place has been consistent for sure; every time we go; we get a miserable bartender who seems like they'd rather be working on a slow night when they don't have to talk to people. All of the enticing beer in the world won't bring us back.   The owners brother has a great place a few miles away; Brickside Grill; we went there instead...good beer; excellent food and the staff is consistently friendly and engaging! [REVIEW_8] Bad attitudes. Dry; rock hard pastry. Not worth the effort of going there or the cost. [REVIEW_9] This is the worst place to eat! I love barbecue and the pulled pork was so dry I had to drown it in barbecue sauce to try and eat it! The wings were so dry; the collard greens were so bland that I had to put buffalo sauce and salt to make them taste somewhat decent. The food came out slow and we were starving. It was edible; that's about it! Had to place a order to go at tarpon tavern because I was still hungry after eating what little I had! [REVIEW_10] The diner was extremely busy and the waitresses were being pushed to their limits.  The problem was the kitchen; obviously; when the food came it was dry and overdone; the sides came later; the desert was not cooked(rice pudding).  The waitress did offer another choice and we will see how that is later as after being there over 1 hr we brought home.  The owners or managers only seem to care if a substitute was made and who was your server but not that the kitchen staff is being overworked with this crowd and cannot be attentive to their cooking when being pushed like this.  The first manager pushed me to second manager and they really don't seem to care as long as they can push the crowd to fill the tables.  A few waitresses heard my complaints and thanked me as they said they have been trying to tell them this too.  Well; that is my last visit here as I would rather go up the street to a smaller diner (Club Diner) and get a better meal and more attentive staff.,0
34,"[REVIEW_1] This place is a joke. First; we had to go through 3 different people just to place a to-go order even though it wasn't busy. Then we waited 25 minutes for them to make 2 wedge salads. We got no apology. Total BS. [REVIEW_2] DON'T GO HERE FOR UBER. I have had the WORST buying experience of my life here. I walked into this dealership for the first time around the end of June. The sales people seemed helpful and answered my questions at first. I even came back a couple times before I made a decision on the car. On saturday July 2nd I made the deposit and was promised a car the following friday (July 8) latest. I patiently waited checking back a couple times throughout the week to get updates on the situation to make sure everything went smoothly. Not only was it extremely time consuming because they just didn't wanna help you out until your presence became an annoyance to them; they also kept lying to get me to leave; giving me deadlines they never met. They constantly told me that they would call me back and let me know but they never did. Today 12 days have past; and they still did not give me a proper response regarding the fate of the promised car. Today someone actually picked up the phone and after giving me a very unclear response about the fate of the car shut down the phone without letting me respond. Very rude. Who is going to reimburse me 9 days (taking out 3 days that they initially promised to deliver) of not being able to work? On average I lost more than a $1000 already by not being able to work and I still don't know what will happen. Forget about the money; the negative attitude and treatment you will receive here is not worth any money in the world. [REVIEW_3] I had a horrible experience here. The waiter was great but as I got my appetizer; there was it has a hair in it. Next the noodles came out mine was fine but my friend has a huge hair in his. I thought he was joking until he told me. After that it ruined my appetite; I gave the noodles back and they didn't even give me a new one; I thought I should've got the food for free at that point.. never eating here again [REVIEW_4] My Room was disgusting. The odor when I walked in was terrible. They had put a very large air filter in the living room to try and mask the smell. The carpet looks as if it was molding in the bedroom against the wall - looks to be the shower wall. Must have leaked.  No iron had to call in am and wait. Oh btw when I called to have someone come up and check the room and the smell they never came - nice!  You know Mgmt knows about the issues and are avoiding them. I'm a Hilton and Marriott frequent guest for business. Man this makes me not want to give Hilton my business. Starwood is now going to move up a notch as  top two property to stay at.   Oh the power went out in the hotel at 6 am ish. Not their fault as the waffle house next door had it power off too. It was freaky though to wake up in pitch black. Thank god for iPhone flashlight app!!! [REVIEW_5] this place is out of business !! anyone know what happened?  did they move? [REVIEW_6] DO NOT shop there! Driver decided to drive off with out fridge- after 4 hours on the phone resolution was a 10% coupon and delivery... In 4 days!! Worst experience ever! Unprofessional and rude! Would never shop there again. Beware!! [REVIEW_7] I received a vase of flowers for Mother's Day and they are terrible. I'm sure my son paid top dollar; because he always does. But this very small bouquet had only three roses that never opened and wilted within two days. The rest of the arrangement was cheap filler flowers. It came in a plain glass vase with dirty water and no bow or ribbon. They forgot the candy that came with it and had to deliver it later in the day. Look elsewhere if you are looking to send an impressive gift; because this one was not. [REVIEW_8] I went to see Dr. Taylor because a friend recommended him.  He did appear knowledgeable in many areas but did not listen to or honor the reasons for my visit.  Being a naturopath; he is familiar with both natural and allopathic methods of treatment.  Although his staff said he was familiar with the neurological issues I was asking about; he did little to discuss them with me.  He also did not ask if I wanted a more natural or allopathic approach.  He sent me out the door with an allopathic prescription for something he could have easily addressed with a natural approach.  When I called to cancel my follow up appointment; his staff was curt and dismissive and attempted to make me feel badly about cancelling.  He is not someone I would seek out if I was looking for a kind; respectful medical practitioner. [REVIEW_9] Where I think the meat and fish selection looks fine and they carry some exotic meats in the freezer I just cannot recommend this place. I had purchased a Groupon and was pretty excited about trying this place out. When I got there I decided to walk around the entire store to see what kind of goodies I wanted to buy. Once I got around to the back of the store buy the beer; wine and dried goods I started to smell the stench of cigarettes. At first I was willing to write this off as maybe a door was open by the loading dock. But then I walked by the office with the door wide open and two people smoking openly. I choose to ask them why they were smoking in the building and all they could do was write it off as ""smoking in the office"" and ""yeah it's a dirty habit"". Not addressing that it's ILLEGAL in the state of Florida to smoke inside a business like this; you know the whole Indoor Clean Air Act. Besides I don't want to buy what is supposed to be fresh meat and the like in a place that cigarette smoke lingers in the air. The only reason I bought anything was to use my Groupon but on second thought I should have just walked out empty handed.   I don't think they understand the purpose of Groupon. It is designed to get new customers in the door with the goal of becoming regular customers. In this case they scared me away from ever shopping there again. What a shame they could have something pretty nice on their hands otherwise. [REVIEW_10] Okay; I'm obsessed with the chocolate pancakes from IHOP but they are not worth it when the service is SHIT. My server comes to the table asked me what I wanted to order for a drink; I ask a few questions about the mimosas. He said ""No just Orange juice and Champagne"" I say then I'll getting something else AND HE WALKED AWAY BEFORE I COULD FINISH MY SENTENCE. I was appalled. This man was older so he had no excuse for his ignorance. I am so disappointed with this establishment. If I could give negative stars I would. Do not go here; it is not worth it.",0
35,"[REVIEW_1] Favorite Thai in the neighborhood! Great for takeout with excellent and diverse offerings. Love ending the meal with the peanut pancake; so glad to have found this spot and the curries are rich and thick (green is my favorite) filled with more types of veggies than one usually finds. Heads and shoulders above any of the Asian spots on the South St corridor. [REVIEW_2] I've been to Michael's a couple of times now. First; it's important to note that they are 24 hours; which is nice. Their french onion soup is really great and so is the red velvet cake (if you can get it!). I've also had breakfast at Michael's and that was delicious too. The servers are really nice; perhaps just refill the water a bit more. [REVIEW_3] This place is absolutely delightful. I am seldom able to sneak to this part of the city; but when I do and the hour is right; I rush here. The macrons are always to die for; each melting in your mouth (even after sitting in the quaint box for a few days). The Darkness Croissant is my favorite but so rich it takes multiple sittings to consume.   The Harry Potter themed desserts brought me in yesterday where I purchased a few specialties. The Tonk's Chouquette was beautiful and light with a fun cherry center. The pumpkin pasties went great with a cup of tea. I have the Molly's Meat Pie ready to go for my lunch today. Honestly; I could have gotten one of each of the new treats if my budget allowed it.  Overall; this place makes my day each time I visit. Staff is friendly and the atmosphere is elegant. Spot on. [REVIEW_4] I've been here twice recently to choose a wedding dress and then again to choose bridesmaid dresses with my bridal party. I made an appointment for 9am first thing in the morning because I know that these places get crowded. Both times the ladies at the check-in and register were very pleasant and we were helped right away. The woman that helped me through the entire process (Yvonne) was such a pleasure to work with and always made me feel special. From the first time I tried on a dress and was so nervous; to helping my girls with their dresses; to being there when I rang the bell and said ""yes"" to the dress. I have zero complaints and would absolutely recommend this location! Again; it's always smart to do your research and if you're going to show up on a busy day; make sure it's early  (9am right when they open is a very good idea!) and that you make an appointment! [REVIEW_5] New Orleans use to be all about service. My wife and I were running a few minutes late because our 1 year old needed to be changed right as we left the house. Mr B's would not seat my father until we arrived. It is time for Mr B's to get with the times. [REVIEW_6] I love this place and it's a shame that it's never beer busy when I come here. Their food is amazing and the owners and staff are so friendly and attentive! This is my go to bbq place in the area and will always be! The owners live above it and really care about the place. She chatted with us about their catering orders; so that's something you may want to consider if you're looking to cater something. They also do carry out and you can call in a carry out order. The daily specials are separate for dining in and carrying out however :) [REVIEW_7] Was recommended by a friend to eat here while visiting town for a graduation. Was not disappointed; food was exceptional and service excellent. The chips are made on site and were the best chips I have ever had! I ordered the tacos; one cod and one steak. I liked the steak one best. My nephew had the short ribs and they were great. I would order those if I went again. Very unique menu. Be prepared for the fact that there is no outside signage. It was a little hard to find. [REVIEW_8] I love banh mi and I will go out of my way to get a good banh mi. Much to my surprise; I discovered a new spot in North Wilmington.   For me; the banh mi thit nguoi is the litmus test for whether I would be a returning customer. If you're a banh mi place and you can't get banh mi thit nguoi right; then I have a hard time justifying coming back to your establishment.   Luckily; the banh mi I had today was very good. The bread wasn't too doughy. The pate and cold cuts were quality. The veggies were pickled right; and the fresh veggies were; well; fresh (like they should be). They didn't skimp on the meat either; which is always a big turn off.   I'm so glad this new place opened and is not too far from where I live. I don't have to trek all the way to Philly to get my fix. If you're looking for an authentic Viet treat; this is it! [REVIEW_9] Best Indian food in town. This place never disappoints whether I come for the lunch buffet or for dinner. I would eat here everyday if I could get away with it. My personal favorite is the chicken tika masala but everything I have tried has been delicious. [REVIEW_10] Service and food was absolutely HORRIBLE. Waited in the drive thru for a half hour before I could even roll up to have my order taken because the staff was serving out food so slow. Then once I finally got to where you place your order; I had to wait for 5 more minutes before anyone took my order. Then I had to repeat myself 3 times before they could hear my order and they didn't apologize for the wait or at least explain the situation. Then once I finally got the the window nobody even apologized for making us all wait for horribly long time. Once I finally got my food and it was cold as could be; the meat on my burger was dry; and had NO toppings on it and the buns were dry and hard. Worst service I have EVER HAD. Staff was rude and food was horrible; cold and dry",8
36,[REVIEW_1] Everything about this place was wonderful. The waitress was lovely and I loved the architecture. The food was amazing! I had a salad and green beans which were probably one of the greatest things I've ever had before. I definitely recommend coming here. Everyone is so nice! They even brought free dessert because they look so long on our order even though it wasn't long at all! Definitely come here! [REVIEW_2] Every time lm in Philly; this is a must have. Just right around the corner from my condo. Great service. Great food. So glad your right around the corner from me. [REVIEW_3] Oh. Mi. Gawd.  Eat. HERE!!!  Don't pass go. Don't collect $200. Eat. HERE!!!!   The bacon is to die for!!  The brûlée-d grapefruit - please can I have this every morning!!!  I got the fig & prosciutto toast. It's all soo soo soo good!!  I don't love breakfast but I may have changed my mind. The wait is a bit long but it is WORTH EVERY freaking second.  Try the champagne mojito for a nice refreshing twist on mimosas!!!   Eat here - have you figured out yet that your mouth and your belly will dance?!?!   Eat. Here!!!! [REVIEW_4] Great Jazz spot - No photos/videos allowed during the show!  They offer presale tickets for their shows. You can get them at the boxoffice but not day of - you'll have to show up early before the show to see if you can get in. Which is what we ended up doing.  The hall is pretty small and rustic looking. There are no bathrooms at all - you'll have to go across the street to the bar. Also; you can bring your drinks in.  The jazz show was great - lasted about 45 min. No speakers; no microphones. Just the music and the acoustics. It was nice.  Come early or you'll end up standing up. Theres about 8 rows of seats on each side that fit about 6 people each. The rows are pure wood- not really very comfy but what can you do. [REVIEW_5] This Nail salon is awesome!!! I made an appointment for me and a friend. The entire time we were getting our nails done; we were the only customers; which was great. They do accept walk ins; but the gentlemen suggested to always make an appointment.  The gentlemen who did my nails was excellent; he took his time; he was very patient; and paid attention to detail.  The women who did my friends nails; did a good job as well. My friends nails looked great. The salon has free wifi; I was offered water; and the gentlemen offered to put a movie on. I will definitely be coming back; and I would recommend this salon. ! [REVIEW_6] If you want The Best burger in Philly; this is the right place to come. The bread was fresh; meat was nothing but juicy; service was a amiable; price was descent and affordable to everybody! [REVIEW_7] We have rented from Milpas Rental for over 12 years to include major rentals for our vacation home remodel. I rented a carpet cleaner from them today as I could not get a carpeting cleaning company to come out on short notice. Upon using the carpet cleaner I run into a glitch. When returning the item I explained the situation and they were most accommodating. Thanks again! [REVIEW_8] I love this place. I'm actually shocked that I've never done a review. I've been to both Philly locations and this one and it's delicious. The food is fresh; the service is impeccable. Please be prepared to wait on the weekend because this place is popular.    Whenever we have guests in town we take them to them to Sabrina's to guarantee a great time.   If I can find pictures I will edit my review. [REVIEW_9] If you get nothing else on the menu; you must try the bacon wrapped dates.  They are savory with just a touch of sweet and snuggled into a yummy sauce with finely chopped roasted red peppers on the side.  Every bite was gorgeous.  I also had the butternut squash soup; which was very tasty and large enough to be filling on its own.  Then; I also added in some deviled eggs.  They were good; but spicier than I would have thought.  What made them spectacular was the little bit of crispy duck skin on top.  It made the whole dish come together.  We also sent our waitress back no less than 4 times to answer questions about the menu; and she was always happy to check for us. [REVIEW_10] Awesome food! Great service! Amazing owner! Best place to eat in Reno. Very cheap food considering the quality ; the cleanliness and the taste; you won't regret it if you try it I promise!!,10
37,[REVIEW_1] I haven't seen the book; but I think hotchickswithdouchebags.com is a hilarious website that.... Oops!  I forgot - this is a review for Pearl... in my defense; it's very easy to confuse the two.  I went to Pearl to see a DJ who I'd enjoyed at Silk City; but it was choch central and after one overpriced drink both my wallet and my soul were hurting. [REVIEW_2] Okay; this place probably doesn't need another 5 star review; but they did such a fantastic job on my wedding flowers; I had to weigh in.  I was an atypical bride -- I had no vision for my flowers.  I was also on a tight budget; and my wedding was less than two months away.  I basically showed up at Pure; told the designer; Jeremy; my price point; and asked what he could do for me.  I half expected this approach would be met with disdain; but Jeremy couldn't have been more friendly or helpful.  He asked me about my style and suggested cost-effective blooms (like hydrangea; because they are large and will make for a bigger arrangement) that perfectly fit my style (on the conservative side).  I also called and changed my order several times in the week prior to the wedding.  Pure was incredibly accommodating and on the big day; everything was exactly as I had requested.  And the arrangements were beautiful.  Just perfect!  From now on; I won't be ordering from any other florist. [REVIEW_3] This place is just awful. Great atmosphere; but food is just plain bad. I've given it too many tries. Done. [REVIEW_4] Made reservation a over a week ago with request to be near band. On arrival they had no record of it. And we are stuck in the back next to the bathroom. 5 stars for cocktail;food; band and Atmosphere. 1 stars for utter lack of organization.  The woman who took it said she was new. Always call to confirm I guess. Completely disappointed esp since we've had such amazing experiences here in the past.  There open tables near front and were told they were for people with reservations [REVIEW_5] I had not patronized McDonald's in many years as there are many other establishments that actually seem to work for their customers business.   It took over five minutes before one of the four employees asked gruffly if I had been waited on. I placed an order for a #1 meal which is their Big Mac. As I waited for 14 minutes to get my meal several other customers approached the counter  complaining about their order accuracy. I watched as several people had to repeat this process three or more times before getting their order right or they gave up in frustration. No staff member including the English speaking manager/supervisor ever apologized or acknowledged the customers exasperation it gave the assistance if caring at all.   I figured with my long wait that I would at least get a hot fresh meal but apparently my food must have been praised long before my arrival. I received a cold Big Mac that was half unassembled in the box with my side of cold soft fries. Not sure why it took 20 minutes from the time I arrived at the counter until I received my order since the time was obviously not doesn't preparing my food and there were not many other customers in the store.   Lack of employee engagement; lack of empathy and poor or no management seemed to be the order of the day here. How on earth they can keep the doors open with every customer on site complaining and NO response or concern from staff is simply amazing. [REVIEW_6] This place has really improved in the last few years . The deviled eggs are to die for ; the rolls  mouth watering ; caesar salad the best in the area ; prime rib excellent . The best pricey eating establishment in the Franklin area . Sperry's take note ! [REVIEW_7] So disappointed; I'm so embarrassed! This is a $50 mixed bouquet! Trader Joe's makes better arrangement! Mostly green filler with a couple mum; iris and Gerber daisy. [REVIEW_8] Avoid this place at all costs!! Worst Chinese food. Quality very poor. Table and menus were sticky; silverware filthy. Ordered Jazmine beef.... beef drowned in tons of sauce and grisly. They make you pay for steamed rice? What a rip off! Waiter Nathan provided the worst service I've had in years! Paid $17 for food I couldn't even eat because it was so disgusting. Waiter doesn't  check on you or ask how your meal was... nothing!! The fact that I left my entire plate should have given him a clue; but was oblivious. [REVIEW_9] Terrible mixed drinks. Our table got four different drinks and no on like their drink. I got the desert highball and it smelled like the fruit mix was spoiled. On top of that it was just bland; totally watered down. [REVIEW_10] Aw; man. I was hoping I'd previously posted a glowing review of RuSan's so I could prove that once upon a time; I liked it here. But; I didn't so just trust me on this one.  It is with a heavy heart that I relay today's experience over the lunch sushi buffet. Cold; gelatinous; and ~$11/each. It's been a year or three but I remember this being so much better. Don't get me wrong... I love cheap; fast food-ish; ethnic cuisine and I have lovely memories of the Ginger Simmered Beef; Fried Garlic and Bay Shrimp Salad Maki (like I said; once upon a time); but today? Lackluster is an overstatement.  With each bite; I kept hoping the next would be better. But; alas. It wasn't.   Why; RuSan's? With all your new neighboring restauranteurs in The Gulch; is this the taste of complacency? I shake my head in disappointment because I know your potential and cherish what we once had.   On the upside; my water was refreshing and the service was fine.,2
38,"[REVIEW_1] I am so excited about this hotel. It is really a hidden gem. We arrived at 8:30 am; planning to store our luggage until check-in time. The very friendly lady at the front desk; gave us a room immediately. She was very kind. They had a guy take up all of our luggage. He was very friendly. Once in the room; I discovered a nice room; nice tv; and best of all; AVEDA bath products. They even leave guest a travel kit with cotton balls; q-tips; and a finger file which we really needed after a seven day cruise. Hands down; best hotel I have stayed at; and I have stayed at many. If and when I return; I will be staying here for sure!!! [REVIEW_2] Absolutely the greatest ice cream that I have ever had! Went on an extremely busy night; but the employees remained friendly and were prompt with the service. We ended up getting the four mini scoops; which was enough to share. We tried the Cookie Monster; Creole Cream Cheese; I Scream Fudge; and the Cafe au Lait. There were all incredible and accurately represented the area. Fair prices and unbelievable flavors. Looking forward to coming back to try different flavors again. [REVIEW_3] Favorite Nola hotel! Great history and antiques; comfy beds; very clean. The pool area is great though it can get a bit crowded. We were there during jazz fest; and several band members and their relatives hung out at the pool.... fun just eavesdropping from the next chaise lounge! The Carousel Bar is also a must do. [REVIEW_4] update on this review. i went here last night and it was gross. i had a few pieces of nigiri (salmon) and it was warm and soggy. ahh gross. they were not that busy and I could not get my plastic cup of water filled.  The sushi was filled with packed; tight rice and cut in large; gigantic portions. i hate that.  It has always been inconsistent for me which sucks. they have def. gone downhill. will not be back there again. There are many other great places to eat. (hiroba; sushi pier never disappoints.) [REVIEW_5] This ""hole in the wall"" is FIRE!!! It was hard choosing from their extensive menu. In the end I enjoyed the garlic Parmesan wings and crinkled fries with nacho cheese. The wings are cooked to perfection... crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. We ate here yesterday and we'll be paying another visit before we leave NOLA. This place is better than any of the major WINGS places you've ever visited. Try it! [REVIEW_6] I ordered delivery; food was an hour ad a half late and cold when it arrived. I was told they would be sending a free drink and dessert due to the tardiness; but those items never arrived. When I called to inquire; they said they would remake my order - though since it had been two hours since I originally ordered; I was not surprised nor did I care when that never arrived either. Food; service and punctuality were all terrible. I recommend spending your money elsewhere - this was the worst dining experience I've ever endured. [REVIEW_7] I used to be a regular here when I lived close by. After moving away from the area I've been searching for quality sushi ever since. I've found good sushi in various places; but have always found them somewhat lacking. Over time I guessed nostalgia was overwhelming my objective opinion and Kaisen was probably not as wonderful as my memory told me. So imagine my delight when I revisited and found that it was not nostalgic remembrances but actual fact!   The sushi was as good; maybe even better than I remembered; the service the same.  This is without doubt my favorite sushi restaurant; not just in Tampa bay but anywhere.  From now on when the sushi craving craving strikes I'll make the effort and drive 40 minutes to enjoy the real deal. [REVIEW_8] This place is amazing! My friends and I just happened to stumble upon it; and we felt so lucky. It's delicious; affordable; fresh; and authentic. The people there even gave us a free extra dish just because they wanted us to try it. We tried it and loved it! [REVIEW_9] Wonderful vineyard great selection of red and white wines as well as ports. Karen was a great server. Today they had live jazz. It was a nice way to spend the afternoon. [REVIEW_10] You'll definitely have a wait for brunch but grab a drink and buckle in cause it's worth it. Everyone at the table loved what they ordered. We started with the buffalo cauliflower and got the pretzel pancakes; nooner; blueberry waffle and the red velvet waffle and damn if we didn't clean our plates. Also if you don't get the white trash hash you'll regret it for years to come. Service was great and our drinks were perfect.",8
39,"[REVIEW_1] Wanted to try this place for the first time. We pick up a menu to order later. A few hours later we called for delivery. After placing our order we wanted to pay with a debit card. They told us they only take cards in the store. Delivery is cash only!!  I canceled the order and call gin house. [REVIEW_2] DISCLAIMER: this review is limited exclusively to my single experience last night eating prawn mee noodle soup at Penang.  Review: this dish was admittedly very fishy; which I was generally okay with. It almost tasted like the restaurant added fermented shrimp paste or something similar. That's also not an issue; in itself. However; it is now 8pm; and I have still not yet left my hotel room since getting back from Penang last night. I'm currently having the absolute worst food poisoning experience of my life.  According to my primary care physician; aka WebMD; it is likely that I have some form of aggressive salmonella food poisoning.  The other dishes looked good; and I'm sure the prawn mee is typically not vomit/diarrhea-inducing; but i hope this issue is addressed promptly. [REVIEW_3] oh Millers; how i wanted to like you.  You are close to my house; have ample parking; and large spacious tables.  you even have a fireplace in the back for a little ambiance.   friends and i tried to come here 2 or 3 times for a quick/inexpensive* bite to eat and every time there was a 30-60 minute wait. we thought this must mean they are really good.  perhaps it just means that people in Springfield are willing to settle for a less than average dining experience.  *side note- this place is not inexpensive.   hubby and i ordered apps- he got zinger boneless wings; and i got the guacamole. portion size was ENORMOUS on the guac - it could have served 8 people; seriously.  flavor was meh. apparently the wingz were good.  hard to tell what hubby enjoyed more; the wingz or the scantily dressed hostesses.   our server was great; attentive and pleasant.  When something went wrong she did her best to fix it. That was much appreciated.   Side salad came out wilted and gross. management offered to take it off the check; would have rather had a decent salad in the first place but i digress.  Dinner was not very flavorful - at all - and portion sizes were okay. i got the quesadilla appetizer (which was plenty for an entree) but it was very sloppily put together and had no seasoning at all.  I have had food that is presented better and tastes better at fast food restaurants; where i am happy to pay $5 for a meal.    At the end of the meal; i badly wanted dessert but didnt want to risk another poorly flavored dish.  Not to mention; all the dishes were like lunch tray plastic; and i felt that a $50-60 dinner for two was at least worth a nicer presentation. who knows; it may have even made up for the bland flavors.   perhaps i was let down by the fact that there always seemed to be a wait and i had over hyped it in my head.  Never have i wanted to send back everything i ordered at a restaurant before this night.  i will never be back.  my husband says he will order the wings; but takeout only. no more dining in at this place. [REVIEW_4] Erika is the sweetest waitress ever. Food is on par with a chain restuarant; but the staff makes it perfect. Thank you! [REVIEW_5] Bad experience in every way! Kept me waiting for no apparent reason; wasn't nice at all and did a terrible job on my brows. Aside from feeling scalped I am also uneven. All this for top dollar. Never again. [REVIEW_6] This is my husband's favorite brunch place. It's hard to get him to go anywhere else! Their yogurt parfait is the absolute best in the city. Their specials are always creative; and on point. Food is consistently delicious. The thing I love most about Ants Pants is the portioning of the food. Some brunch places give you nonsensical portions; and I always feel bad; because I feel like I'm wasting food. Ants Pants gives you very reasonable portions. We always have the same server; and he is super sweet and attentive; even when he's the only one there! [REVIEW_7] One of my favorites in downtown Franklin! Tried a bunch of stuff on the menu but the rusty bucket is always my favorite.  Everything I've ordered has tasted great and been of high quality. I've also always had good service and usually recommend it to folks from out of town! Neat atmosphere; especially when the weather is nice and you can sit outside by the wine bar area! [REVIEW_8] I had not patronized McDonald's in many years as there are many other establishments that actually seem to work for their customers business.

How on earth they can keep the doors open with every customer on site complaining and NO response or concern from staff is simply amazing. [REVIEW_9] The only reason this is great because of Ben the bartender. Very welcoming. I have been in the business. So I see a worker when I see it. He kept the bar stocked with ice beer and smiles. Very pleasant always smiling. GREAT BARTENDER. I will be back just because of Ben. [REVIEW_10] I typically only write reviews for excellent service and like to say I try to see the best in people. However our experience at shelter compelled me to share my experience.  We reserved an hour for bowling to celebrate a birthday.  By the time the hour was up; we had 4 people yet to finish their 10th frame.  This was perfectly fine. I walked over and asked for a 5 minute extension even offering more money for the courteous extension to finish our round.  I was then directed to the bartender who said he would do this; great!  While we waited for our match to come back online; someone came over and told my me and my fiancee to get off our seats because another group was coming. Of course we don't mind moving and sharing space once the other group gets there but there was aggression in his tone.  I assumed this man was just a sour person from the next group; but I later discovered he was actually the owner rudely telling us to move our rear ends.  After several minutes our scores disappeared; and I went to check in on the extra time still thinking this should be a simple fix and in good spirits.  I was told by the person I originally asked that he was too busy and that I should have talked to him when it first happened (this is the same person I initially talked to who redirected me to the bartended) because our scores are gone. He then redirected me to the owner who irritably said you're scores are gone; you can buy another hour if you want.  After I began to become upset; he backtracked and then offered 5 minutes but our scores  were still gone and his tone was still ""get out of my face; I don't care""  I understand mistakes happen and that's not the reason for my negative review.  Customer service was non existent. My entire party felt like a nuisance and not a customer.  The owner should be the pinnacle for customer service; but I have little doubt he is a reason that shelter has a limited lifespan.  It's a shame because it is a beautiful bar.",4
40,"[REVIEW_1] Worst pizza ever- I am originally from NYC so I am aware that I have high standards when it comes to a good slice but I legit thought I was eating cardboard when I ordered a pizza from here. The only thing this place has going for them is their beer garden. [REVIEW_2] I would not recommend using Alexander Bourne or Patina Shoe Parlor for any service. This ""business man"" is not who or what he claims to be. He is not nice; professional; or reliable. I am baffled at this man's success within the local community; all things come to the light eventually.   My personal headache with this I met the ""proprietor"" out last summer; he was a nice enough guy; we had a bunch of mutual acquaintances. When he told me what he did; as shoe junkie I was happy to support a young local business as I too have a young local business; and strongly believe in supporting young entrepreneurs and craftsmen.   Fast forward to January; when I called to have my shoes picked up; as Patinas had transitioned into a mobile service. Alexander came to my house at 8am to pick up my shoes that needed repair; five pairs (4 heels; one pair of flats). He requested I pay upfront; being that it was early in the morning; we had numerous mutual contacts; and he is a young business with hesitation agreed. Thankfully I wrote a check tragically it was for nearly $250. What I was told I was buying was a six pair sole and heel package; the remaining pair I could call in at any time. A receipt would be emailed to me; and my shoes would be done in 10-14 days. 10 days later I call to inquire about my shoes; they are not ready. Day 14; I get voicemail. Day 20 I get hung up on. This persisted. I sent emails; Facebook messages; texts. I get no response.   Eventually I get a weird and vague communication from Alexander's ""assistant"". Nothing is resolved; and then I am blocked from any means of contacting the business and its owner.   In March 3 months later I run into Alexander; we have a hostile and rude exchange. He proceeded to call me a peon and other nasty names; denying having my shoes. In April I see this individual at another event; he laughs as I walk away knowing good and well what is up. Literally as I am prepping to sue this questionable character calls; yep I was that upset he calls and claims there was a mix up; he indeed has my shoes and will drop them off later that day. I give him my work address via a text and email. No response.   He shows up the next morning; doesn't say a word and shows me the 4 heels he has repaired. The work is not bad; I have had much better work done elsewhere without the drama. I inquire about my gold flats; give a description and am told he would look for them; No apology; no explanation given; nothing.   I get an email asking for the shoes to be described; which I find odd considering that I just did this; and that I would get an apology letter later in the day. In my response I suggest a refund; my other shoes found/returned or replaced; only to be answered with ""I never had your flats; and a link to his website. No apology; no receipt.   Funny; he doesn't have my flats like he didn't have my shoes; like he did not remember who I was in March before he decided I was all these terrible random things; and cursed me out.   The lies; deception and utter disregard for customer service and human decency is too much.  I responded professionally requesting a refund; shoes replacement; receipt; and apology. I got zero response.   This whole exchange was really frustrating; and unprofessional. At this point I am out a pair of flats; it's not the end of the world but it is disappointing. It's unfortunate that someone feels entitled to treat others in this fashion; to deceive and steal.  While I am elated that I have my heels back; the reality the work Bourne did was mediocre and his customer service is HORRIBLE! I will chalk this up as a lesson to be careful who I choose to do business with. Research everyone; and do not use Alexander Bourne or Patina Shoe Parlor for ANY  service. You will be disappointed; ripped off and or treated poorly. Just go elsewhere and save yourself the trouble. [REVIEW_3] Very disorganized. My boss called in an order for 5 people at 10:30AM; to be picked up at noon. I went with her to assist carrying the order back to the office. A list of things that went wrong after that: 1 When we arrived at noon; the order was not ready. We were told; however; that it was almost ready and just needed to be bagged. She paid and we waited near the entrance. 2 15 minutes later; with others waiting for lunch at the office; no word on our order. 3  She tried to go back to the register to check on the order; while I went to check to see if our order was in the carry out window. Nothing. Furthermore; the boss was stuck another 5-10 minutes behind a customer demanding a refund.  4 When she finally got to the counter; we found out our order was ready; but no one had bothered to tell the counter that it was ready to go. 5 The order was brought out; looking like food for 5 people was smashed into a bag made for 2 orders.  6 The clerk offered 5 cinnamon rolls for our inconvenience. Fine. However; the rolls ended up being crammed into the bottom of a larger bag with our original order crammed on top.  7 the clerk then darted to the back to get us utensils; which for some bizarre reason took another 5 minutes. He also put in utensils for 25 people into the already full bag. 8 When we finally arrived back at the office; we were treated to one wrong order; room temperature soup and a panini that looked like it had been stepped on.   Yes; it was crowded at lunch there; but that's no excuse for horrendous service and terrible communication; especially for an order that had been called in an hour and a half early.  This Panera location really needs to step up its game. [REVIEW_4] Used to come here while on business to the city. Dive bars are hip. Not this one. This one is just a mess. Bugs; I mean COCKROACHES; crawl along the bar and into people's coats (I overheard). I have seen the roaches and had a few crawl onto my hand. In the men's bathroom there's just a trash bag taped on the wall where a urinal used to be.  I have also overheard that 3 female employees have quit. Which makes it seem like it's not a safe place for ladies.  The bartender I encountered seemed very overwhelmed and perturbed with serving customers that weren't  friends and that weren't doing shots of cheap liquor. Bartender was also playing obnoxious hip hop too loud and denied access to the jukebox that clearly was just paused; not ""broken""; like he poorly tried to explain. I believe ownership or management changed since the last time I visited. Definitely not what it used to be. [REVIEW_5] This is a destination restaurant perfect for a special night out. Its uniqueness makes it a perfect place to impress someone. As a more recent addition to the Bailey's group of restaurants; L'Acadiane is on par with the quality they are well known for.  If you're a fan of New Orleans style or southern food in general; you will love the St. Louis twist they put on the food here. There is just enough kick to it without being overpowering. We tried a bit of everything. The poblano grits were a favorite as well as the roffignac cocktail made with sparkling rosé- a perfect blend between the raspberry and lemon.   Randall; our server was super patient. He realized we were there to take our time; and we did not feel rushed. He did his best to answer questions and cater to allergies. Many of the menu items contain shrimp; but they are well aware this is a problem for many people and can make accommodations.   Give them a try for a southern experience close to home! [REVIEW_6] This is an updated review. I've been ordering from silver mine's at the same location for the last 4-5 years and they have only gotten progressively worse. Don't ask for anything to be added to your soup or chili; they'll charge you for the additions but will not include them in the order. They'll also most likely to include the free side such as the bread. It literally takes at least an hour to get your food delivered; maybe they should call Jimmy Johns and ask the what their secret is. This business is in major trouble with all of the other options available. The service is worse than if you had a bunch of kindergarteners running the business; at least they would be nice. You guys are right next to Eller Business School; why don't you ask them how you can improve??? Currently; this place is an embarrassment to their industry; and a waste of space on University Blvd. NEVER ORDERING FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN. [REVIEW_7] If you are looking to go somewhere where customer service is not a priority; this is your place. Extremely rude and unprofessional waitresses. Every other place on Broadway had accommodating waitstaff. Highly disappointed in the lack of training that seems to be happening in a place that has potential. [REVIEW_8] Well; they get one star for having a really sweet server who was helpful and nice. But seriously; I wish we had just waited in line for an hour at the Pancake Pantry instead. After ordering; we sat for over an hour waiting for our food. When we finally got it; it was awful - my friend's hamburger was stone cold; my biscuits and gravy had congealed after hanging our under a heat lamp or something; and my other friends eggs were lukewarm. No garnishes on the plates; no toast with the eggs; nothing special. We didn't bother to complain because no one wanted to wait another hour for food. I was really disappointed because other people's food had looked really yummy when we were waiting to be seated. Maybe because of the Easter brunch rush? But really; just no excuse for crappy meals. [REVIEW_9] The nachos were seriously disgusting... Probably the grossest food I've had in a long time. The waitress was rude; unresponsive; and had a bad attitude. I will not return. [REVIEW_10] Made reservation a over a week ago with request to be near band. On arrival they had no record of it. And we are stuck in the back next to the bathroom. 5 stars for cocktail;food; band and Atmosphere. 1 stars for utter lack of organization.  The woman who took it said she was new. Always call to confirm I guess. Completely disappointed esp since we've had such amazing experiences here in the past.  There open tables near front and were told they were for people with reservations",1
41,"[REVIEW_1] I had an awful experience at the KOP Makeup Forever Boutique last Friday night. I went there because my esthetician friend told me that it would be the best makeup for my very sensitive; reactive skin. I have a chronic illness and have to take medicine that causes this. She told me that the boutique in King of Prussia was the best place to go for the most knowledgable help. At first; I had a great experience with a nice guy named Christian; who helped me out as I explained my issues and tried two products on me that I ended up purchasing. Low and behold; I broke out terribly after trying to use them for over a week. I packed both products neatly and nicely in the boxes and bag they came in with the receipt and went back to the  King Of Prussia boutique to return them since I could not use them. I was promptly approached by a gal who without really talking or listening to me just grabbed my bag and rudely pulled my receipt out of my bag and smirked while pointing to the return policy at the bottom of the receipt which stated you cannot return any used product. No exchanges or credits either she smugly told me. I had no idea! Was not informed of this policy at all! Would never have purchased skin products with my sensitivities and reactions knowing that I couldn't return something if it didn't work for me and/or might make things worse. I was shocked and felt like I should have been informed of this policy clearly by Christian. I also could not believe how rude and mean the woman was whom I had to deal with my second time in- it was like she seemed to enjoy telling me that I was screwed and enjoyed the look of disappointment on my face. Now I have $80+ worth of product that I will never use/cannot use and a very bad taste in my mouth about Make Up Forever. I am very disappointed with the company and very shocked that this woman that I had to deal with at KOP is able to keep her job. I am going to keep trying to make contact with somebody at Makeup Forever at a higher level and hope for the best. Until then; I would just warn people to stay away from there all together unless you are sure that you know you love what you are purchasing and hopefully you won't have to deal with the mean lady:(. [REVIEW_2] I dont leave reviews but had to as my experience tonight left a really sour taste in my mouth.  Walked in the restaurant to place a take out order for two pho dishes. Paid by card & left a 4$ tip on a 22$ takeout order.   As they gave me the food i asked if i could have hot sauce as well and was told by the young man that thats 1$ extra... i had no cash only card but i was surprised because i was just there yesterday cus my bf is sick and picked up an order with the hot sauce without having to pay anything for it. The older man yesterday was super friendly to me and said if i ever need sauce to just ask so i was baffled that now i had to pay for it. Additionally this is the same sauce that is sitting on the table. I didn't ask for extra sauce! I let the young man know that if he wanted to charge me a $1 to go ahead but i had gotten it for free before to which he replied the rules have changed. And when i said that was yesterday he mumbled and walked away and begrudgingly filled a container for me and as he handed it said next time its a 1$...   Why do i have to pay extra to get the same sauce sitting on the table which i got for free the other day. Secondly i tipped u $4 on takeout. Ive worked in the business. People rarely tip for pickup so you still have the nerve to be a dick... I walked away with the food pissed off that this really just happened. and he had the nerve to yell nothing is free as i was walking away. All this commotion occurred with customers in the store.  Great customer service!   Oh and when i get home only one bag of toppings was provided for two orders; with only 1 lime wedge to be shared by two people...   Sucks as this is the only pho place around and i finally grew to like their pho. Refuse to go back and give my money to that little twerp. [REVIEW_3] It was after July 23 that our ceilings were finally fixed. The maintenance man was very nice; did seem sincere. Stated they needed to hire an outside company to fix it.   Today a valet trash can with diapers and tampons shows up.... The apartment next to me is empty. Perfect timing too; a neighbor left a box with dinner plates today for me and they've gone missing. She meets me outside as I pull up from work and gets to see the trashcan ""of goodies"". Newer neighbor too. No one has called me to apologize for the deplorable conditions. Not even offer an amount off of our rent; Anything at all.   Message me and I will answer any questions based on my experience here.   Also of note; the responses that say that Sheqoia the regional manager will talk to me.... She still hasn't called. There is no value to any resident here from management.  8/7/2015. Still have not talked to tabitha. [REVIEW_4] Not Authentic Indian.. its more like the american chinese restaurants!!! Biggest Pet Peeve was the Biryani.. the rice was undercooked and chicken tasted like it was borrowed from another curry...   Also the server was extremely intrusive. [REVIEW_5] Planet fitness; specifically the one on Murfreesboro Rd in franklin; is fantastic! Being a fitness junkie and having spent many years in every gym known to man; as well as being a personal trainer for about a decade; planet fitness is refreshing. I don't have the same need to go workout for 3 hours a day and stare in the mirror at my progress and compare myself to what I looked like a month ago; and to the other people around me. And Planet Fitness caters to that. It's so clean and well maintained. The staff is super friendly and i truly believe the laid back atmosphere that  encourages you to come do your own thing when it's convenient for you is because of the attitude generated by employees.  The locker rooms are great. Never had a complaint and I LOVE the black card member benefits! [REVIEW_6] Over priced drinks; mixing 4 or 5 different liquors and adding juice should NOT cost 15.00; and its not top shelf liquor either.  2 crab clusters and 2 pieces of corn should NOT cost 25.00! It's a shame since I live right up the street; I keep trying to give this place a chance; but every time I leave disappointed. I'm not even going to speak on the horrible parking. ..this place sucks ass ! [REVIEW_7] At their previous location; I tried Phat Bites. It was dirty and gross. I literally saw the guy mixing a potato salad with his bare hands and then wipe his nose to return to mixing.   Years later; at their new location; I decided to give them another chance. I will concede they said they have a new cook this morning; but my oh my; the food was so bland and undercooked and just overall gross. It's bad enough that the environment is reminiscent of a garage sale turned restaurant - where the items were kept in their original condition by failing to clean them. But on top of that; it's just overall dirty.   Now; the icing on this dirty cake; is that the servers (if you can call them that) are not kind. They are unaware of the menu; they act like it's a burden to help. They need training. One guy was way more concerned with air drumming than attending to my drink order.   It's a bunch of young people; poorly trained; making gross food; in a dirty environment; where they're too cheap to provide real silverware or even a salt shaker. And WAY OVERPRICED. I got to pay $50 for my crap experience.   Seriously; let this place be overtaken by the mold that's likely growing in the corner of the room.   Thank you.   I will never return to this place again. [REVIEW_8] Amazing blow out with Erin.  My hair looked amazing when I left the salon and the next morning looked just as fantastic.  Will be back again! [REVIEW_9] Staff was very nice and helpful but we were extremely disappointed with the food. We ordered Eggplant Parmesan in which tasted like it came out of the frozen section from the grocery store and the spaghetti sauce tasted bitter as if they poured it out of the jar. We were totally disappoint in the food. [REVIEW_10] Fantastic spot to sit down; cool down; and sip the best espresso in Indy. Lots of tables and super friendly and helpful staff. I would come back here again and again and again. I had the Italian macciado. It is very smooth and sweet. Expertly done. Thanks for the great time guys.",3
42,"[REVIEW_1] I ordered the Chicken Carbonara and after getting halfway through my dish; I realized it did not have any ""chicken""???  Instead if apologizing and helping me; both waiters told me the chef had been here for ""30years""???  Does that mean a mistake can't be made?  I did not agree with the lack of empathy nor did I welcome their tone!  You guys need to improve and make sure that you treat your customers with more care.....  I am visiting from Los Angeles; CA and I will surely NOT recommend this business.  Respectfully;  James [REVIEW_2] Good; steady Saturday business but they're a bit slow. They only have one person doing the Pre-wash; and while thorough; it slows up the line.  No military discount; but they do offer one for law enforcement. Nice waiting area with tv; pinball; bowling game; Galaga and...Ms. Pac-Man!!! 5 stars for that!! However; they lose 4 of those stars for shabby work. My rims looked absolutely horrible! Apparently; the car washing gauntlet does not reach the wheels/rims. Additionally; they completely failed to wipe any of the brake dust from any of the 4 rims. I called one of the attendants to re-do the rims but the 2nd go round wasn't much more remarkable.  For the $25 ""St. Charles"" wash; I'd like my rims to be washed and shining!  Do not EVER go here for your auto needs. [REVIEW_3] I don't know why this place has 2.5 stars so far; it was really really good; we got some sort of shrimp pasta with cream sauce and it was out of this world.  The waiter made me a drink that wasn't on the menu; Caesar salad was amazing; bread yum.  Who could complain? Nice decor; never been to one before. [REVIEW_4] We were looking forward to trying out this newly redone restaurant. The atmosphere is fresh and well done . We were there for breakfast. They now have table service. Things were great until the food came out. My pancakes tasted like stale bread.  My wife's eggs were cold. The potatoes were not cooked. They brought the wrong side dishes. For silverware; we were given  forks but no knives. It took a while to find a waiter to get the silverware we needed. We did speak to the manager. She offered a discount of $2.50  not that we were looking one; but why bother?). However; she did not remove the extra charge for the incorrect side dish we didn't order ($4.00).  She did apologize for the food verbally but somehow we were made to feel like she couldn't care less. I don't write many reviews unless I really love something or dislike something. This restaurant fits into the latter category. Sorry. A nice decor is not enough. [REVIEW_5] This spa delivers. The atmosphere here is PERFECT. Calming and fancy--I felt like a princess there. It's very clean and the masseuses are quite good. Just make sure to speak up if they start pushing too hard during a massage! It's so tranquil there. I want to go back one day! [REVIEW_6] This has quickly become one of my favorite places to eat! My friend and I have been here twice already and I've never left feeling disappointed. I recommend just about everything they have on the raw list and then on the medium plates the mama dumplings are a must! What also makes this place great in my book is that the service is amazing. [REVIEW_7] This place is awesome! Best selection around; super friendly and knowledgeable staff and very reasonable prices. The bar is really nice and with 30 beers on tap (always 2 on nitro!) you can't beat it. Definitely the best craft beer store you will find in philly! [REVIEW_8] We expected so much more from an SPG Hotel. We stayed at the Aloft because we were in town for a funeral and we are SPG preferred members. However.....this hotel left a lot to be desired.   We paid in advance online and arrived late in the evening to check-in; the parking lot was packed; we drove around for quite some time to find a space and then walked a short distance to the front doors of the hotel and the lobby was packed! Music playing; people seated at the bar; playing pool and just sort-of hanging out. We were extremely exhausted after driving in from New Jersey. After attending a funeral; repass at the church and then again at the home of the family; it was quite a long day and we were a bit hungry and tired.     We checked in; paid $10.00 for parking (which I'll talk more about shortly) and asked if they had room service; which they do not and we were given a menu of a place that delivered. We took the elevator to our floor and as soon as we stepped off the elevator we were greeted with dog poop on the floor. As we walked down the hall to our room; we were greeted with the smell of weed; pot; Mary Jane; marijuana or whatever you want to call it. We got into our room and called the front desk and advised them of the dog poop and then placed an order with Femi's pizza for delivery.   My boyfriend then went down to the hotel bar to grab a drink; as he sat down at the bar there was a woman and man seated beside him and he could hear their entire conversation; the young woman was telling the gentleman her cost for SERVICES; yes; those services! My boyfriend took a few sips of his drink and got up to come back to our room; he was then approached by THREE women who asked him if they could go back to his room with him; he said no thank you; and that he had a girlfriend upstairs that he was going back to; and they said; ""too bad; you could have had some fun tonight""   Once back safely our room the food delivery called to say that the hotel would not let me up and that we needed to come down to pick up our food. We ate and went right to sleep. The next morning we woke to the sounds of planes departing and arriving; we showered; dressed and checked out of the hotel.   As I mentioned earlier; I would tell you about parking. We paid the additional $10.00 for parking as parking was not included. We got to the gate to slide in our paid parking pass and the gate was GONE; their was nothing there and we just drove away and headed back to New Jersey.   The hotel and rooms are quite trendy; the shower was nice and the complimentary body wash and 2 in1 shampoo and conditioner were nice. However; there was a bit of a sour smell coming from the drain; the bed was pretty basic; I would not want to sleep on it more that one night. The wall unit a/c turned on and off all night; I tried to adjust the temp on the unit itself and it would not adjust. I noticed the thermostat on the wall and tried adjusting it and it did not work either; so I just unplugged the unit.    Whenever we go back to Philadelphia; we will not stay at the Aloft and I do not recommend it. [REVIEW_9] I was just there last night. Awesome Italian restaurant. You are welcomed by the owner when you walk in who is very friendly and wants to ensure you are enjoying the meal and service. I can tell that the customer is extremely important to her and it shows as there is a decent wait; but it is worth it. This is my go to place for Italian food. Prices are reasonable and the plates plentiful. I typically get penne vodka with chicken. Their penne vodka sauce is second to none. What separates them from others is the apps are great; filling and just as much detail goes in the creation as their main dishes. Combine all this with BYOB and you can't go wrong. I never have room for dessert; maybe one day. If you want a consistent; reliable Italian restaurant this is it. [REVIEW_10] Great food!  Service was super nice: George!  Crab cakes were awesome.  Just a great place to eat!",6
43,"[REVIEW_1] Food is good.  Decor is nice.   Service was terrible.  Our drink orders were not what we ordered.  Rather than tell us they don't carry certain items;  they made up their own drinks.  It was terribly disappointing. [REVIEW_2] Been coming here for years and love it. The owner Ken is a riot and always fun to hang around with. Food is good as usual and they serve a good late night crown. A lot of the seafood is fresh; as you can see them fetching it from the live tanks after you order!  Overall; great place. Perfect for parties and get togethers! [REVIEW_3] I purchased a $199 Groupon for ZOOM! whitening at Patelka Dental. Before I purchased my Groupon I called Patelka to confirm it was the full ZOOM! process. The women confirmed that yes; it is ZOOM! and it was the full 4-15 minute sessions. I purchased my Groupon and called back and made my apt.   The day before my apt. I get a call from Patelka telling me they need to move my appointment until the follow week as they didn't have anyone in the office that day to perform the ZOOM!; I ask to have an apt the day before and she explains that they are booked solid with ZOOM! apts. About an hour later I get another call back saying they are able to fit me in; AWESOME! I take a half day off work so I can make the new appointment time. I get yet another call back saying they have to cancel my new appointment because they do not have enough supplies to accommodate me. I question how they do not have the supplies for me if they just booked my appointment? The lady quickly notes that they do not do ZOOM! that they do Lumebrite. ( NOT WHAT I PURCHASED or what I was told earlier ) I explain to her that my Groupon is for ZOOM! not Lumebrite. I ask for a refund. She refuses to bring me in for the ZOOM! that and refuses to refund me. I ask to speak with a manager or owner; (who is unable to come to the phone ) So I ask that she call me back asap as my appointment is for the following day and i took off work. The woman on the phone tells me I can expect a call tomorrow. When I receive my call from the manager (Natalie) She is RUDE; disrespectful; and I could not get a word in edge wise.   Thank goodness Groupon refunded me promptly and politely. I have never had worse customer service. I would never trust these people with my teeth. Save your money and your time. IT IS A SCAM!  I would never recommend them to anyone. [REVIEW_4] Very poor customer service. We live in neighborhood and have been numerous times. This time we were on Yelp and looking for somewhere to pick up lunch. Decided to do Tampa Pizza Company since we hadn't gotten it in a while. Unfortunately chose to use the EatStreet Yelp online ordering option.  Huge mistake. Order placed; got confirmation and credit card was charged. Went over to pick up food 20 Minutes later as requested and they said they didn't get the order. They stated they don't accept Yelp/EatStreet orders online anymore. Never bothered to call us and say they actually canceled the Yelp order on us. They told us we should just re-order and pay again in the restaurant and wait another 20 minutes for it to be prepared and get a refund from EatStreet! Won't be going back with this poor customer service. Manager was even there and not helpful at all. No wonder why it was totally dead inside the place even while the Sunday market was going on right outside. [REVIEW_5] They have the WORST service advisors! Used to be good before Kelly and her team left. Unfortunately; it's convenient to work if I need oil change before I can make it to another Honda dealer. [REVIEW_6] Not Authentic Indian.. its more like the american chinese restaurants!!! Biggest Pet Peeve was the Biryani.. the rice was undercooked and chicken tasted like it was borrowed from another curry...   Also the server was extremely intrusive. [REVIEW_7] I took my expensive Christian Louboutins here to be dyed since I had heard that this place was one of the best in the city. Boy; what an overstatement. I wanted my studded gray CLs dyed black. I SPECIFICALLY told them to please; please; please be careful not to get any dye on the red soles because that is what makes a Louboutin a Louboutin. I also asked if they could dye it without covering the studs. They told me YES. They would tape off everything that wasn't going to be dyed and it would turn out perfect. I came back a week later; like they told me. Only 1 shoe was half done. So they told me another week.  I came in to pick them up today to find the worst dye job I have ever seen in my life. There was black dye all over the studs; all over the inside and the toe box; and (worst of all) all over the red soles. Besides the damage; all of the gray had not even been dyed. There were random un-dyed patches everywhere. I told them that this was not the kind of work I was promised. Then they changed their story and said that it would have been impossible to tape off the studs. They said I should not have even tried to get them dyed. When I questioned why there is dye on the inside and why the red soles are covered in black dye splotches; they said ""I don't know"". They told me they could TRY to remove the dye but that the red might come off; too. I told them this is completely unacceptable. And then they gave me an attitude. They said ""Look; we already told you we could remove the dye. I don't understand why you keep standing here talking.""  If the job could not be done; they should have told me ahead of time. I understand it was a tedious job; what with all the studs; but there is no excuse for getting dye all over the inside and soles. He said the dye would come off as I walked. ....YOU DON'T WALK ON THE ARCHES OF THE HEELS. I asked for my money back and they told me they dyed my shoes like I asked; so what more do I want. I just took my shoes and left. They must be crazy to think I would leave my shoes there for them to ""fix"".  I instead took them to Superior Shoe Repair near 15th and Walnut. I have taken shoes there before; so I should've went there to begin with because I know they are used to dealing with designer shoes. They said they could fix it; so I will be reviewing them when I pick them up this week. [REVIEW_8] First time trying this place.  I'll be back for sure.  Everything ordered was very good!  I think it'll be my next stand by; go to place for an inexpensive; good and tasty meal [REVIEW_9] We ate here for supper based on the reviews. I got the stuffed flounder which was delicious.  My husband got the feast which was crab legs; shrimp; and mussels. It was also flavorful and yummy. As a bonus kids eat free on Tuesdays. We also had wonderful service. [REVIEW_10] Unprofessional manager; that manager I spoke to was not listening to me at all.  He would talk as fast as he could and would not let me say what I call for; every time I say something he would start talking and keep talking just running all over my words; neither of us listening to each other; only escalated voice tones. It was not worth the 10% which was about $20.00; I would save by using my government issued veterans id card but because of some verbiage that was not on the ID; Home Depot decline the discount.  The cashier interrogated me took my ID looked at it then at me and said I could not use the Id; I never had a problem before.  She stop talking and stood there waiting for my money.  The manager did not want to hear me out and the check out person were  both very disrespectful and rude.",3
44,[REVIEW_1] LOVE. This tiny place is consistent & personal. The staff is always prompt & very helpful. The quality & pride in food is my favorite part. They are definitely accomedating if you have any preferences. I had only two places I would eat sushi at while pregnant (sparingly) - this was one of them. The out door seating is a massive bonus on a nice day! [REVIEW_2] I can't recall the day I went but it was a memorial resturant experience.  I was greeted by an incredibly nice cashier. After a hard decision I ordered a Devils delight and the girl giggled ( of course I was confused) She explained it was Dev's Delight and named after her because it was her idea for a burger and me calling it Devils delight was a bit funny because her friends call her Devil Dev ( hard to believe such a nice girl could aquire such a nickname but cute). After she took my thorough of a medium burger; and truffle fires i didn't have to wait very long. Even before I ate the burger the smell it self had my mouth watering.  The burger was cooked to perfection and what was on the burger was amazing!  This burger was a standard beef foundation with mozzarella cheese tomato basil and a portobello mushroom; what great idea for a burger! For a mushroom lover this with a side of the delicious truffle fries is perfect. Excellent quality and service;  a bit expensive but worth every penny. No question about it I will be a return customer! [REVIEW_3] We brought our dog care for an emergency several weeks ago. Sadly our dog passed away but the vet stuff was so good and compassionate and did all the could. They were quick to treat her when we arrived and to do all needed tests to determine the problem. They were very knowledgeable in helping us make a decision as to what was best for our dog. We really liked the vet to the point that we asked if she sees regular visits and were bummed to find out she only sees emergencies. The team sent us a card and nice note after the loss of our dog. The cost was reasonable and actually less than I expected. Would definitely come back again. [REVIEW_4] Absolutely loved everything we ordered! We started with the bread board and it was delicious. I ordered the bacon egg and cheese on a croissant! They're croissants are to die for  we ordered a few different coffees and they were great! Mimosa was average. [REVIEW_5] If i could give it no stars i would.Worst television  service ever!!! I warn you not to go though with direct t.v! I have had problems with them over charging me since the moment I signed up with them. They even sent me to collections for att Wifi service that I didn't even have!!!!! I would stick with Charter Cable! They are wayyyyy better! [REVIEW_6] Horrible service!  There for an hour and a half and never got food. Six tables seated after us got fed and left. Our server said he didn't know what happened. When I asked to speak to the manager I was told he was cooking in the kitchen. We finally walked out. [REVIEW_7] I've driven by this place many many times; thinking nothing of it. But last night I had a stung craving for pizza. Not just pizza but I wanted the big; thin; NY style pizza. So after reading these yelp reviews I decided to call this am for lunch delivery.   AMAZING. The Alfredo's special is amazing with lots of fresh veggies; along with meat and pepperoni. The large will feed us for many days! And the soup was amazing - the steak and potato - it was ALL steak and potato - so chunky and delicious.  Also I wanted to say - when I called in for delivery - they couldn't have been NICER on the phone. When I've called in to other places; they usually talk real fast and can't wait to drop you before finishing your order. Not at Alfredos! Great service and delivery was uber fast too! Within 30 mins; I had my meal for the family.  This is going to be our new dedicated Pizza place for sure! Thanks yelpers for your great reviews! [REVIEW_8] This is the best tea shop I've been to hands down! The tea and the atmosphere are great and I LOVE the people there. They are all extremely helpful and knowledgeable about their product. I always look forward to trying the new kinds of teas they get in. I'll definitely my go to spot! [REVIEW_9] I love having this store right here in the city. All I wear is Indique hair and to have this store so close is what I need! The ladies are very helpful in helping to choose hair although I always stick with my norm. The customer service here is on point and I will continue to utilize the service! Thanks Indique!!! [REVIEW_10] This studio has one of the best yoga teachers in Arizona as a primary instructor - Lisa Schrempp.  It is a great studio for those who like a strong; sweaty Ashtanga-inspired practice.  It's a great alternative to the Anusara studios in town; where there's too much talking and not enough practicing.   Yoga flow has a great Mysore program (with Jois-certified Lisa Schrempp); which is fantastic (that's my personal practice).  The other classes and instructors are all great as well - I would recommend this studio to anyone; at any level.  There are great beginner classes as well.,8
45,"[REVIEW_1] This has fast become one of my favorite New Orleans gems! Enter over at the bridge on Peters near Elysian Fields or a little way up on Piety; either way; if you like breezes and city views; your efforts will be rewarded. The path stretches about a 1.25 miles from close to Elysian Fields over to the area near the old Navy installation. Along the way are various art installations; a dog park; and a wonderful walk along the mighty Mississippi River. If you time it just right; you might catch one of the spectacular sunsets. A beautiful way to end any day in NOLA! [REVIEW_2] I had a great experience last oil change. It was back in September but it was great! The techs were friendly and efficient! They sent a letter thanking me for coming in and included a $10 coupon! I will definitely be back! [REVIEW_3] Finally open; The Livery makes use of the former IPD Horse Livery and is the newest endeavor by the Cunningham Group- the masterminds who brought Mesh; Bru Burger and Union 50 to the Mass Ave area.   Livery features an extensive tequila menu in both of their bars. Yeah; I said two bars. One downstairs and another one upstairs that overlooks a patio that's going to be pretty nice this coming spring.   Menu features small plates..  ceviche; yuca fries and jamon serrano top the appetizers with octopus; choripan and skirt steak make up the more substantial (and higher price point) items.   For my meal I went with the Livery Margarita ($9) made with maestro dobel diamante; Lazaroi triplo; fresh lime juice and agave. Add some salt to the rim and this was pretty tasty!  I also went with the roaster vegetables with chimichuri. A nice and somewhat healthy way to dine.   Valet parking is a must around here unless you happen to be lucky enough to score a parking spot out front or on Mass Ave. if walking; the door is on the north side of the building back a bit.   So happy to be neighbors with this place. My VIP card is going to get a [REVIEW_4] Mummy's Day off was a great service! I called and spoke to a gentlemen and then ultimately to Angela. Memorial Day Weekend; we had 2 energetic 8 year olds; and a house with a big yard and pool.We were on a wine tour so this was an 8 hour sitting job. She arranged for a sitter that was perfect for the kids. Johanna. She swam with them and played games. The first thing my son said was ""best sitter ever"". He doesn't really get left with a sitter often so he was a little apprehensive; she made him feel at home and they had a great time. Johanna also watched our dog! Angela finds you the perfect sitter to meet all of your needs!   Great service; great result! [REVIEW_5] We had a group of 11; we couldn't sit together because they do not accommodate for larger groups. We had to wait many times for our waitress to come back to fill drinks. Our food at the table of 5 came out 30 minutes before the food for the group of 6 even got their salad.  Our waitress never took our empty plates; which compiled a mess. Usually happy with Texas Roadhouse but this experience will make me think twice before coming back. [REVIEW_6] I've been going to Rev regularly since it opened; and it just keeps getting better. They'd added new items to the food menu; and there's now a full list of classic & more exotic tiki drinks in the tiki bar out back. I've been to quite a few tiki bars across the country (it's a hobby); and I can honestly say Rev is still one of my favorites. Classic; kitchy decor; great music; super chill; and the drinks are on point. They have hundreds of tequilas if you're not into mixed drinks and the food is reliably delicious. I usually go for the potato or pork tacos. Try the dirty deeds hot sauce. [REVIEW_7] As the man at the front desk just told me; check-in ""begins at 3; that doesn't mean a room will be available.""  But we can check our bags for a fee and have a drink at the bar (not complimentary) while we wait. Right now the lobby is crammed full of people waiting for them to get their rooms available for check-in.     This is a pretty lobby; but I'd rather be in the room they promised me. As I'm sure would all the other folks who are waiting.   Won't stay here again. Not sure we are staying for the night. [REVIEW_8] Both the woman who did my pedicure and the woman who did my massage where very nice; but for the price I paid for each it was not worth it!  The pedicure was $50 and it's equal to an express pedicure at other salons. Very disappointing. The massage was ok. But I would never ever return:( [REVIEW_9] This is what we came to New Orleans for.. Came in and heard the oldies but goodies Isley Brothers Cover. Lots of folks dancing and having fun. The bartender's are gorgeous and were helpful in letting us know the highlights of the bar. We had fun on the balcony. The drink specials were dope and I guess the drinks were nice and stiff according to my lady and her brother (I don't drink ) [REVIEW_10] The friendly staff really make this hotel a pleasure to stay in!",7
46,"[REVIEW_1] I didn't enjoy my experience at Clayton nails today 7/3/2015. It was all because of the nail tech; i didn't get her name but she was young; Vietnamese with a med length bob haircut. I went in for a gel color polish change. Her work is not as neat as what im use to there. She for some reason placed two scolding hot towels over each of my hands while removing the old color. I told her that the towels were too hot and she than removed them and swung them in the air to cool off than reapplied. She than asked 'is this better princess "".  Than she turned around and ask if that woke me up. I've had a gel polish color change several times before; no one has ever placed hot towels on my hands EVER;  i don't know why she did. After the gel color polish was applied and dry she repeatedly reapplied a top thick coat over and over. I kept having to place my hands under the uv light again; thats never happened before either. I guess i have to pick one person to go to and stick to them religiously. [REVIEW_2] half-price margarita pitchers on tuesday. i'm so there. the mahi mahi taco is calling my name. [REVIEW_3] Abysmal customer service. Came in on Wednesday at 6ish (not busy); ordered a meatball sub from some short white dude. He insisted that meatball subs only get three meatballs and when I challenged him and inquired as to why that was he got very rude very quickly. As my sub was in the oven I decided to look up subway's website and; lo and behold; meatball subs DO get four meatballs; just like every other time I have gotten a sub from that store. When I informed him of this and asked for another meatball he stomped over; smashed two more meatballs into my sandwich; and snippily finished the order even after I informed him I didn't want to cause any trouble.  There are some wonderful people who work at this Subway. That guy was not one of them and the experience was enough to put me off that store completely. I'm not expecting five star service from a Subway but when you try to take advantage of your customers and then get angry when they call you out on it; maybe you aren't meant for a job that involves customer interaction. Will not be returning to this store ever again. [REVIEW_4] I tried to like this place... I really did. So much so that I went back to try it after a less that satisfactory first wax.  Wax 1- I had Despina; I think her name was. I waited a good 15 minutes after my appointment time for her to come and get me from the front. Ironic they have a 9 minute policy that if you don't show they'll cancel/charge you or whatever. Anyway; as for the experience with Despina; she did not speak to me. Like at all. Made me feel super awkward the whole time; and missed a fair few chunks of hair. She didn't ask me anything about myself; didn't tell me where to sit or how she wanted me positioned etc. Luckily I got this one half price as it was my first time at EWC.  Wax 2- I booked 3-4 weeks later with Amy Jo (based on previous Yelp reviews). She was a lot friendlier (literally the only reason why I'm giving this 1 star) BUT way too sloppy. I think it's safe to say this is the worst wax I've ever had. She left half of my hair on right before Valentine's Day! I understand they can't get all the hairs all the time but a lottttt of hair right on top was left clearly visible to my waxer. My apt was at 3.45; I walked out of the building at 3.53. Really. This includes the time spent undressing; redressing; and paying. 8 minutes is not long enough for all of this. It went so quick that when she said she was done I was actually shocked.   I'm about to go to CVS and get some at home wax strips to finish the job... For $47+ I expect way way more.   The staff- Another reason why I won't be returning. The ladies at the front desk are generally rude and disinterested in showing any glimpse of good customer service. ALSO; I don't like being asked if I'm going to tip - can't you give me the card machine so I can do it myself rather than make me announce if I would like to tip and how much?   The hunt for a decent Brazilian wax in Philly continues- someone help me PLEASE! [REVIEW_5] I'm only giving this place a one star for the convenience since it was next to my hotel.  I should have either saved my money or eaten at the gas station down the street!  I ordered the Asparagus soup with crab meat; green beans; and chicken salad wrap.  Well I couldn't even swallow one taste of the soup; yes I had to spit the mystery goo out. Tasted spoiled!!  The chicken salad had no flavor at all and was very dry. As I picked through it I found a lot fat. A total waste of money. The food ruined my appetite!! [REVIEW_6] Came in on a Friday and the food and service was terrific. I had the cod fish special with carrots. The cobbler desert was amazing.   The interior is nice and the chairs are also super comfortable. This is my new favorite place! [REVIEW_7] Great service; large portion size and reasonable prices. My new favorite place to go for dinner. We will definitely return. [REVIEW_8] Been to MOD pizza once and the experience was something to remember. We went around lunch time and the service was great. I love how you can choose what toppings you want and the good guys at MOD pizza bake to order. Defiantly will be returning in the near future to MOD Pizza! [REVIEW_9] Everything about our visit was fantastic - delicious food; colorful decor; and excellent service! [REVIEW_10] Wow new ownership and they don't care about customers that's for sure.dont go here for lunch or if you are in a hurry. I think this location won't last long with the attitude they have here ...",5
47,"[REVIEW_1] This is our first time here. I had to write this review before we left because I do not want to forget how wonderful the food is. Kayla; our server; was pleasant; informative; and extremely knowledgeable about the food.  We had the Goat Cheese Stuffed Squash Blossoms for an appetizer; the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp ""En Cocotte"" or Shrimp and Grits; and Croque-Madame for our meal.   The appetizer was a fantastic mix of tangy and slightly sweet using all Louisiana ingredients. The shrimp and grits were the best I have ever had; my absolute favorite. The croque-Madame was a perfect mix of ham; cheese; and egg. Melt in your mouth Chisesi ham.   If you are in town for a day or you live here; I highly suggest stopping in for a meal. This restaurant is now on our top list of must visit again places. [REVIEW_2] Appointment for an oil change was easy to make; I was greeted promptly upon arrival; they got my vehicle right in (as they should since I had an appointment); and I was out of there in 1 hour.  I bought my vehicle here; and they have been nothing but great every time I needed service. Excellent dealership! Considering the 5 year warranty and excellent service; I will continue buying Kia Sorrentos. [REVIEW_3] I reserved a full sized car. When I arrived at my scheduled time; they had none. The salesman sold me on accepting a Kia Soul; he told me it was the equivalent of full sized vehicle. When I got home; knowing nothing about this vehicle; I did some research. It is classified as a sub compact. So Enterprise took my full payment for a full sized vehicle and completely screwed me. I don't have time to go back to the rental office; so I am stuck paying full price for a sub compact; and I have to use this vehicle for a 1400 mile trip. Never again will I use this rental agency. Don't be like me; do better research and be prepared when they try to screw you over! [REVIEW_4] I brought a party of 4 to dinner at 6. After sitting for 15 minutes seeking waitstaff; we waited an interminable amount of time (40) minutes for a couple of salads. The appetizers were served with filthy dish-ware with food particles from the prior customer. The salads were less than delightfulwith crushed avacado slices thrown into the bowl as an afterthought. Needless to say the experience was eminently less than satisfactory. I will not ever return. [REVIEW_5] Took the youth group out for a fun night..definitely won't return.    Everything was gross.   Tables were unclean.   Told that food would be done in 30 minutes.   Definitely took almost an hour.   Balls were nasty.  Seriously.  Everything about this place is disgusting.  The chairs are all tore up.   The mini golf needs to be updated.  I went up to ask about about bumpers (we were playing crazy bowl) they refused.  Said that we were too old.  I have 11-13 year olds.  The two lanes next to us had bumpers up and plenty of adults in their 30-40's but because they had 1-2 kids the were allowed to have the bumpers up.   Seriously.  We will never be back.  None of the kids want to come here any more.  Swing around fun town it is.  The icing on the cake was the ""help"" at the front desk.  All 5 guys were just sitting around.  One guy checked us out but had to be a real jerk.  My husband went up to buy 7 mini golfs..one of the workers said ""you gonna pay for that?""  Seriously? [REVIEW_6] this place was awful. the first time my mother and I went we were very excited because everyone had been talking about it and we want to support local business. The day we went it happened to be pouring raining. So we are standing there at the hostess stand cold and wet waiting to be seated. Not only was the hostess not there; no one even acknowledged that we were there. The bartender who was right next to he stand was on his blue tooth and only looked our way to flirt with me. My mom was so annoyed we just left.   The second time we went was because we were going to be in the area and we decided to give it a second try. We were seated right away and the music was really good. The waiter could have cared less about our table. he acted like we were doing him a favor by even coming to the table. The menu was thin and nothing to really choose from. when he eventually brought the food it was decent. My mom hated her salmon cakes because they were overly breaded and poorly season. it honestly looked like two pieces of bread.   It was overpriced for what we had. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. The take out makes great dog food though. [REVIEW_7] Gave this store one star only because I had to in order to post a review. Went here last week to get a new phone. Service was indifferent to say the least. Staff was condescending and barely polite. Not a good experience. [REVIEW_8] This bakery is amazing; from the decor to the quality of the service.  Come to the frosted fox for friendky service from thr owners and then try one of their delicious desserts.  the prices are incredibly reasonable. The biggest problem is figuring out what you want to order. I recommend the giant snicker doodle cookie or the m&m cookie. Both were amazing and you really can't go wrong! [REVIEW_9] As another reviewer pointed out the pork chop entree is pretty amazing. Actually probably one of the best I have had ANYWHERE that I've been. Everything on the plate tastes good and it all goes together perfectly. I will be going back just to get that every time probably. I want to try something else but the pork chop entree is so good not sure I even care to. Had the corn bread for an appetizer. It was pretty good and the apple butter that came with it was delicious. Can't wait to go back. [REVIEW_10] I care that much for doughnuts but these are pretty amazing. Their bacon maple one is incredible and worth trying. Also their sliders are equally great. I've had their cheeseburger one and chicken caesar and would get them again",5
48,[REVIEW_1] Fabulous! Best happy hour; fresh menu; Delish- drinks; if I had the time; I'd come here every day! [REVIEW_2] Horrible dining experience. Waitress was terribly slow. Messed up drink order. Had no artichoke and spinach dip; reason was it has been a busy week yet it was only Monday. Ordered the chicken club and only half the sandwich had chicken on it. When we told the waitress she shrugged her shoulders and didnt seem to really care.  Took forever for her to return and offer another drink. Took forever for the food also. Will not be returning here. [REVIEW_3] RIPPED OFF!!!!  Total slime balls!!  Note: there are no prices listed on the truck.  (At least not during the 2nd Street Festival in NoLibs.)  My friend went there and ordered the fried chicken platter with an extra side of yams.  The guy working there told him it would be $14 for the platter and $2 for the side.  He said ok; I'll be right back and left to go pick something up really quickly.  He comes back to pick up the food and forks over a $20 bill for he order.  They take it and he asks for his change.  (Should be $4.)  Instead of giving him his change back; they tell him it is $20 - $16 for the platter and $4 for the side.  (Sudden price increase?!?!)  My friend argues with them briefly and tells him that isn't what they agreed to before and he just wants the change.  The guy refuses so my friend leaves; having paid an extra $4.  Bottom line: don't eat here!  They're dishonest and completely rude.  Oh; and on top of that; the food was bland.  Spent $20 for bland food.  Shame.  (No; my opinion about the food wasn't biased by his experience.  He told me after we ate so I would still enjoy my food and not go out and tear them a new one.) [REVIEW_4] This place is Smokey and insane...8 dollars for a drink at center bar ; even if your playing the bar-top machines?? I know its not Vegas but come on; some tickets/vouchers I had from a month ago with money on the expired?? Why is that?? Even the stupid slots would not take em?? I had to go to meet a friend who spends a lot there; I was coughing my brains out from the smoke. I was stressed the whole time I was there;  as was my wife; it used to be fun; now it sucks.We eat at some of the restaurants weekly ; but we are done. Now they want to re-do the lot and charge to park ; what the hell is wrong with these greedy Indians or whoever is running this scam.Talk about driving people away; I know they don't care because its always packed house; the clientèle however has dropped to thugs and lowlifes. The parking garage is nasty like New Jersey...garbage all over;  stinks; gum on the ground; just shit. Now should I tell you what I really think?? [REVIEW_5] Stay away from this dealership.  I have wrote about 3 different reviews on their site and I keep giving them one more chance but wont anymore.  My whole family drives Hyundai but constantly they find ways to screw you over. [REVIEW_6] Will never shop here again!!! My best friend is getting married and I went in to find a bridesmaid dress. The staff wasn't super helpful and I got ignored until I went up and ask someone for help and told her what color of dress I was looking for. They said they didn't have any in stock but they could order a dress and it would be here in a week. So I sat down went through the style book and picked out the style of dresses I liked. The employ told me to leave my name and number and the manager would text me pictures of dresses with the prices that night. I never received a text or phone call from them. So about a week and a half later I called and asked them what was going on. The lady who answered the phone said she would leave a message and they would again call me back that night and get everything figured out. Let's just say it's been 3 weeks and I still haven't heard a word. The wedding is now in 2 weeks and luckily I was able to find a dress else where. [REVIEW_7] Walked in; excited to try the burger and tots. Small place but; 3 tables open. We sat down and were ignored Until mgr came over to ask if our name was on the waiting list; we said we passed the hostess and she didnt asked us for our name for waiting list. He said people were waiting; meanwhile; no visable people in cue to sit! He told us to get up and wait in a corner near the bar! We left! We had just been in a large group who dropped $$$$ on drinks; snacks at the sister restaurant Tinto next door too. Rude! [REVIEW_8] We ordered delivery because I'm sick at home. For $12 carnitas that was supposed to come with cilantro; onion and salsa; non of these was included. they came with only a little bit of meat in two taco shells and tasted unseasoned. My pork shoulder was very chewy and was supposed to come with pickles but didn't.  The beans; potato salad; and coleslaw were all filled less than half way. Only good things are the toasts. We will not order from this place ever again. [REVIEW_9] Good reviews are quite often written by employees to bring in the mass. Unfortunately; true statement and situations; such as mine; are never told due to that unsatisfied and upset customers just prefer to move on and forget their horrific visit. This location needs to greatly improve on food quality. I expressed my opinions to their Corp office and they said that they  would refund (me on a specific day when I received bad food) if I gave them a credit card # over phone or email. I paid cash! Why cc #?! Makes you say hummm! Then after several attempts to get my last visit refunded they finally offered a gift certificate which would be mailed to me. Did I get it you ask?...why; no; of coarse not. All in all; Pita J needs to go away. Liars put a bad taste in anyone's mouth. PJ - your food is sub-par at best. Too many options in area. Go elsewhere. [REVIEW_10] This place is a dirty hole.  Avoid it. They have unfriendly service; crappy beer selection and they have no problems over serving the already inebriated customers.   There is such a seedy element to this place.   In the span of 4 days; 2 men were attacked on the sidewalk after closing time.   I have nothing against guys smoking weed; but the gauntlet of smokers that you have to wade through to get in or out of the bar is just gross.  Ever notice how it's impossible to get a taxi to come to this bar?,1
49,"[REVIEW_1] Would never come back to this Quiznos again. We showed up at 10:50am on Sunday and sign says doesn't open till 11am; which i can respect so I waited in my car till 11am and then I go to the door and the lights are still out and it appears that an employee had just arrived and she is giving my wife and I the one minute signal through the window. We stand outside and wait; mind you it's winter and cold. We wait a couple minutes outside and then a second employee arrived and says to us ""it's not open yet""? The  employee inside lets the other one in and proceeds to tell us to wait longer in which it is 11:05 at this time and none of the veggies and sandwich meat had been out so we decided to go somewhere else. They could have at least allowed us to wait inside. Clearly punctuality is not important to the employees of this store. [REVIEW_2] Was thrilled with our toast being served hot. Few places manage to do that. However very uncomfortable booths. Bad parking lot. Not enough spots. So no reason to return. [REVIEW_3] The only reason for one star is it is the only way the review would post. We had long ago decided not to return to the Avon location after three disappointing visits. We frequented the Lafayette location often and were very disappointed in the service and quality of the Avon location where we now reside.  Tonight we followed our daughter and her family to the Avon location (unaware of where they had decided to go for dinner). This evening topped  the list of terrible restaurant experiences-over an hour wait for food; my daughters steak was cooked well done when ordered medium rare; the steak was remade which had to be boxed and was left at the table because was still cooked incorrectly.  She was charged 9.99 for the remake and that is what was taken off her bill not the price of the original steak&rib dinner.  I ordered the apple pie desert with ice cream which came out before we even received our drinks and without a spoon.  My husband drove back to the location where the manager refused to do anything different about the original charge for the incorrectly cooked steak; needless to say my husband left with the owners phone number.  Mistakes happen - but own them; every bad experience is related to over 20 people; who then in turn; repeat to someone else - so tell me manager of Avon; IN Texas Roadhouse - was it worth it? [REVIEW_4] Stopped in here with my wife and a friend for lunch today. And let me tell you it will probably be the last time I visit this location.  I normally love QDOBA but this location down right sucks. From the ride ass customer service to the cleanliness it's just all around terrible. I've never had a person whistle at me from behind a ""line"" and say ""excuse me what would you like to eat"". You're kidding me right?  And plus look at my pics; this chick had her hair dangling down in front of her face and swaying back in forth and prepping food. ARE YOU SERIOUS? What happened to having it covered up? I won't be back to this location; to easy to get sick or catch something. [REVIEW_5] Went to this store to get a passport sent to England A.S.A.P (which weighs next to nothing); they told me it would be $110 for 4 day delivery with no guarantee that it would arrive by then. I went to Fed Ex who told me they could do it for $57 with a 2 day guarantee. Shop around before using UPS!!! [REVIEW_6] Nice food but don't go to this place when their busy time; such as brunch time:))    After we ordered about half hour; our food still not show up and we ask the server that we waiting long time. You know what; our server told us ""you guys only waited 22 mins."" WHat the hell is that answer supposed to be???!!!!  And we ask separate check the guy said ""we dont do separate check when we are busy."" :)) Well... i dont offer tip when you busy then:)))) Who fking cares!! [REVIEW_7] This location used to be good; several years ago. About 3 years ago it started to go downhill and now it is just terrible. There were 2 people working on a Saturday evening. Nearly all the tables were full and there were people waiting to order and to pay. The sandwich that was made for me was on hard bread; burnt and barely edible. They need to either shape up or ship out. [REVIEW_8] Great neighborhood bar; with a casual atmosphere.  This place is always extremely clean and the staff is always friendly and cheerful.    Village Pub offers a good selection of beers which are priced very well.  Style points awarded for serving the Dark & Stormy in vintage pewter mugs.  In regards to food offerings; don't forget to try the Italian Sausages; they are incredible! [REVIEW_9] Stayed at the Holiday Inn while on vacation; and thought we would give it a try this place is beautiful! Right on water; big and lots to see. Live music was great! I expected great food to come out and what I got was frozen seafood!!! Ordered the calamari- looked great but tasted like frozen fried with no season at all!! Kids got chicken fingers and a burger which also taste frozen and the burger no joke tasted just like a frozen bubba burger you get from the store. Also got the Mango Mai Mai; this I thought for sure would be good but again the fresh was rubbery; over cooked tasted frozen; the baked potato tasted to be old. When it came time to pay; i have my server a $100 bill she brings me back change for a $50! Not cool at all! In all honesty the only thing this place is good for is drinks. I'm very disappointed in it ! I should have saved the money and walked over to Crabby Bills! [REVIEW_10] This is the worst. My first time at an Econo anything. Playing nice for group purposes. We get here. They check us in like the rooms are clean. The rooms are dirty. The lady comes to clean the room because apparently they dont have any others clean or available. Go figure. So the manager comes outside to look as if we are lying about dirty rooms. It's hot as hell outside; wasps everywhere and we're standing here. I asked about other clean rooms and he (a-hole manager) (neil Patel) sarcastically states check in is at 2. It's 1:45 though. If you're going to check guest in at least make sure the rooms are clean or let them know it will be a few. So I'm standing outside in the heat as they apparently clean the room.  They took no cleaner in to clean counters; bathroom; etc. Just nasty. Then they just looked in the microwave & fridge to see if it was clean. They didn't wipe nothing. I would never stay at this filthy mofo or any Econo Lodge. Just nasty. Go w/ a big brand like Marriot; Starwood or Hilton where customer satisfaction is part of their branding scope. This -ish is for the birds and folks who need a place for a quickie.... Not even that.",1
50,[REVIEW_1] Really good; fresh good. Wine and beer selections better than most 'strip mall' restaurants. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. This was my first trip so I'm looking forward to coming bak and trying about her tasty treat. The chocolate cake is dark; moist and very good. Come enjoy. [REVIEW_2] Stopped in here while on a quick trip to Nashville! Very instagram-worth spot with cool sofas and fun decor. We had the pickle flight and nachos; along with several cocktails. Nachos were so good--made with homemade potato chips?!? Take me back! [REVIEW_3] Amazing Sunday brunch! Yes; they do have unlimited champagne or mimosas for their Sunday brunch. Not only is the food delicious; service exceeds expectations and you'll never worry about your glass being empty. 18.99 plus tax gives you all the food you can possibly handle; along with frequent refills. Even if you have only coffee or just water; they keep the refills coming! Excellent service; awesome price and delicious food. Our server; Maria; went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. Thank you; El Dorado Casino; for the best brunch we've had in Reno. We will definitely be back on our next visit! [REVIEW_4] There is no help in the appliance section. If you do receive help they don't know what they are talking about. Bad service. Sears home Appliance store in Springfield is definitely a better option if you're looking to get great prices and great service [REVIEW_5] Masssimo is a genius! So glad he's back. Best Italian food i ever in such a unique; intimate and friendly environment. [REVIEW_6] My hair is very thin and it is hard to find anyone to put the micro beads in my hair tight enough and the weave bar are far most the best ones so far and if a few get loose I just go in and they do it for me. I love my extentions and I am glad I found them!!! My daughter loves them as well...she comes all they way from Kutztown!! [REVIEW_7] Excellent food and big portions! The veggie burrito is by far the best burrito I have ever had! Will definitely be eating here again. [REVIEW_8] The food is excellent and the service was awesome; and Scot the Executive Chef and Proprietor makes you feel like you are part of the family. I got the grilled oyster and shrimp po'boy; and I asked for the Tabasco mayo. And if you like libations; the Old Fashion is definitely a good choice! Featured on Diners; Drive-Ins; and Dives [REVIEW_9] I LOVE this place! If you are looking for a quick adjustment without all of the unnecessary chatter about supplements and yoga then this is the place. I was in and out in ten minutes and I felt amazing. I had all of my questions answered and felt well taken care of plus it is super affordable. [REVIEW_10] This place was worth the wait!  Their lobster pasta was really good !,9
51,"[REVIEW_1] When in the middle of nowhere with just a few hours before a flight home; I bought too much stuff for my New Years trip to St. Louis and figured I'd check to see if I could get a used suitcase for a good price.  I found a Samsonite suitcase for $6.   SIX DOLLARS.  I know if I went to Ross or TJ Maxx it would have been $130 easy.   So thanks again Goodwill.  You always seem to do me right in the heat of the moment which is why I always donate to you guys before anyone else with my old unused clothing items.  Happy New Year. [REVIEW_2] This is one of my favorite hibachi grills of all time. The cooks are always so wonderful; and the food is amazing. [REVIEW_3] Thoroughly displeased with Ray Brandts customer service. I was only able to get in touch with a person if I called before 8 am. (Business hours for service are 7 a.m. - 6 p.m.) I left voicemail's two days in a row; last week and this week; while no one attempted to contact me back. I was told my car would be looked at on Monday or first thing Tuesday morning. Left two voicemail's on Tuesday; no return call was made. I finally get in touch with someone on Wednesday and they have yet to look at my car. The appraisal states the work is to take 1 day to complete. They proceed to tell me it will be next week before I; might; have my car back. I get that hundreds of people had damage to their vehicles when my was damaged. However; this does not provide an excuse for poor customer service. I am spending a good deal of money and if no one wants to communicate with me there are multiple shops that want my money and will be more than happy to not only answer; but return my calls. (Ray Brandt returned 1 or my 7 calls over a week and a half) [REVIEW_4] Really truly slow service.  Not the waitress. The kitchen. 40 min to get a pasta and salad.  Recommended if you want to really drag that date out. [REVIEW_5] I would give this place zero stars if I could. They advertise 2 paddle boards and all year only one paddle board and no paddle. Filthy conditions.  When u contact front desk they say management will call u but they don't. Units are not clean when students move in.  They allow animals. Configuration of the apartment is horrible. Like living in a cell block. Kitchen is too small. Not enough area for food prep or dish storage.   They put on a good show when students are checking the place out but it is bait and switch. Don't rent here [REVIEW_6] I'm new to the area and was looking for a bikini wax for a weekend at the beach. Did my research (mostly yelp!) and scheduled an appointment. The building was impossible to find (in an office building with NO signs whatsoever or indication of the spa); and when I arrived the front desk staff was on the phone; busy; and had no time for me. She checked my name in and told me to sit down; then walked away before I could ask where the waiting area was.   The wax was the worst wax I've ever had - and I've been waxing for years. Erica didn't double-dip the sticks; but used the paper strips over and over; which I found unsettling. The conversation was fine; she was pleasant enough but did a terrible job. This next part is a bit ahem; graphic; so first-time waxers beware...   Compared to other aestheticians that take their time and position your legs in various positions to get the best possible view and angle for waxing; she simply had me open one leg at a time and waxed the entire area like that. This was much more painful; as each area was not pulled taut when she waxed; and resulted in an unsightly (not to mention painful) bruise in my nether regions. The rest of the area was red for hours longer than it usually is.  Then; when I went to pay; the girls behind the desk were *again* on the phone/talking/too busy to talk to me. After a while; I finally got someone's attention; but while I was her asking a question; the phone rang. Without so much as asking me to hold on; she answered it; began talking; and walked away. I signed my credit card receipt and stood there awkwardly; alone; wondering if I was finished. Finally; when they noticed me; I asked if I was done. The woman said yes and just waved me away.   I escorted myself out; feeling dismissed and completely unimportant. Although the spa is very nice and high-end; I got the impression they cater preferentially to more wealthy clientele; and regular people like me were just dismissed without a thought. [REVIEW_7] I worked with the Sultans of Schlep last week on a small move within center city. I had a great experience for a number of reasons:  -Tom is extremely attentive; responsive; and easy to work with -They have fair prices -The movers were on time and worked efficiently -They provided wardrobe boxes at no extra cost -They have a cool and funny name (don't you think?)  I would definitely work with them again! [REVIEW_8] Food is great. Got food poisoning. Sooooo not going Back there ever. Check out koizi in Tampa [REVIEW_9] Great neighborhood bar; with a casual atmosphere.  This place is always extremely clean and the staff is always friendly and cheerful.    Village Pub offers a good selection of beers which are priced very well.  Style points awarded for serving the Dark & Stormy in vintage pewter mugs.  In regards to food offerings; don't forget to try the Italian Sausages; they are incredible! [REVIEW_10] Heed the warnings. Long lines; poor service; HORRIBLE food. I'm sorry; but everything we were served was just nasty. We had a 3 hour layover and I neglected to look at the reviews prior to us getting a table.  We passed by several tables on our way to our seats and everyone's food looked straight nasty. But we stuck it out and went on and ordered anyway. We started with some cheese sticks. These were so gross. When they arrived on our table; they were soaked with some kind of weird brown juice. I assume it was the oil they were fried in that looked like it was last changed prior to the Exxon-Valdez oil spill back in '89. Horrible; burnt; greasy; and very ""off"" flavor. Our table mate next to us ordered the ravioli bites; they were also covered in the brown oil grease and they didn't even eat 1/2 of them.  Our pasta dishes were equally as disappointing and gross. I opted for the lasagna; and it was NASTY. The pasta itself was overcooked; which I can live with if bolstered by a decent sauce; quality/fresh meat; and good cheese. This lasagna offered NONE of these things. The sauce was the worst offender. Packed with sugar; it was a VERY SWEET; very thin red/marinara sauce. There were no spices or typical Italian seasonings; no garlic; no onion flavor; none of the deep; rich flavors that typically adorn good Italian-style food. The cheese was cheap and rubbery; and there was NO MEAT in the lasagna to speak of. Literally; I had NONE in my dish. It was absent; and sorely needed.  DO NOT EAT HERE. You WILL regret it.",4
52,"[REVIEW_1] I could make a jacks pizza taste better than their pizza with little effort.  We ordered two pizzas both horrible. Taste like cheap ingredients. Shouldn't be around long. [REVIEW_2] Echoing everyone else's frustration about Philly's 2013 ""race"" - expensive parking; storm came; chaos ensued and we never got refunds! It was actually a dangerous situation; with thousands of people running around a park at night in thunder and lightening; and they never came back to Philly... [REVIEW_3] This is not an authentic sushi place.  If you are going to order spicy tuna and salmon then this the places for you; else wait for dinner and head over to Double Knot [REVIEW_4] Eek no kidding. There are some positives and I guess I better start with that....The price here is not so bad; there are Chinese restaurants that have crazier prices. Also there have been some good events that occur here and tones of room.  Well and thats pretty much it. The service is not exactly the best; they only come do something when asked to. However they at least do things here...read my other reviews. The building itself is just gross; just GROSS. We saw them put paper in the food. Seriously not only that; there is a stage and there are alot of shitty events; such as old asian people thinking they can sing...really who wants to listen to this crap! Biggest headache of my life. To add insult to injury is get ready for the salties food on earth. Its like the chef have no taste buds and have to salt everything to death. You can probably get serious hypertension in this place.  Overall this is a great place. Overall score: 2.5/10 Food Quality: 1/5 Portion Size: 3.5/5 Service: 2/5 Kitchen Speed: 3/5 Decor: 1/5 Location: 3/5 [REVIEW_5] Ordered delivery through Postmates to be delivered to our hotel room. The delivery guy was very very friendly. However; the restaurant did not pack any utensils or napkins. Please be mindful when you are packing the food. [REVIEW_6] Waited 1 hour for a simple salad. This place takes forever to bring out your food! The service is slow and horrible.  I had to ask for my salad to go since I had a plane to catch.  When I was able to finally eat my salad; they forgot to put a side of salad dressing; needless to say my salad was awful!  There are plenty of other restaurants you can go to; don't waste your precious time and hard earned money on this dump! [REVIEW_7] I have to get my prescriptions filled at CVS. As with any medical facility hand sanitizer should be offered to reduce transmission of disease.  There bottle of sanitizer has been empty for a week and I complained to the clerk who told me it is not for my use anyway.  I told her it should be because I am forced to use their disease ridden pen pad to sign for my prescriptions.  She then smugly said I was free to bring my own sanitizer.  I hate doing business with CVS and can't wait to transfer to Target. [REVIEW_8] I'm not sure what happened here; but this place went downhill fast. I just had a pizza steak and chicken parm sandwich that were a step above edible. Seriously; I'm still trying to get the taste of the pizza steak out of my mouth. The only thing worse than being excited for a steak sandwich and having it suck is being excited for wings and having them forget to send the damn blue cheese!! Really?? Come on! I can honestly say that based On this experience; I would never go back.   First review: Great food and friendly service. We had an Italian hoagie; and cheesesteak hoagie; and hot wings. All we're fantastic. The rolls are soft and fresh. They were full of delicious meat. The wings were large and the hot sauce is the best I've had in the area. I'll be back for sure. [REVIEW_9] I'm only giving this place a one star for the convenience since it was next to my hotel.  I should have either saved my money or eaten at the gas station down the street!  I ordered the Asparagus soup with crab meat; green beans; and chicken salad wrap.  Well I couldn't even swallow one taste of the soup; yes I had to spit the mystery goo out. Tasted spoiled!!  The chicken salad had no flavor at all and was very dry. As I picked through it I found a lot fat. A total waste of money. The food ruined my appetite!! [REVIEW_10] If you want a hamburger or steak this isn't your joint.  So going to Pita Jungle was not my choice but my soon to be in-law's choice.  The patio is great to sit outside when it gets cooler out; it's laid back atmosphere is very much vegan- tree hugger.  I guess If you like veggies and healthy stuff this is your place to go. Personally me I'm a meat and potato type of gal who isn't your typical ""I'll order a salad and water""   The prices are very reasonable and from what others ordered it appeared the deep friend cauliflower was amazing.",0
53,"[REVIEW_1] Quick lunch today;  haven't been here at there new location yet; but today that changed. Carolina Chicken with Blueberry habanero sauce. Awesome!  I will be back for dinner with friends and BYO guaranteed. [REVIEW_2] Yah Man was yah man! Go here and enjoy the atmosphere; the personal service and delicious Caribbean fare. The beef pie was yummy as was the chicken and island sampler plates. The bread pudding was to die for. We left full and happy. If you live in the Tampa area or are visiting you should go here! Nice people! BTW; this is the 3rd time I've posted on yelp just wanted to share this place; so good! [REVIEW_3] I have walked by this restaurant countless times; so sweetheart and I finally ventured in.  First observation was that only 2 small tables were full when we arrived; yet I needed a haircut by the time our food arrived.  Second; I ordered a mild chicken dish (which was down-right bland); and sweetheart ordered a spicy seafood dish; which was absolutely ridiculously hot.  I do not exaggerate when I say that 1/3 red hot chili peppers.  Virtually inedible!  This restaurant is clearly a horror; living off of the tourists.  No Philly dweller would frequent this place. [REVIEW_4] Before starting our trip;  boyfriend and I were looking for a spot for dinner near our hotel.  We agreed upon Itty-Bitty for their great reviews.  They are small and filled up quick.  We shared an ordered of breaded mushrooms.  The marinara sauce was divine.  I ordered a mushroom swiss burger with sauteed onions and boyfriend ordered hamburger; both with side of onion rings.  The burgers were so juicy and good.  The onion rings were like crispy onion straws. And were really good dipped in ranch.  The waitress was very nice and personable and it was a great experience.  Prices were very reasonable and was cool to see the Route 66 mural and the license plates from different states.  We may have to stop back before our trip back home. [REVIEW_5] Went here based on the high ratings and raves from people.  The entire experience was underwhelming from start to finish.  Their website which is fairly useless if you want to figure out the menu before going; you have to pick your location choice out of 3 locations and then drill down to the bottom to see the weak descriptions of their menu offering; no explanations and no price; just this      Roast Beef     Roast Beef Combo     Roast Pork     Roast Pork Combo     Baked Ham     Baked Ham Combo     Roast Turkey     Roast Turkey Combo     Broccoli Rabe     Broccoli Rabe Combo   No explanation of whats in a combo (its just where they add cheese by the way)  The table placecard (instead of menu) had a more detailed description than the website.    When I walked in; its more bar than restaurant; no big deal; but there were tables.  Since I couldnt decide and the sandwiches werent too expensive at $6.85; I got the roast beef and roast port combos.  I got my two sandwiches fast enough; but the roast beef was cold and the roast pork was hot.  Not sure how a cook (for lack of a better word) could serve 2 things at the same time with such a temperature differential; one was obviously sitting for awhile.  I asked the waitress to reheat the roast beef while I finished the roast pork; and supposedly it was reheated; since it was warmer; but it was still cold-ish compared to my roast pork I had just finished.  The waitress did offer to replace it when she inquired; but I was in a hurry and didnt really care for a hot version of this sandwich.  The sandwiches were very skimpy on meat; but they ""made up for it"" by adding too much gravy to make it overly messy and the bread was disintegrating.  The menu place card mentions the ""wet meat"" option where you get less gravy; I strongly recommend you get it that style; especially if the gravy overpower the meat and structural integrity of the sandwich. [REVIEW_6] I will never eat there again. I ordered chicken Parmesan and after about four bites I realized my chicken was raw!  The manager Gary  said this hardly ever happens. What? Like it was a common occurrence. This place will never last. I ignored a good friends advice saying he had a bad meal there. Next time I will listen. [REVIEW_7] Really good food and great service! They have their own fish market right next door so I bought Jambalaya and Gumbo to take back to Miami! [REVIEW_8] I come here often.  My little mexican mom enjoys the food and the pleasant servers.  My wife always likeds coming here as well.  I love the soups.  They have a variety of soups; I have tried them all.  Authentic flavors ; like my abuelitas.  Very good mexican comfort food. As well as sonoran seafood.  Mmm mmm. [REVIEW_9] Great little local eatery! Had the lunch buffet. Fried chicken; grits; mac & cheese; gumbo and bread puddin'! So yummy! Wholeheartedly recommend this place! [REVIEW_10] This is my first-ever Yelp review; and it's well-deserved. I went to Jean Madeline Aveda with hopes of getting a dye job gone wrong fixed. Going from pink to dark brown is a big project! Sarah took amazing care of me for the five hours I was there; doing a terrific job with color; highlights; and a blowout. I'm beyond happy with the work they did there; and the price cannot be beat! Five hours is a long time but there was a lot of work to be done and Sarah was a trooper all throughout - and very friendly and personable! I will definitely be going back to this salon in the future.",7
54,"[REVIEW_1] What has happened to squeal? This was in my opinion one of the best rib joints in town but they must be under new management or something. I stopped here for ribs on memorial day which should be the crown jewel for bbq places and I swear I could have thrown the whole plate away. The ribs had a 13 degree burn though surprisingly still juicy but no taste to them at all except for the smoke flavor. I asked for sauce and they bring you a thimble of some can sauce when they used to have very spicy flavorful ribs and a great sauce to go with them. In fact the ribs were so flavorful you didn't need sauce. This is twice now that I have been and been disappointed which probably means I will never go again. Not to mention  the sides that were never that great were even worse than before. Lightly boiled greens with no taste and the worst cole-slaw I have ever had. As I walk out I was not the only unsatisfied customer. This place does not have a long life left I think. [REVIEW_2] Food here is amazing! Ordered beef ragu and chicken ragu. Both dishes are very tasty! Plus it's BYOB!!! [REVIEW_3] Stopped in for the lunch menu with my girlfriend; place was extremely clean; food was ON POINT!  And AFFORDABLE Can't wait to go back!! [REVIEW_4] Always fantastic.  Great food; great service.  Wish we had one on the north side.  Great for gluten free [REVIEW_5] One out of three dishes was good. I ordered what was highlighted on Guy's show. The chargrilled oysters were fine. The pizza and the crawfish beignets looked like they should be amazingly delicious; but that fake white American-tasting cheese ruined it for me. End of story. [REVIEW_6] never gets old. i get the chocolate malt with light on the chocolate. best ice cream custard thing i have ever had in my life. [REVIEW_7] This is one of the WORST venues I've been too and definitely won't be coming back. I came here over the weekend to see Primus and I was so disappointed in both the layout of the place and the people that worked there. First the security at the door was confused; they took our tickets and then walked back in the place; leaving us outside. When he finally decided to return he actually asked us for our tickets (even though he took them with him). After rummaging through his pockets...tada! He found them and finally let us in.  We were escorted upstairs to the bar & restaurant where we were told they were out of food menus and they would give us one when it came available...so that's when the waiting game began. We waited about 10 minutes for a menu and then it took about 15 minutes for someone to circle back around and take our order. After placing our order it took them over 30 minutes to make one chicken caesar wrap. Once we finally got our food they proceed to ""kick us out"" because they needed to get the top floor ready for the show - so frustrating! The night continued to go just as frustrating. The layout of this place is rectangular and very long so if you don't get there early and man your spot; good looking getting a glimpse at the stage. They cram over 1000 people in this small club and if it wasn't for the TV screens people would have missed the show entirely. I feel horrible for about 70% of the people that came to watch the show; there is really no good seat in the house. Also their security is absolutely horrible; they were constantly rushing through the crowds to stop people from smoking or taking pictures. When they weren't shoving you to get through they were shining a flashlight in your eyes. We also had security shove us out of the way so he could stand in front of us and take video himself of the band that was playing. They are so unprofessional and rude. If you plan on going to see a show here; I wouldn't recommend it especially if there's going to be a lot of people and a sold-out show because chances are you won't see anything. And I'm serious when I say it that only about 30% of the ticket holders could see anything; the rest of us were just standing around watching the TV screens. This place is super lame and I won't ever be back. [REVIEW_8] The worst sushi I have ever had. Huge pieces and weird rolls. Tried Bloomingdales role and the other roll that they recommend. Can't be any worse. There's potatoes or something with the roll. Weirdest event had. Strongly not recommend. Don't know how they got such a high review. [REVIEW_9] The manager Shawn Bracken and our waiter clearly care about their customers and the entire experience at PF Chang's. They went above and beyond on a busy night to make sure we were taken care of. Will definitely be coming back to this location. (Also recommended the Korean chicken which is not on the menu but is phenomenal) [REVIEW_10] Decent food but have some weird priorities and service quality is quite poor. Didn't take our orders until after we sat waiting for twenty min. Food took fourth min and a gentleman sat down after us and finished his food before we even got an apology that our food would be a while. Asked for water and was ignored or forgotten twice. Decent quality food but not worth the wait or poor service. In and out would have been better.. I take it back food was rushed and salt bombs made half the dish inedible and the other half bland",5
55,"[REVIEW_1] The IMA's collection rests on its chief benefactors; namely the Clowes; Lilly; Marmon and Pantzer families and their differing collecting tastes. While Indianapolis is a relatively old Midwestern city; the IMA's history is recent; it was known as the ""Art Association"" until 1969.  The recent multi-year renovation; redevelopment and expansion of the Museum and grounds created an entirely new experience for art patrons.  Let's all say our condolences to the Krannert Pavilion's Brutalist architecture of the 1970s and hello to a somewhat uninspired series of camera-ready atria that will no doubt allow some very impressive parties.  The collection itself is conservative and unprovoking.  Highlights include Robert Indiana's iconic masterwork (and trademark-infringed) ""LOVE"" painting and sculpture; a beautifully painted though incredibly ill-placed Rembrandt; a decent Hopper; an encyclopedic Asian art collection that is one of the best in the country; and the largest collection of JMW Turner drawings outside of Great Britain (although quantity does not trump quality).  I thought the gift shop was as poorly stocked as the previous one.  Not a single postcard of the new museum's exterior; yet there were plenty of old postcards showing the now-demolished Krannert Pavilion.  And for an artwork that's been copied; dubiously appropriated and downright stolen; why was there not one postcard available of Robert Indiana's outdoor ""LOVE"" sculpture?  And what about museum merchandise based off its own artwork: scarves with motif from the museum's Tiffany piece; jewelry pieces mimicking something from the Asian galleries or pop-up note cards laser-cut with the new museum facade?  Sure; all the ""LOVE"" stuff is nice; but capitalize on other museum strengths.  This is a wonderful museum that has a decent collection.  The parking is free; the new eating options are terrific; and there are other fun attractions on the museum grounds; most notably the Lilly estate; Oldfields. [REVIEW_2] Great setting. Food & service did not match the hip bar/restaurant. My friends and I (6 people) had a reservation for brunch on Sunday. We were the only table there and the bar was less than full. It took a very long time to get our drinks. Our server was not attentive. We weren't going to get our bottomless mimosas waiting around for her bc she was sitting & rolling silverware chatting it up with her co-worker. So I took our glasses directly to the  bartender for our refills instead. Food was mediocre at best. I ordered the hot chicken tacos which wasn't spicy at all. My friends ordered the lox; it was fishy and it was more like smoked salmon flakes; no actual slices of smoked salmon. Pricey for what it was. The steak my friend ordered was very salty. A very bad representation of Nashville eateries. I do not recommend going here. [REVIEW_3] Just ordered a veggie pizza and cinnamon sticks for carry out. The pizza toppings and cheese were really fresh. The cinnamon sticks were awesome! Our order was ready in 15 min. I will never eat Papa John's again.  Thank you; Dominos [REVIEW_4] Paper heaven! I love this store! It has almost everything I need in terms of paper and art supplies.   They also change their displays to show examples of what can be done with their materials (i.e. cute wrapping ideas; favor boxes; etc). It changes pretty often; and I always take pictures of them when I visit.   The workers are quick to help and knowledgeable.   Pretty pens; gorgeous wrapping paper; adorable stamps; etc. This place will satisfy your artistic needs. [REVIEW_5] I first dined here for dinner about 3 years ago and have since gone back a handful of times...Just realized I've never checked in or written a review! Ive coulda been the Duchess already! LOL... I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE! Very romantic...Service has always been excellent! The free bread is sooo delicious!! So is the chili and filet mignon... Food is homemade and fresh! And the Tri-tip on Sundays is truly the best Tri-tip sandwich I've ever had...this is a must try; especially for dinner... [REVIEW_6] Terrible experience. Went in looking for some new frames. Found the frame shape I was interested in and started trying on a couple of frames. An employee came over and I told him I wanted a frame very similar to the ones I currently have (needed new ones since mine were cracked a little around the ear part). I mentioned that my current pair were a little bent; but that they worked for me. I took off the glasses to show him and he took them and said that he was going to adjust them. I didn't ask for him to do that and I was VERY hesitant after he said that he would not be liable if they broke. I told him that I'd rather he not adjust them; because they were my only pair (and I didn't ask him to do it in the first place!). Then as he handed them back to me; he said rudely; ""Well; I'll just put 12 years of experience in my pocket!"" I felt embarrassed; so I decided to leave. As I was leaving he said he didn't mean to offend me; but it was too late. Poor customer service FOR EYES! [REVIEW_7] Lüke. One of the first restaurants in NOLA I chose to call my fave 4 years ago.   This thought still holds true today.   It's my fave because so many dishes have been my go-to since the beginning. Eggs in a jar...go-to; shrimp and grits...go-to; pain perdu....still shouting from the rooftops.   It's also my fave because of this reason; always changing and bringing the best to the table. Softshell crab BLT; croque monsieur; and beignets oh my!   I can't leave out the bevs... French pressed Joe and a French 75 to start your adventure in New Orleans.   Did I mention they have a spectacular looking bar? Go see for yourself. [REVIEW_8] So disappointed; I'm so embarrassed! This is a $50 mixed bouquet! Trader Joe's makes better arrangement! Mostly green filler with a couple mum; iris and Gerber daisy. [REVIEW_9] Like wholefoods but much smaller. They have all sorts of stuff from Salad bar; to a small selection of fresh fruits; juice bar. Great lil grocery store. Couldn't really find any other in the city. They have a parking lot. Great walking; just a couple blocks from clothing stores [REVIEW_10] Will never shop here again!!! My best friend is getting married and I went in to find a bridesmaid dress. The staff wasn't super helpful and I got ignored until I went up and ask someone for help and told her what color of dress I was looking for. They said they didn't have any in stock but they could order a dress and it would be here in a week. So I sat down went through the style book and picked out the style of dresses I liked. The employ told me to leave my name and number and the manager would text me pictures of dresses with the prices that night. I never received a text or phone call from them. So about a week and a half later I called and asked them what was going on. The lady who answered the phone said she would leave a message and they would again call me back that night and get everything figured out. Let's just say it's been 3 weeks and I still haven't heard a word. The wedding is now in 2 weeks and luckily I was able to find a dress else where.",6

Decent quality food but not worth the wait or poor service. In and out would have been better.. I take it back food was rushed and salt bombs made half the dish inedible and the other half bland [REVIEW_2] This was my second visit here; and it was much worse than the first. This restaurant is extremely small; and if there aren't any seats; you are welcome to stand in the back by the bar without seating; in the way of all the commotion. We stood by the bar for about ten minutes before we were asked if we needed something. We wanted to eat; but not standing up. We saw multiple tables open up; and had to ask if we could sit there; even though we were the only people waiting. We finally sat; and a young;brunette waitress came and took our order. We wanted two orders of the Short Rib fries appetizer; since we would be having it as our dinner opposed to sharing it; and she looked at us like we asked her to bring the whole cow to our table. She asked us if we were sure that we wanted two; and we confirmed that we did. The first order came out in about 5 minutes which was amazing. 10 minutes went by; then 15; and our server didn't even come over to see how our first dish was; just stood in the corner chatting. We got another servers attention after 20 minutes of waiting and let him know we were still waiting on our order. We also advised him that if it wasn't ready; to forget about it and we would share the first one. He came back and told us that it would be out any second. Another ten minutes went by; still no dish; still nothing from our original server. We let the young man know that we were no longer interested in the dish that was 25 minutes late; and then our original server finally decided to come over! Could you believe the first thing she said was ""so im hearing that you never got the second batch of fries?"". As if it was some kind of rumor. Then had the nerve to ask if we still wanted it. She took it off the bill but I was extremely disappointed with the service; and will certainly not return the next time I am in town. Especially since I got sick in the middle of the night from it. Village Whiskey; please train your staff how to serve properly; and give them some lessons on customer service. [REVIEW_3] This is a great place to stay. I picked it because of the full kitchen; it was very helpful. We didn't spend as much money on food. Its very clean and cute! [REVIEW_4] I would do 0 stars if I could! This company took full payment for a bed and never delivered it. I sent 3 emails and many phone calls and not once did I receive a reply or call back nor did I ever receive an update on my purchase. The few times when someone answered when I called I was told it was on back order and then the day it was suppose to be delivered and wasn't; I called and was told it was discontinued. My money should have been refunded that day and in my account three days later( I was assured it was being refunded that day). It never got to my account and two phone calls later found out they never refunded it but was once again assured that they would refund it that day. I am now afraid I am going to have to take legal action to get my money back. I complained to managers and write emails but it does not seem to matter. Worst company and service ever!!! [REVIEW_5] The best soon-dubu in the city!  This place is tucked away and once you walk in; it's like you've stepped into a Korean home.  Very welcoming; warm and inviting.  It's very vegetarian friendly!  The soft tofu is stewed and put into the dol sot pots which each and every stew feels like it's custom made for you.   You can select from beef; seafood or mixed meats (seafood & beef); mushroom; and just plain.  They can adjust the spice as needed too.  I always get the extra hot with the hot temperature; can't beat it.  The rice also comes in a dol-sot which is great if you leave it in for a while; it burns the rice into a nice crispy shell.  DROOL.  Just thinking about this place makes my mouth salivate!    If you're not into tofu; they also offer korean bbq meats (cooked in the back); with other soup/stew items.  Love this place!!! [REVIEW_6] How has this place survived???? In Germantown no less?!?!?!? The old guy behind the counter (I'm assuming he's the proprietor) was unwelcoming; surly; and kinda rude. I only ordered a cheesesteak with fried onions...admittedly without looking at the menu..and when he told me it was $8.90; I thought I jumped into a wormhole and was in South Philly at Pat's or Geno's. Let me just jump to my summation...it wasn't worth $8.90. Did they pass a new cheesesteak tax too??? It's all good and lesson learned. I will be going back to the papi stores and getting a much better cheesesteak for half the price. And they should be ashamed for fleecing people for using credit/debit cards. Hell..they even charge more for SPENDING more. Who does that???? [REVIEW_7] This place surpassed our expectations!  The steak is far superior to any steak house I have been too.  The staff flows together like a well trained team; the hostess Mallory; our waiter Max; and the busboy all keep things moving smoothly and leave you never wanting for anything.  Honestly the whole experience was amazing and we will be back for more. Love this place! [REVIEW_8] Unexpected surprised by the coolness of the coffee shop.  Didn't think much of the place at first but then  I noticed  it's tied in to a outdoor store; which immediately made it awesome.    Look for little detail in the style of the place (such as carbiners and cam lobes in the cement). Coffee was very good too.  Sweet offerings of speciality drinks. (Pumpkin something during my visit)   Fun A+ coffee shop for the non-pompous type [REVIEW_9] Finding out that your home will need new drainage fields installed is never a good thing to hear however Jim and his crew were easy to deal with and got the job done right. I would highly recommend Cote's for your septic needs. [REVIEW_10] Unhelpful; unapologetic; and not worth the hassle. I will take my business elsewhere in the future.",5
57,"[REVIEW_1] My friends and I went here one time for margaritas; and we sat outside. We were charged a $5 cover; and I have literally NEVER encountered as horrible service as I have at Copa. After we got drinks we didn't see the waitress again. We actually had to go inside to close our tab. [REVIEW_2] I went In For a diagnostic. Told the issue (that is unrelated to this post)....afterwards my car would not start. So the mechanic put my car in neutral ....not drive....and then it started. It did not do that to begin with.....so when I got home it would not park!!!! And I didn't go for that problem at all!!!!! [REVIEW_3] Paid for the $25 wash and detail (the most deluxe package they offer); added leather cleaning for $20. My dog had been in the car while muddy so there was dried dirt on the backseat; which I mentioned. I knew when they called me after only 15 min that it wasn't cleaned well. When I saw it it was obviously that they hadn't cleaned the leather at all. When I said that to the guy he sprayed a towel and literally wiped down the back seat for less than a minute. Didn't clean any other leather on the headrests; doors; console-anywhere. The wipe down on the cup holders; steering column; etc was just as bad. The vacuuming was terrible; didn't get under the mats or the way back. They didn't clean the rims at all even the the package included rim detail and shine. I basically paid $45 for a drive through car wash. [REVIEW_4] Wasn't impressed by the crazy long lines and only 1 person working; took absolutely forever and was definitely not worth it. The food was terrible and so was the coffee. Definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. [REVIEW_5] Ordered from grubhub waited an hour and a half for delivery so I called naturally no one picked up for another 20 minutes then when the guy answers his explanation was that they were on break and hadn't made my order yet and gave me the "" oh well"" attitude and didn't offer any kind of compensation. [REVIEW_6] The pho is abysmal. There is no flavor to it; it literally tastes like boiled water. The noodles were clumped together when the bowl got to me; which means they didn't make the noddles fresh; but they've been sitting around for some time. The meat used in the pho is was chewy. [REVIEW_7] DO NOT GO THERE . The male waiter was only looking at my 7 year old daughter and I tried to get his attention  away but couldn't; a real creeper. The cook in the back looked in our direction and laughed. Will never go back  . Horrible place. please help to rip those guys a new one. [REVIEW_8] Do not eat here! I ordered general tso tofu and asked for it to be extra crispy with light sauce. Not only did it come out FULL of sauce; but they refused to replace it and only offered to drain the extra sauce. Needless to say; it was bland and soggy. Never again. [REVIEW_9] DON'T GO HERE FOR UBER. I have had the WORST buying experience of my life here. I walked into this dealership for the first time around the end of June. The sales people seemed helpful and answered my questions at first. I even came back a couple times before I made a decision on the car. On saturday July 2nd I made the deposit and was promised a car the following friday (July 8) latest. I patiently waited checking back a couple times throughout the week to get updates on the situation to make sure everything went smoothly. Not only was it extremely time consuming because they just didn't wanna help you out until your presence became an annoyance to them; they also kept lying to get me to leave; giving me deadlines they never met. They constantly told me that they would call me back and let me know but they never did. Today 12 days have past; and they still did not give me a proper response regarding the fate of the promised car. Today someone actually picked up the phone and after giving me a very unclear response about the fate of the car shut down the phone without letting me respond. Very rude. Who is going to reimburse me 9 days (taking out 3 days that they initially promised to deliver) of not being able to work? On average I lost more than a $1000 already by not being able to work and I still don't know what will happen. Forget about the money; the negative attitude and treatment you will receive here is not worth any money in the world. [REVIEW_10] My Samsung 650 TV would not turn on. The red light in the front panel just goes on and off. I call Caden. First they charged $40.00 to come over to look at. Then he wrote a bill for $410.00 for repair. I guess I  look old and dumb; but he seems to be sincere. So I let him do the work. Next day; he said he had fixed the problem and will bring over. The TV came back and he gave me a 6 months warranty. I did some research on this problem and found out it is only the capacity problem. And it is relatively cheap to fix. The maximum will cost you for less than $180.00. So; watch out for Caden to sock to you. Call other first before you call him.",0

Try the pickle chips or the wedge salad. [REVIEW_2] McDonalds... What do you need to know?..   They serve the purpose. I'd complain about the inaudible Spanish fellow working the drive through but why would I expect much else..  Update:  they just charged me .25 cents for ranch..  I'm pretty wealthy actually but this stuff is so annoying.  I handed him a dollar; took 4 of them and walked to the trash can to throw away 3 of them as I only needed one.  I feel I made my point.. [REVIEW_3] Sassafras Restaurant has a nicely-decorated exterior (strip mall) and a very attractive; clean; neat; and welcoming interior. The waiter was very friendly and helpful. We ordered Seafood Platters; which came with catfish; oysters; shrimp; fries; and a delicious house salad; as an appetizer. The salad dressings were home made; and the fried seafood items were well seasoned and not the least bit greasy. Also; the portions were generous. We were all very pleased and remarked that we would certainly return. RJT [REVIEW_4] I highly recommend this place and had a couple different very good specialists. I wanted to give a special shout out to Cecilia as she makes the experience as fast and pain free as possible. I always make sure I get her when it's been a while between visits. Her technique is excellent. She also gives me tips on what to do in between visits which I appreciate. Thank you; Cecilia! [REVIEW_5] i dont know what has happened to the in store service in this place!  We have been down here for a few weeks now and have been here 6 times.Only once was the order completed without a screw up!  Today 2 tall decaf coffees took close to 20 minutes.By then our bagels were cold.First i was told the decaf was ""brewing' and then i was told there was something 'wrong"" with the brewer? After 15 minutes i was offered a decaf americano. Before we left i politely told a fellow behind the counter the service was abominable and he said 'well we can only store 2 vente size decafs at a time? HUH? I asked if the management knew about this and he just shrugged. Clearly this staff has never been trained to make it right for the customer.No apology.No coupon.Just a convoluted story.   Amazing how you can have numerous people running around a store but you cant get the simplest order straight My next visit to a Starbucks will certainly not be this one. [REVIEW_6] This place is great! The service is fast and friendly. They have only messed up my order once; I called and they fixed it right away. Keep in mind I've ordered from them a lot over the years. [REVIEW_7] When they make you bleed and rush the entire time you know they don't want your business. I get me nails done every 2 weeks and have never been in this much pain or had my nails be so crooked before. The nail technician insulted the style and length I requested. I specifically made a google and yelp profile so I can warn people about this place. Never going back! [REVIEW_8] Gave this store one star only because I had to in order to post a review. Went here last week to get a new phone. Service was indifferent to say the least. Staff was condescending and barely polite. Not a good experience. [REVIEW_9] Last night I paid cover and bought two overpriced drinks and then went out dancing. It was so hot and stuffy that I got really thirsty. They refused to give me water! They said I had to buy a bottle for $2. I tried to reason with them; but they were pretty rude. I have never heard of a bar not giving someone water when requested. Bartender said that 7-11 did not have to give me water either ????? So weird; and such a bad policy considering how much I had already spent there and how hot it was. I will never go back. I refuse to spend another dollar there on principle. I ended up leaving; getting a cup of water from my car and walking back in with it.  After that I was mad at them; but trying to have fun for my friends' sake. Still I told the Rue 13 photographer that I did not want to be in their promotional photos; but they took pictures of me anyway.  Finally; my tights ripped because they snagged on splinters when I walked by their stage area.  Cheap quality; overpriced; bad service. Do not recommend! [REVIEW_10] This was a beautiful beach; very clean too. Easy parking (meter). Not too crowded. What more could you want? we rented a cabana and chairs for $25 (worth every penny)",5
59,"[REVIEW_1] I was really feeling for coffee and was nowhere near a Starbucks; so I decided to stop at this Tim Hortons. I was immediately impressed with how clean the store was. I have never been to a Tim Hortons before and Maryann was super sweet and spent a lot of time explaining the menu. The iced coffee that I eventually decided on was perfect! You guys have got yourselves a new regular! [REVIEW_2] So disappointed with this place. Read great reviews and had high hopes. We ordered Singapore noodles; honey garlic chicken; chicken balls & Chicken fried rice. Very bland taste; most of it went to the bin. For all you Irish people that are expecting it to be as good as home; it most certainly is nothing like it. [REVIEW_3] First visit to this new salad & pizza joint. Design your own or select from menu for either or both signature items. Ingredients are very fresh and available in a broad range of choices. I particularly liked the standard thin pizza crust which is made fresh daily on-site. My Greek salad was excellent. Bread sticks are very good. My mother-in-law enjoyed the salad with chicken; cukes; banana peppers and cheese that she created. Service was efficient and workers were knowledgeable and pleasant. I'll be back for an encore experience. [REVIEW_4] Good bagels; but they can NEVER get an order right.  We live in NJ so when you ask for Taylor Ham and cheese you think they would be able to handle this.    Instead I get a ham and cheese sandwich; or an egg; ham and cheese sandwich.  I am DONE with this place.  City Market or Lumberville General Store will be my two choices from here on out. [REVIEW_5] This place is a real gem in Ozona! It has been popping up on my yelp search for awhile now and I finally made the stop in Friday evening for dinner.  First off; probably the friendliest wait staff I have ever encountered. Smiling faces and ""aloha!""s are abundant. You get a strong sense that the entire staff takes wellness to heart. It's their passion; not a gimmick. It was a really gorgeous evening; so we sat outside on there spacious patio which had plenty of shaded cover and fans to keep you cool in the FL sun.   Everything is fresh and organic. We started out with gluten free beer (hooray!) and the hummus appetizer that comes with assorted veggies and gluten free crackers. The hummus was delicious. You can taste the fresh lemon juice! Perfect consistency and a large portion. We ended up taking quite a bit home with us.   For dinner I had the DaKine Bowl. So much great food! I was expecting probably a third of the portion I got. It wasn't just a large dinner; it was also very tasty and well seasoned.  Plenty of rice and beans to go.    I will definitely be back to not only to try their homemade kefir (!) but also some of their awesome sounding gluten free selections and delights. [REVIEW_6] What an amazing dinner!  The wonderful ambiance of this restaurant was enough for me; but when they brought out our food; I was mesmorized by the flavors!  The owner/chef came out to greet us and he shared a nice glass of limoncello with us.  You will not be disappointed in any way if you come here for dinner.  Everything we ate tasted like the chef prepared each dish with a little bit of ""love"" in every bite. [REVIEW_7] Great customer service! Love my new car! Highly recommend to anyone who's trying to buy a new used car in good shape! Talk to Andy if you want some good help! [REVIEW_8] I've been doing DIP powder for years. Every time it lasts 3-6 weeks without chipping. I did my nails here for the second time and within a week I had two broken nails. I went back and they fixed it but within two days more nails were chipping off. The pedicures are nice with the stones but after spending almost $70 in everything and my nails looking this bad after only a week I will not be going back here again. [REVIEW_9] Oh Ants Pants; you are the sunshine of our neighborhood.  Even though the selection of food isn't very vast; everything I've touched on the menu (which I'm pretty sure is all of it) is very; very good in a homemade meal way.  The staff is the greatest... from Paul to Teresa; to the owner herself.  They make you feel at home and never rushed.  They aren't afraid to voice their opinions on what is especially good that day; and take the time to small chat without seeming obligated.  There's a cute outdoor area in the back; and it's fairly easy to grab and go if that's your intention.  Beware that the place is small; but crowds seem to get in and out fairly quickly... mainly because the food comes out fast; hard to believe when only cooking on a couple burners and a toaster over.  The name Ants Pants can translate into The Bee's Knees in the US... I'm not really sure how either reference came into play; but it stands true at Ants Pants.  You'll end up being happy for half the day after eating here; and might meet some new friends along the way. Note: get the bacon stack; and any soup special they have. [REVIEW_10] I am writing this based on the concert/bar only.  We went to the Eddie Money concert and chose the General Admission tickets.  The VIP seats appeared to be very well placed for viewing.  Unless you arrive at least an hour early and wait at the rail constantly; or you are well over 6 ft; you will have a hard time seeing anything.  The stage is raised above the VIP crowd nicely; but appears to be level with the G/A crowd.  This leaves over 90% of the General Admission patron with a very 'limited view'.  I am 5' 11"" and could see the band from the neck up about 60% of the time.  I would guess that men under 5' 10"" and almost every woman not in the front spent most of the show watching on a screen to the side that had the resolution of a pizza parlor. The wait staff was understaffed and less than efficient.  The security staff was just down right RUDE.  The sound was nice.  Eddie Money was great.  But in the non-VIP area; the concert layout and the service left much to be desired. It might not be fair that a concert rating affects the restaurant rating; but if you choose to have concerts in your restaurant...",6
60,"[REVIEW_1] We came to eat last night with a pretty large party (9 people).  Being in a large party in a busy restaurant; you expect things to take a bit longer than normal. We were fine with that; given that this place came highly recommended.  We were seated within about 30 minutes; which was not bad given how busy they are. After sitting there for about 25 minutes; we had yet to be approached by a waiter. We let the hostess know and she sent a waiter over to us. He said that he would bring us all waters and be right back.   Around this time; another large party was seated at the table next to us. They appeared to have 7 people; which was confirmed when the waiter brought our waters to their table and mysteriously ended up with 2 extra glasses... A minute or two after that; a different waiter showed up and apologized; saying there was a mixup with the table assignments.  We figured that it'd be a good idea to go ahead and order while we actually had somebody's attention and placed our appetizer; food and drink orders and asked for waters. That waiter was never seen or heard from again; though... 20 more waterless minutes passed (45 minutes in total by this point) and we were tired of waiting..  To add insult to injury; though; the other large table that I mentioned had their drinks and appetizers delivered just then.  One person from our party approached the manager to complain and was basically just told; ""we're busy"". Yes; restaurants get busy and food may take a while; but 45 minutes and not even water? Needless to say; we just left and enjoyed a very good meal at Coop's Place a few blocks down.  It's not often that I feel compelled to leave a review; but this is definitely one of those occasions. It's funny how many reviews over the past year or two echo the exact same problems we experienced last night. You would expect management to take corrective actions; but I suppose they don't care as long as butts are still being put in seats. [REVIEW_2] Gee; Normands. It would have been nice if you had seen fit to update your website with the fact that you are closed for construction during a good chunk of August.   That way; my husband and i wouldn't have wasted time trying you this morning. Good thing Craft Beer Market was open.   Seriously. Add a freaking contact page to your website with important stuff like hours and you know; CLOSURES?   Once my husband has been burned by a place; it is nearly impossible to get him to return; so chances are; you may have lost him (us) for good. [REVIEW_3] Came in to order coctel de camaron my food had no avocado no cilantro asked the waiter as to why it did not have it they said they were out of avocado and did not know why it had no cilantro. Just said ;I can take the plate back poor customer service it seemed like they didn't care. Very disappointing; how can a restaurant not have avocado and what's worst nobody seemed to care. I was so eager to eat this establish food now am just leaving wothout eating nothing. [REVIEW_4] This was by far my favorite Cuban sandwich of all the Cubans I've had to date. We were treated to a free coffee after the meal as well as a spin of the wheel which led to a free dessert. Over all the experience was excellent.  I can't wait to go there again. [REVIEW_5] Such a disappointment. I was expecting this to be one of the best burgers I've ever had (as I've heard) and some of the best fries; and I was completely underwhelmed. I ordered a burger with truffle mushrooms and a fried egg- cooked medium. The burger was completely over-cooked; way too salty; crumbling on my plate; and I couldn't drown it in enough ketchup to make it taste good. The fries were soggy and cold. My stepmother ordered the chicken sandwich and the chicken was so dry! Shake shack is WAY better. Sad. A for presentation; F for execution. Sorry but; if you're known for burgers and fries you should have a chef who knows how to execute. [REVIEW_6] This place moved locations and when I placed a call in order the guy on the phone didn't even tell me or give me a heads up! I called to find out the new location and he gave me wrong directions! I was super bummed! No thanks! There is a ton of great Thai places in town with better service! [REVIEW_7] If I could give Zero stars I would. We are return customers to this restaurant and now we will never return. We will go out of our way to go to the one in mid-city. We ordered the new sandwich ""The BET"" and paid an extra $2.00 for extra cheese. We received this sandwich with close to ZERO cheese. You would think for a ""cheese"" themed restaurant all of their sandwiches would be gooey with cheese. WRONG. The cheese on the sandwich didn't even cover 1/2 of the 1/2 of one side of the piece of bread. We mentioned it to Ebony at the register that we paid for extra cheese and showed her the sandwich. She brought it to the kitchen and shortly returned to us with our sandwich in hand and said ""my kitchen supervisor said there is cheese on this sandwich and he can't help us"" we asked if we can just add more cheese and she said ""if we want more cheese we will have to pay for it"" (which we already did) ""and he refuses to remake it"" terrible kitchen staff and HORRIBLE at handling service. [REVIEW_8] Ordered food came super fast! But when we ordered dessert that's when it took 20 mins.  When the dessert came to the table my gf asks me is this supposed to have tomatoes I say no. She is about to eat her second bite and I tell her to stop. I find a piece of paper inside the bread pudding.  I ask for the manager and he comes over I inform him of these extra items. He offers me another bread pudding.... I decline. The waitress offered to refund my money for the dessert... [REVIEW_9] Came for all-you-can-eat; and ended up waiting for over half an hour to get our order in. The servers completely ignored us; while taking orders from the tables around us. And on top of that; all of the rolls contain ""extras"" not listed on the menu. One roll surprised us by having sweet mustard sauce on it; which did NOT taste very good.... On the bright side; once we actually got our orders in they didn't take all that long to make them. [REVIEW_10] I had the worst duck that I have ever had.  It was so tough that I could hardly cut into it.  The cherry sauce was uninspiring at best.  My wife had a curried sole; in which the turmeric was overwhelming.  The only creditable thing was that they agreed to take the duck off my bill.",1
61,"[REVIEW_1] Love!! Our new favorite local spot. We've gone a few times since they opened and it's always a good ambiance; and great food. The drinks are great; the salsa is super yummy; and the salads are very much entree sized. Bring your friends; sit outside; grab a margarita and enjoy! [REVIEW_2] Best wings in Indy. Get the signature sauce. Both locations have great atmosphere with awesome wait staff. [REVIEW_3] Wow; best cheesesteak in ChesCo and probably beyond.  I've been living in WC for over a year now and haven't had one place as a go-to for cheesesteaks.  Went to Westtown Meat Market the other day based on some Yelp reviews and was blown away by the cheesesteaks.   The quality and taste of the meat was top notch and it was on a great; fresh roll.    This is our go-to cheesesteak place for the foreseeable future.  My favorite in the Philly area still remains Steve's Prince of Steaks; but now there's some competition. [REVIEW_4] We wanted to pick up some Zima and a male employee was very nice and said they were sold out and Zima is sold out everywhere in town. So he helped us pick out something he said will be similar but turns out grocery stores and Walmart have Zima. Lies. Oh; and P.S. Mr. Man; Truly Lime and Midori tastes nothing like Zima and Midori so thanks for that too. [REVIEW_5] Took my 8 yr old daughter on a Sunday evening and unfortunately we lasted one trip around the rink before she asked to leave.   Pros: Lovely environment with pretty lights; numerous heating lamps; indoor seating area to get snacks and hot chocolate; pricing reasonable.   Cons: Rentals are hockey skates and not figure skates and weren't in the greatest of shape. Rink is pretty small for the amount of people they let on. Poorly tended ice - we got on right after they 'cleaned it up' and it was rough and choppy and the worst areas were the perimeter where inexperienced skaters would need smoother ice the most.   Staff was hit or miss. Some were very friendly and helpful and others were glum and ignored you. I got the impression we weren't the only unhappy patrons; as several people were also returning their skates and as mentioned the session had just begun. [REVIEW_6] I had such a great experience at Salon Fiber on New Year's Eve morning. I had been going to a salon in South Philly for years but never really clicked with the stylist I went to. I ended up getting an email from my old salon that the stylist had moved on; and since I've been spending most of my free time in Phoenixville; I decided to try out a new place there; and I'm so glad I did! Everyone at Salon Fiber was friendly and accommodating. I even got to make friends with the cutest 2 kids while we were waiting for Amber to finish their mom's hair. When it was time for my appointment; Amber took a look at a couple of pictures of the cut I was interested in; asked me some clarifying questions about what I was looking for in regards to length and texture; and got to work. I get a little antsy when I have to sit a long time for a haircut and I was really impressed with how quick and thorough this cut was! Amber was really friendly; assured me that my hair isn't as thin as my old stylist always described it as (which over time gave me a complex about thinning hair!); and gave me a cut I am so happy with! I think I've found my new regular salon and I can't wait to go back in a few weeks! [REVIEW_7] absolutely my favorite sandwich place!  i LOVE LOVE LOVE Cosi's multigrain bread & LOVE LOVE LOVE their tomato basil soup! absolutely amazing :) i've been here several times & one time i got a free drink ! yayyy employer is very friendly & kind ! [REVIEW_8] I love Tanya & Matt's. I work right around the corner and if it wouldn't make me weigh 800 lbs I would go every single day.   They have an ever-changing selection of flavors. They have a smorgasbord of toppings that you can choose from including these tiny little juice ball things. I haven't tried them yet but they look really intriguing.   I've had cookies and creme; peanut butter and birthday cake. They are all super creamy and delicious. My favorite topping is the cookie dough chunks but they also have a bunch of great fresh fruit.   They have Boba tea; smoothies and milkshakes but I haven't tried those yet.  I recommend going in the first time so you can check out the selection but they also have a drive thru. [REVIEW_9] I can't say enough about this wonderful store. The staff knows you before you even walk in the door. I walked in and bought a $50 bracelet for my mother. They treated me like I was buying the Crown Jewels. The put it in a box with gold leaf that with ribbon. It's then placed in a bag with gold leaf. You feel appreciated and valued.   I stood next to a woman buying a string of pearls worth more than an average new car. Everyone is treated exactly the same.   I've come back time and time again. I've bought watches there. I've bought their ceramic money jars. Every time has been a great experience.   They have a complimentary cookie and beverage bar for customers. They are always their for a quick repair or battery replacement.   This business is one of a kind. [REVIEW_10] Today was my first experience at the new Blue Sage location; which is within a ¼ mile of the old spot; on the opposite side of 2nd Street Pike. The menu remains exciting; offering tastes inspired by many cuisines; all featuring the freshest ingredients. To start; my luncheon companion and I split an order of Tostones--wonderfully crisp wafers of mashed plantain served with a creamy guacamole (the menu says ""avocado relish""). She ordered the Falafel; I went with Pan Bagna. Both were excellent and highly recommended. A few thoughts: today was a frigid day and I wish we had asked to be seated near the fireplace; rather then in the larger main dining room; which was chilly and got a bit loud as it filled. On a more positive note; one of the joys of Blue Sage remains its distinctly non-threatening menu. If you are not a vegetarian; you will not be intimidated by a slew of weird faux-meat dishes; in other words. Instead; you will find a wide variety of extremely tasty dishes very clearly described on the menu. And there's another huge plus: many of the dishes can be ordered dairy free. This is a very kind gesture for those of us who are lactose intolerant. There are even lactose-free desserts; a nearly impossible to find treat!",8
62,"[REVIEW_1] Best Indian around by far. Reasonably priced; good service; clean and great food. Try Ekta vegetables and the lamb korai. Yum! [REVIEW_2] This is hands down the WORST nail salon I have ever been to. It's highly overpriced and my manicure was awful. They filed off my gels instead of scraping; but they weren't careful and they also filed off my skin. I had three bloody fingers on each hand. My nails were uneven-some really thick; some thin; some with bubbles. The gel started peeling off after less than a week. I should have read the reviews before I went!! You are better off doing your nails yourself. [REVIEW_3] Nothing makes my busy day easy like my iced coffee at Starbucks and this location botched it up for me:( see my photo yup those are coffee grinds at the bottom a whole bunch of coffee grinds:( yuck yuck! [REVIEW_4] What a disappointment. This place was not good I would suggest you think twice before selecting this option. The manager and wait staff may possibly be the worst I have ever encountered; rude and definitely not focused on customer service.  The manager is a very angry hostile fella I asked if I could get brown rice instead of white and he blasted me...I offered to pay extra and he stormed off? Do not know what the deal was but this is just plain unprofessional and creepy behavior. The waitresses will smack into you while you are eating...man what a mess this place is from top to bottom. The food just OK at best! I am seriously complimenting them here... you can do better at home than here. Seriously I am not going to go into you have been warned just yuk...OK? these other folks with the positive reviews for this place must burn off their taste buds with adult beverages. (Didn't try the sake it may be the high point of the joint...but why would I want to expose my taste buds to a substandard meal to enjoy some rice wine? I can do this at home.  Here is something I am not sure of; I have only lived here a few months now; is it customary to charge for each soda every time you get a refill here? I was charged for each I asked why they said ""This is how we do it here."" So at $2 bucks per 6-8 ounces of beverage you may want to go with water at this place...but smarter yet! Go elsewhere. I will not be returning to this establishment.  Worst yet. [REVIEW_5] I've been going to Body Cycle for about a year! The instructors are AWESOME; they work hard to know who you are and provide an amazing workout.  I go three times a week and get my ass kicked everytime and I am in the best shape of my life.  The classes are scheduled such that even the busiest of people are able to get to a class. [REVIEW_6] The hotel room service is terrible cause they skimp on shampoos; conditioners;body lotions;tissue and on the toilet paper .You would think they want to keep the customers happy;well they're very cheap on everything. My sheets and towels are often stained. I booked the hotel for the week; and spending the alot of money on my vacation this will never be the hotel I'll ever stay at.Thats a feed back toward better service for the future customers! [REVIEW_7] Zio's is honestly one of my favorite pizza places in Philadelphia. For anyone from NY/NJ; it's one of the few places you could get classic pies like they make over the bridge. Sandwiches; pastas; salads and appetizers are all pretty good too. Staff has always been very friendly and treat us well when we eat in. [REVIEW_8] Very poor service; very greasy pizza. The pizza I ordered didn't even have the same toppings as described in the menu.  The table was never wiped; the food sat for several minutes in view before it was delivered.  The table next to us had dirty dishes on it almost the whole time.  I think everything else in the Indianapolis airport is better. [REVIEW_9] We tried Zorba's for the first time last weekend; and it was absolutely perfect. It's a charming little spot with AMAZING food. Having tried several greek places in the area; this is my most definitely my favorite. Loved the fact that it's BYOB! We began with the spicy feta dip (the cold one; not the hot one!) and it was very flavorful. An awesome portion for the price.  I had the Artichokes Constantinople as my entrée; and it was FAB. The sauce was tangy; salty; and so satisfying. I can't wait to go back and get them again. My fiancé had some type of meat dish; I really can't remember what- but he loved it. Everything was tender and cooked to perfection. Also; the service was great; friendly; and fast. I can't wait to go back ASAP! [REVIEW_10] I have to admit that this place is a great place for KBBQ. Since there are some slim pickings around this area; this place takes the cake. I didn't wait very long for a table. The staff were very courteous and explained how the menu worked as well as how to best grill the different meats. I also really like how the hoods are part of the grilling area so there's not this bulky hood on top of each table. The sides are very good as well and there's a wide variety of sides there. Can't wait to come back to get my KBBQ fix",5
63,"[REVIEW_1] It's bad. More breading than meat. Frozen Chinese food; it's a cookie cutter pop up Chinese restaurant. [REVIEW_2] Has many beer choices that are only available at bar that were served in unclean glass.  Wine pour was very small for the large price.  Restroom appears to have been cleaned last week my shoes stick for a moment with every step '' heavy pee smell all the way home''  I would go here again if I became a drunk with very low standards. [REVIEW_3] I have eaten here several times during the four years I have lived in Philly; and have had happy hours or cocktail events here as well; as an employee of a company in the building; and I have had wonderful experiences. This is thanks completely to the *servers; bartenders; and kitchen staff*. On Valentine's Day; however; we had a very different experience. I am confident that the servers and kitchen staff were amazing as always; but we never found out. We made our reservation about a month and a half early; to ensure a window seat. OpenTable asked for a credit card when booking--no problem; we provided it. Upon arrival; we were told that; since we did not place a deposit; there was not a table for us. Yes; they could see our reservation in the system; they said; they can see the date on which we placed the reservation; a month and a half prior. However; they claim to have called us (one time) to get a deposit from us; and since they were unsuccessful; they didn't hold us a table (again; they can see our reservation; they knew we were coming).  **No one had ever called to obtain a deposit from us.**  Further; had they needed a deposit; that should have been worked out between OpenTable and R2L--not our problem. OpenTable asked for a credit card and we provided one. Plus; how incredibly rude is it to require a deposit for a table reservation anyway? As a semi-regular at this place I find that greatly offensive. We weren't speaking with hourly-waged youngsters either; we started with a manager and were escalated to ""one of the owners"". Neither woman made an attempt to be friendly; let alone apologetic or accommodating in any way.  This lady who was ""one of the owners"" should definitely keep herself exclusively in the back of the house; away from any sort of paying customer.  I have never; as a customer; been treated so poorly or talked to so terribly. And; no; I can assure you; we were not out of line or yelling or making a scene or rude for our part; we just aren't the type. She was plain awful.  Never so much as a shred of an inkling of a hint of an apology or any effort whatsoever.  So; despite all of the rave verbal reviews I have given everyone I know about this place in the past; I will now make sure that everyone we know; meet; work with; or do business with--several of whom work in that building--does not ever drink or dine at R2L.  And; clearly; we will never step foot into the place again either. After leaving; we had an amazing meal with mind-blowing service at DEVON SEAFOOD. Go there instead! [REVIEW_4] So; so disappointed in this place. It used to be great when it first opened; but the past two times I've gone it's been terrible. The experience Villagio offers does not match up with the price of movie tickets; food; beverage; ect. If I'm paying $26 for two tickets; over $12 for food and beverage service then I expect to receive more than 1 star service AND for napkins; utensils; ect.. To be brought out with my meal. The staff looks miserable; no one seems to care about overall customer service. [REVIEW_5] Service and management terrible... After messing up all 4 of our orders the waiter got mad and started cursing... The manager offered our drinks to be free.. What a mess. The food was cold and nasty didn't even eat half of it and waited over an hour... I will never dine in any cracker barrel again after this experience... [REVIEW_6] Possibly the best breakfast sandwich EVER.  On a biscuit!  Oh my gosh; it was so good! [REVIEW_7] Waiter brought me a plate with yellowish stream of food. I asked for a clean plate. He returned what appeared to be the same plate with a greasy streak. It appears as though the places was wiped. My husband then asked for another plate. He brought another plate and said it was handwashed 3 times. I didn't trust the waiter after the second plate. [REVIEW_8] Made an appointment on line at 12:30 on a Sunday for 2 pm They claim they do same day service. Ride up there and am told ""it's better to call because then they can see if the guys who do diagnostics are in."" They were not there. Really? I posted in the appointment comments what the problem was (why not notify me you can't do the work before I drive there in a car that may brake down) and what mechanic can't run a diagnostic? Doesn't the machine do it for you? Clowns and jokers  Stay away. Lying lumps of crap. [REVIEW_9] Come here to have drinks made by a bartender who doesn't care about the integrity of their craft!  What seems like a great cocktail program executed by amateurs. Came in the evening of 01/01/18 and ordered a drink that was a floral riff on the Last Word. After straining my drink into the glass; my bartender exchanged baffled looks with his barback and poured gin directly into the glass. I'm not stupid; so I asked what the ingredient was and why he added it after the fact. ""It's lavender Gin and I didn't put enough."" Well; my friend; this resulted in an improperly diluted and room temperature 'cocktail'. I even mentioned that it was not as cold as it should have been and the solution was to add ice to my coupe glass. COME ON. At what point is it appropriate to ask to jump behind the bar and just make your drink yourself?  Just because half the people in NoLA don't know the difference between a good drink and a hole in the ground isn't an excuse to be lazy. Do it right or go home. [REVIEW_10] We made reservations; and were seated upstairs about a foot from the band at a table that seemed more like a bar table. After sitting for 45 min with NO SERVICE; just empty glasses and silverware; we left. While leaving the host kindly insisted to grab the manager after we told her what happened. (The hosts were wonderful!)   The manager did nothing besides essentially say that this wasn't typical and to come back.",1
64,"[REVIEW_1] If you order a salad; be carful for the ingredients.. I found bacon; Spanish in my Fuji Apple salad.. And they did not add the blue cheese... They mess up the general taste of the plate.. [REVIEW_2] One of the worst service experience. I ordered egg roll and the pho. Egg rolls came out covered with burn crumbles all over and very drak color of the shell and you could the content pretty much black color as if it was almost burned or at the least fried in the last drop of over used burned oil and I could not posssibly put it in my mouth. When I was explaining that Im concerned things are too burned; the owner lady walked up and snatched the plate away from me without saying anything. I did not know if they ate bringing another one or not. Only after I grabbed my waiter later he said they are not making another one ans would take it off my check.  Absolutely rude; not communicating; disrespectful of their customers..  the only reason I came was because the neighboring miss saigoin restaurant was flooded but I think it's worth a wait compared to this place if I want to spend any money for pho and walk out feeling happy :( [REVIEW_3] We paid $230 per night for our stay during the Memorial Weekend and man how I wish I stayed at Motel 6 at next door instead. The location is prime - walkable to tons of cute little restaurant and even Whole Foods. However; the room was way too shabby - we can hear very loud TV noise from our neighbor rooms clearly; no mini fridge; the arrangement of furnitures was disfunctioning; only two table lamps in the entire room; including one doesn't even work; and the dark light makes the room more creepy.. The breakfast was similar quality to their room - very limited choice and low quality GMO products.  You probably can understand my disappointment knowing the price I paid now! [REVIEW_4] Food is expensive and not worth it. My hubby had carnitas - very dry. I had the scallops- expensive and undercooked. Not even a browned crust. Rice was served ""family style "" but do mushy and overlooked. I had a mango margarita that was completely bland and flavorless. We will not be going back. City fish was not good; but this is worse. And so disappointing- the idea of fresh quality Mexican food could have been so good. [REVIEW_5] Maybe it's cool but the asshole out behind the X-ray machine; total misogynist; made a huge deal about the pocket knife in my purse and kicked us out even though I offered nicely to have him keep it up front with him. Thanks for proving yet again that America is made of disagreeable; awfully small people. This economy is as much of a wreck as this museum. [REVIEW_6] This is one of the WORST venues I've been too and definitely won't be coming back. I came here over the weekend to see Primus and I was so disappointed in both the layout of the place and the people that worked there. First the security at the door was confused; they took our tickets and then walked back in the place; leaving us outside. When he finally decided to return he actually asked us for our tickets (even though he took them with him). After rummaging through his pockets...tada! He found them and finally let us in.  We were escorted upstairs to the bar & restaurant where we were told they were out of food menus and they would give us one when it came available...so that's when the waiting game began. We waited about 10 minutes for a menu and then it took about 15 minutes for someone to circle back around and take our order. After placing our order it took them over 30 minutes to make one chicken caesar wrap. Once we finally got our food they proceed to ""kick us out"" because they needed to get the top floor ready for the show - so frustrating! The night continued to go just as frustrating. The layout of this place is rectangular and very long so if you don't get there early and man your spot; good looking getting a glimpse at the stage. They cram over 1000 people in this small club and if it wasn't for the TV screens people would have missed the show entirely. I feel horrible for about 70% of the people that came to watch the show; there is really no good seat in the house. Also their security is absolutely horrible; they were constantly rushing through the crowds to stop people from smoking or taking pictures. When they weren't shoving you to get through they were shining a flashlight in your eyes. We also had security shove us out of the way so he could stand in front of us and take video himself of the band that was playing. They are so unprofessional and rude. If you plan on going to see a show here; I wouldn't recommend it especially if there's going to be a lot of people and a sold-out show because chances are you won't see anything. And I'm serious when I say it that only about 30% of the ticket holders could see anything; the rest of us were just standing around watching the TV screens. This place is super lame and I won't ever be back. [REVIEW_7] De vacaciones y sin ganas de cocinar; decidimos (x8) pedir pizzas en este lugar para retirar y comer en el lugar en el que nos estábamos hospedando; que quedaba a 500 metros. Así que; un jueves de verano; las fuimos a buscar cerca de las 21.30 horas. Entramos y nos pareció muy ameno; limpio y confortable para comer ahí. Nos atendió un hombre muy amable y atento. Pedimos los siguientes sabores: - prosciutto (jamón crudo); - ham (jamón cocido); - pepperoni; - cebolla; - hongos; - anchoas y - albahaca y tomate.  Las pizzas tardaron 25/30 minutos. Todos sus gustos -de los cuales subo foto- estuvieron deliciosos. El estilo de pizza fue a la piedra; con salsa de tomate y queso muzzarela en una cantidad ideal. Si bien este comentario parece limitarse únicamente a una estricta relación precio-calidad; no menos verdad es que; en mi opinión; la calidez con la que fuimos recibidos reflejó cómo hubiera sido el trato de haber decidido cenar ahí mismo. No dudo en valorar a este lugar con cinco estrellas. [REVIEW_8] We live in the neighborhood and have eaten here many times. I feel as if this restaurant is going downhill. This time we were there for dinner early on a Sunday. The bathrooms were filthy. There are 2 and one was not usable due to all of the paper towels that had been put into the toilet (there was no toilet paper). The other one was usable but also no toilet paper. Our server; Ashley; was not interested in providing any semblance of customer service...RUDE! We had a simple question about the beers on special and she became quite defensive. My daughter spilled her drink; which I realize is a pain in the ass for the restaurant and server (although we were outside so it wasn't that big a deal). We apologized profusely but she didn't even try to hide her annoyance. Finally; the chicken quesadilla should have been labeled the gristle quesadilla....more fat than actual meat...yuck. We love the proximity of this place to where we live and it was great in the past but not anymore...will likely not return...not with so many better quality restaurants in Northern Liberties and Fishtown. [REVIEW_9] Food frozen with taste of freezer burn. Over priced for what you get. Nothing interesting everything is average food that can be purchased anyplace else for less money.  Love the interior everything else under average. [REVIEW_10] Wish I would have came on Yelp and read the previous reviews; it would've saved me a lot of time and frustration. I ran in today to see if someone could take a look at my right passenger front wheel. My tire pressure light was on and I noticed a piece of tire was lifted. I go in and he tells me it's a couple hours wait. Ok; I'll give you that I just showed up so the wait thing is to be expected. I ask the guy if I can make an appointment to come back. He says its first come first serve. Really? When I've made appts previously with other Just Tires? Why not just say you don't want my service? Bottom line? Guy was rude and lacked any customer service. Went down the street to Mr. Tire and was in and out with a replaced new tire in half an hour. Oh; and they appeared WAY busier based on the waiting area and cars in the garage.",1
65,"[REVIEW_1] I totally love the steak & eggs with the breakfast potatoes and melon mule. The service was great and atmosphere was cozy. [REVIEW_2] Everyone told me they had best cheesesteaks. I was skeptical but ordered pn with a salad. It was  delicous the bread was amazibg abd it wasnt soaked in grease. Salad was fresh and made perfect side. Defiantly recommend you try the cheesteak! [REVIEW_3] Short rib tacos ruled! The sweet potato fries were an awesome starter. Our server Lindsay was amazing. Kept our glasses full the whole time and checked up on us constantly! Good vibe and they had the game on which in the playoffs is always a good thing! I'd go back again! Maybe take mom and dad to this joint! [REVIEW_4] I hadn't had Indian food before going here; and I found out about this place from my brother-in-law's wife who went to the University of Arizona. I'll admit I was a little apprehensive going in the first time; but it was really good every time we went back and we make sure to stop in whenever we're in Tucson.  Tonight; we were craving Indian food and wanted to get out of the Phoenix area for a while. This was the obvious choice. My wife had her usual chicken tikka masala and mango lasse. I had the shrimp masala. We also shared the keema samosas appetizer; made better by the tamarind sauce; some kashmiri rice with some naan. The masala wasn't as spicy as I was expecting when I ordered it at a medium spice; but I'd rather have it be not hot enough than too hot. The masala mixed with the kashmiri rice piled on the naan is like an explosion of flavor that I can't get enough of.   The atmosphere isn't too Americanized; nor is it cheesy over-the-top Indian - it's just right. The music that they pipe in isn't too loud; and it's really enjoyable. The service is always quick and friendly. The restaurant itself is smaller; but instead of feeling like a sardine in a tin can; it feels cozy. This is one of the few places my wife and I are willing to drive 2 hours just to have dinner at.   If you've never had Indian food and haven't wanted to try it because you've heard it's really spicy; give this place a try (they'll make it as spicy as you like it; even if it's not spicy at all like my wife likes it). You'll be in for a nice surprise. [REVIEW_5] When I discovered a giant yellow jacket nest hidden behind the insulation in my mom's basement over Labor Day Weekend; I looked around in vain for someone that would handle it; until I was googling and came across The Wasp Expert.  I called Chris and he answered immediately; then said he could meet me there on Sunday and would take care of it.  He showed up with his bee suit and equipment and proceeded to carefully and expertly remove the nest; even offering to take extra time to leave it intact (sans yellow jackets!) if I wanted to use it in the K-12 educational setting where I work.  My mom was thrilled because she doesn't like chemicals and is very ecologically-minded and Chris works without chemicals whenever possible.  Even with all the extra time he spent on this particular nest; he still charged an extremely reasonable amount; so little that I offered more for his time and expertise.  The timeliness; communication; excellent customer service; and extensive expertise all combined to make this just an outstanding experience that immediately solved a serious problem; at a very reasonable cost; and I learned a lot about wasps and yellow jackets in the process.  I highly recommend Chris; The Wasp Expert:  just call him if you have any kind of problem with wasps; yellow jackets; or bees. [REVIEW_6] I've gotten my hair cut twice now by Ryan. He was the friendliest and cut my hair exactly has described. I will be returning a third time! [REVIEW_7] Great company - Melanie has made our time as home-owners turned landlords incredibly easy. We are going on our second year using Synergy; and Melanie; as our property managers and would recommend them to friends and family.  Thanks!  -Matt​ [REVIEW_8] I love this place!  The side dishes come out fast; and they are very fresh.  The service is good too.  For the amount of food you get; you can't beat the price.  $10 for the most yummy tofu stew. [REVIEW_9] Who knew I would lives grocery store so much! I've been to a few publix grocery stores before but this one is by far the best one! They have an awesome deli section that has a wide selection of everything! I love that they have 10+ different types of hummus! What grocery store gives you that much variety? Exactly no other LOL! But there's also a ton of different salads; chicken salads; potatoe salads; salsa; etc...just so much! I love this store [REVIEW_10] My friend and I travel to St. Louis for a concert at Delmar Hall. This restaurant was right across from the venue and a perfect place to grab a bite before getting in line for the show.   Our waitress was incredibly nice and was very quick to check on us and take our order.  We shared a 12"" thin crust with bacon and ricotta and it may have been one of the best pizzas we both have had.   Only weird thing was the fact that their was absolutely no lighting in the bathroom. This only mattered a wee bit because my friend and I tried to reaply a little bit of make up before heading to the concert. But it worked out and we were fine.   Overall; would come here again; next time I'm in St. Louis.",10
66,"[REVIEW_1] If you want a hamburger or steak this isn't your joint.  So going to Pita Jungle was not my choice but my soon to be in-law's choice.  The patio is great to sit outside when it gets cooler out; it's laid back atmosphere is very much vegan- tree hugger.  I guess If you like veggies and healthy stuff this is your place to go. Personally me I'm a meat and potato type of gal who isn't your typical ""I'll order a salad and water""   The prices are very reasonable and from what others ordered it appeared the deep friend cauliflower was amazing. [REVIEW_2] Still waiting for the gift card apology that was promised. Maybe their oversight or just a comment on Yelp! to make customer service appear better.  It has been almost 6 months and still no gift card. Customer service not a priority here. [REVIEW_3] So I went to this location because I had the feeling that this location would not try to get over and be perfectly honest...I went there for a noise in my steering wheel. They told me they didn't find anything wrong. So I picked my car up; noise still there. I pointed it out they put it right up and told me it was my rack pinon  costing around $1;500 -$1;800 dollars with labor; parts; etc. Mind you I just brought my car probably three weeks ago. I said scratch that and took it to the Hyundai dealer and got the car fully inspected. I did not; I repeat did not need a new rack and pinon!!!! It was my coupler or however you spell it in the steer wheel that was worn out. Want to know how much it cost me? $0.00 under warranty. Now if I was naive I would have handed over that money to Pep Boys for no reason. I don't know if they were trying to take advantage because I am a woman but I wasn't for it. I won't be returning because of the misinformation. Nice customer service though! That's not enough. [REVIEW_4] A friend of mine recommended this restaurant when i told him i would be in new Orleans. I went with a group of friends with high expectations. Since we were 7 we waited for more than an hour to get seated; which we took in good stride we just sat somewhere outside and chatted. When we were finally seated; it took the them about 15 minutes to come and take our orders and then...the ordeal started; the waiter told one of my friends to hurry up and order(he had just delivered the menus) or he will go and serve another table. There were about 4 of us on the table who had not ordered yet and we asked if he can take our orders first instead while my friend made up his mind but no...he said we had to follow the order we were seated. We let that slide; but then he delivered the drinks in a leaking glass and the food took another hour to come. People who arrived after we were seated had finished eating before we even had our food. Needless to say...the whole experience was so terrible there was nothing special about the food. [REVIEW_5] This review is for the Laura/OakAlley plantation tour. The tours were great but the company can't take any credit. It's the tour guides at the plantation that are So Great!   This company has POOR time management issue!   After being picked up; we waited for about 20min to wait for the other bus to come then about 20 people were transferred to our bus. By the time we really started the tour; it was an hour after the pick up time.   Payment issue - I called about the discount I'll get if I reserve online. The woman told me to do it otherwise I can't get it when paying in person. So I did it. But; then the driver; half way into the tour; said now everyone please line up to pay. He used a tiny portable credit card machine to process everyone's card. It was slow  SLOW! The bus was full that day and it was 90 degrees out. It took him about 45min to get everything done plus he was confused about two groups of people who happened to have the same last name.   Really? It's 2013 people! The company can't take payment online or over the phone?  Why ask your customer to waste valuable time?   Though I had the email proving I've paid online. I was told that it simply reserved my seats and wasn't the actual payment. So paid AGAIN and of course got charged TWICE! It has been over a week and I haven't got the refund.   Because of this delay; when we got to the second plantation; we had about a little over an hour left because the driver said we  must leave at 5.    He told us to go straight to the big house but gave us the WRONG time when the tour would start. So everyone waited about 15 minutes in line AGAIN instead of just enjoying the beautiful garden at Oak Alley. (The tour is boring and the stories aren't interesting. I'd recommend people just spend all the time in the garden) By the time we came out; it was almost time to get on the bus and head back to the French Quarter. So Disapppinting. We didn't get to visit the beautiful Oak Alley at all.    Give me my money back; Cajun Encounter! [REVIEW_6] This is hands down the WORST nail salon I have ever been to. It's highly overpriced and my manicure was awful. They filed off my gels instead of scraping; but they weren't careful and they also filed off my skin. I had three bloody fingers on each hand. My nails were uneven-some really thick; some thin; some with bubbles. The gel started peeling off after less than a week. I should have read the reviews before I went!! You are better off doing your nails yourself. [REVIEW_7] Found this place online as I am traveling across country with my dog. I was assured it was dog friendly and that they would do ""and and everything to accomodate my dog."" I dont expect much. I walked in the front entrance and had 2 servers walk within inches of me by the door and look at me as if i was in the way. I walked to the bar and a really friendly brunette bartender was super friendly. Thats the only high point. The server made it clear that we were a burden; 6 different staff members watched me wait for what i thought was a single person bathroom which turned out to be a 6 stall room. I even asked and they told me to wait. Ive worked in F&B for 16 years. I would fire the entire staff minus the one bartender (black hair; rasta tattoo on her shoulder; rasta necklace on; she was cool.) and get this place in shape. what a shame......not to mention the rare tuna panini was beyond well done; nothing like a canned tuna panini and shitty; rude service. [REVIEW_8] Staff member wouldn't let us use guest pass on our first time there. He said our only option was to buy at least a one day pass for $15/person. LOL. Went to Retro fitness for free trial; better equipment and environment:) [REVIEW_9] As much as I adore food I am; typically; pretty easy when it comes to food and I forgive a lot. SO...one star means a lot! I haven't been as livid as I was leaving this fiasco of a restaurant in a long while. Reasons:  The server was on her cell phone from the minute we walked in to the minute we walked out (about 90 minutes). She literally had it on her shoulder the entire time except to say; ""Please hold"" to take our orders. She was also the chef and cooked while talking on her bloody phone; as well. Service:  FAIL. My pork leg was tender and good which constitutes the lonely little star you see above. My husband ordered the shrimp; which cost $18.99. He received 7 shrimp that would be in a bag of 31-35 count...the size worthy of a salad shrimp. Again; $18.99...and the plantain portion of the meal consisted of 2 plantains the width of a postage stamp. Ridiculous. I then ordered tostones because I knew he would never be full with that quantity of food. I had to get up and find our server to add to my order as she was nowhere to be found.  They were also ridiculously thin; were over salted with an almost breaded and deep fried consistency. Food:  FAIL. I was going to order a Cuban coffee but the server was so non-existent that I just gave up; finally.  In retrospect; I'm happy I didn't order it because I'm sure it would have been just wrong. I would not frequent this restaurant again even if I had a free coupon. Don't waste your time or energy. [REVIEW_10] I went here today because all week I've been experiencing swelling in my wrists; neck; face; achiness and burning in my arm; and generally not feeling right. I did the usual paperwork; had to pay up front; which had I been able to pay afterwards. I probably would have left and gone to Lankenau. So; the MA who came in and asked me questions was cool; personable.... My blood pressure was insanely high; which I have never experienced before (168 over 135) and I got panicky; as the alarms and crap were dinging;... The MA definitely recognized my concern; and listened pretty well.  The Dr came in and I went  thru my list of symptoms and he totally blew me off; I  said even the fact my blood pressure was sky high wasn't a bit alarming;....He said no; I have anxiety. Made me out to be a hypochondriac; which totally isn't the case; I've fallen off rooftops and walked junk off like the queen of england. He then asks are you tired...Yeah I'm tired ; I work full time in a hospital and waitress part time; and I walk like a million miles a day; but I feel crappy now more so than usual.   He palpates my belly and asks a few more questions; then says well I think you may have mono.... But there isn't much we can do about that.... I asked if he could run an epstien barr heterophile blood test to see...He said it wasn't neccesary. Um....Ok. ""Tthere isnt much that we can do about that anyway""... Great. He says I strained my wrist. I'll get you an ace bandage....Well what about the mono possibility....ande the fact my blood pressure was insanely high....Once again he gives me this look like listen you dirty little tattooed hood rat...you have no idea what your talking about..... ""Your a perfectly healthy twenty seven year old. Your fine. You have anxiety problems; you checked off depression on your chart....."" Um. Ok. So I then wait half an hour for an ace bandage while the chick runs around bitching how they don't have any supplies; never can get anything done....(reassuring) I mean; to be fair; I probably could have gotten a better physical at my apartment considering I have a broken wheelchair;a blood pressure cuff; a buncha vacutainers; some cough syrup; and part of a trach tool kit (don't ask me and my brother work in healthcare;....and kinda hoard stuff...) So I finally get my ace bandage and ask the girl if she can take my blood pressure...SHe says she can't find a stethescope. I ask a dr passing by if he can and he pretty much laughs in my face. ""Aren't you leaving?""  Um; ok. ""why do you want your blood pressure checked?"" ""Because it was insanely high when I came in on the machine; and I was hoping a manual read would prove different"" So; in less than good humor; he pretends like he's checking my pressure (I know how to use a blood pressure cuff; he didn't set it on the right numbers or place the stethescope in the correct area....) He says  ""It's like 110 over 90. Why; do you feel ok?"" Whatta mess. For the record; my brother and boyfriend took my pressure; it's still high; and now I'm out 70 bucks and all I got was a steam punk piece of junk arm brace that I'll probably be wearing in a casket judging by these reviews.",0
67,"[REVIEW_1] Jambalaya; gator sausage; and beignets are phenomenal.  We just can't find jambalaya this good for miles and miles around.  Thrilled to have them here. [REVIEW_2] My group of 6 all got burgers and were very satisfied. Very clean and nice place. Sweet potato tots are a must. [REVIEW_3] Before buying any furniture for our new home in Tucson; we shopped around. We actually shopped around too much; visiting 20+ furniture stores in the area.  Hands DOWN discount mattress barn was the cheapest.   Steve personally set up my bar stools on one visit; and made 100% sure it was assembled level. And on another loaded my extra large ottoman into my van all by himself.  By purchasing from Discount Mattress Barn; you get so much more than just the best value. You get amazing customer service!! [REVIEW_4] The diner was extremely busy and the waitresses were being pushed to their limits.  The problem was the kitchen; obviously; when the food came it was dry and overdone; the sides came later; the desert was not cooked(rice pudding).  The waitress did offer another choice and we will see how that is later as after being there over 1 hr we brought home.  The owners or managers only seem to care if a substitute was made and who was your server but not that the kitchen staff is being overworked with this crowd and cannot be attentive to their cooking when being pushed like this.  The first manager pushed me to second manager and they really don't seem to care as long as they can push the crowd to fill the tables.  A few waitresses heard my complaints and thanked me as they said they have been trying to tell them this too.  Well; that is my last visit here as I would rather go up the street to a smaller diner (Club Diner) and get a better meal and more attentive staff. [REVIEW_5] Excellent food atmosphere and service . Everything was fresh and hot when we were served ;and the dessert tray is absolutely amazing!  We walked here from our hotel ( Hotel Monaco) and are so glad we did! Bon Appetito!! [REVIEW_6] Pulled pork and fried fish are great.    Don't miss the sweet tea.  My wife had the white beans and cold slaw really good much better than my Mac and cheese and potatoe salad.    But a must eat if you love bbq. [REVIEW_7] My parents and I ate here Saturday night. The fish was very fresh. I got salmon; yellowtail; okra; and eel. And mom got the Korean BBQ ribs which she loved. The service was speedy and attentive. Great spot for sushi! I'll definitely be back. [REVIEW_8] This is one of the oldest Italian restaurant's in the entire country. It's a three floor restaurant all well maintained. Parking was really difficult for me as I ended up driving around for a Realllllllly long time as it's all street parking. They do offer valet parking after a certain hour. Also reservations are recommended although I don't think they're mandatory. The service was stellar as was my wife's manicotti  (stellar as in heavenly. ) Anyway let's take a look at my own meal...  Ralph's Famous Veal Parmesan   What Is It: It's pretty much your traditional chicken parm only with veal instead of chicken. The veal is crusted with the parmesan; topped with mozzarella; and covered in sauce. Spaghetti with sauce as well as pre entree bread is also served.  Presentation: Definitely looks the part even though they plated the spaghetti separate from the veal probably because they give you such a big piece of veal. Nevertheless it looks tremendous.  9 out of 10  Taste/Final Analysis: With this being one of their signature dishes I had to try this out. This also was my first experience of eating veal. I'm pretty sure this probably wasn't the best way to get a first taste of it as it's covered up with so many other flavours. Now that's not to say that this wasn't a delicious dish because it was. Their sauce in particular should be its own food group it was that good. The veal was crispy and delicious just like a proper parmesan dish. My problem was that it was pretty much identical to a chicken parmesan. The texture; the taste; everything was exactly like a chicken parmesan.  I'm not sure what the uniqueness of having it as ""veal"" parmesan is. Like I said this is a tasty dish but  you might as well get the cheaper chicken parm. The restaurant is definitely worth checking out for both a great meal and experiencing a piece of American history. Just either give yourself plenty if time to park or arrive during their valet parking time.  Veal Parmesan: Chicken Parmesan out of 10 Which is a 9 out of 10 [REVIEW_9] The ultimate place to stay in Nashville.  I have been fortuate to stay there twice.  Seems a little overwhelming at first with its sheer size you could get lost; but the staff is really helpful and they have maps all around.  The restuarants run the gambit from moderately priced to expensive.  All have great food. [REVIEW_10] This place is a scam. They serve drinks where you do not taste the alcohol. The bartenders complain about the tip you leave. I've never been to a bar that is so disrespectful to customers. I will never go there again bunch of young kids with no class. Place will be closed in 6 months.",8
68,"[REVIEW_1] First off. let me say I have not eaten at this restaurant.  I went in to simply pick up a menu so that I could order from home and go pick up my meal.    Upon walking into the restaurant; I stood by the counter/register and waited for someone to come to the front.  A woman walked up from the back of the place and said; ""ya"".  I asked for a to-go menu; received one and left.  I perused the menu in the car and noticed they seen to be priced higher than many other Indian places in the Nashville area.    Sorry; but ""ya"" is not how I prefer to be greeted.  Like I said; I have not eaten at this restaurant.  After this brief encounter; I will not do so.  Also; I find it very interesting that the most recent positive reviews of this restaurant are from folks with Indian names who live in other states. [REVIEW_2] MY review is based on the sales department. The service department is AMAZING and are not relevant to this score. Also; Richard (aka Michael) at Ray Brandt was AMAZING. Great guy and made my test-driving experience one of the best! Unfortunate that the lease deal (that was not in his control) was nowhere close to honest or accurate.   BACKSTORY: Returning a VW Jetta lease just days before my lease is up. Went to Ray Brandt first (and did not just deal with one person; I dealt with 3+ not including Richard) because I initially leased from them and ended up running for the door. Called Southpoint VW immediately after and I have no words for how awesome they were. I'm just going to explain the difference between Southpoint VW and Ray Brandt VW:  RAY BRANDT: I am not in this ""90 day period"" to return my car so they will have to do me a PERSONAL favor and take the hit of my return fee and minor scratches (that added up to $1;300 btw). Meaning it was no longer an incentive for me to return my car; it was a personal favor I should be thankful for.  THEN on my quote print out.. there re-appears the $1;300! They snuck it back in my price thinking I would not notice and tried to cover up with some story about taking it out of my ""discount"" (but I followed what they were saying; and it indeed was a deception)  SOUTPOINT: No such thing as ""90 day period"".. I was leasing another VW; therefore they did not even care to inspect my car. I hand it in as is (assuming I had my 4 doors and bumper of course!).  --------- RAY BRANDT: I wanted the black Tiguan and I had to pay $200 transportation cost to get it from another dealer  SOUTHPOINT: No only did they pick up the black Tiguan from another dealer 100 miles away; they drove it all the way from Baton Rouge to my WORK! NO CHARGE! --------- RAY BRANDT: Expected I pay 70% of the MSRP in 36 months. WHAT?!?! and they had no explanation (except for jargon) when I asked three times for the break down and how that makes sense to THEM.   SOUTHPOINT: Paying 35% MSRP in 36 Months. BEFORE negotiation -------  RAY BRANDT: Any and all incentives (that I knew about beforehand) were now personal favors. Told me the price break-down print out was something they ""don't show people""!  Ok; only every other dealership I visited before showed me the print out WITHOUT that fancy line. I give my social; birthday; salary; credit history; and address... I think I more than deserve to know the details of my future car!   SOUTHPOINT: Gave max incentives; honored all deals online; adjusted discount to make whatever I put down still in ratio with other deals for down-payment promos that I wasnt participating in; wrote off $$ on contract based on negotiated prices we had talked about. Gave me all information and price details upfront.  ---------  RAY BRANDT: Jacked the MSRP price $1;200 more than market price claiming when the car comes from Germany it's a bit lower but once it gets to dealership they add things such as ""felt trunk separator"" and the ""first aid kit"" that factors the price higher. AGAIN... WHAT?!! hah!  SOUTHPOINT: MSRP was $4;000 lower than RAY BRANDT  (SAME EXACT CAR). Mind you- it's not actually ""lower"".. this IS the price of the car.  -------  RAY BRANDT: $467/month $1;000 down for basic factory standard Tiguan S 2016 (please look up so you can laugh that I could lease an AUDI for that much).   SOUTHPOINT: $256/month $0 down. SAME TIGUAN S 2016!!  -------  RAY BRANDT: Only saw me as easy $$$ and an ignorant consumer  SOUTHPOINT:  Respected me AND my wallet. They did EVERYTHING to make my experience as convenient as possible; honestly and ethically.   --------  Even if Ray Brandt dealership gave me a deal I couldn't resist; I still wouldn't be able to sign the contract because I don't trust them. [REVIEW_3] My experience here was all around very positive. My waitress was extremely attentive and helpful; from explaining many menu items individually and catering to our table as if we were the only ones there.   I ordered the nachos and Mexican corn as my appetizers. The nachos came in huge portions and very stuffed with cheese; jalapeños etc. So delicious! The Mexican corn was very flavorful and not too spicy; which I really appreciated.  The table came with complimentary chips and salsa which was very light and appropriate before starting the meal. A nice touch. Chips could've been more salty but overall everything was still fine as the salsa gave good flavor.  I ordered the enchiladas which were a bit too bean-y for my taste.   Great service and nice; clean atmosphere. Food is terrific. I would definitely recommend! [REVIEW_4] Below average Chinese food priced accordingly. This is fine but the front counter lady is among the rudest I have ever dealt with. Unwelcoming and cold is putting it lightly. The House Special is fine if you're struggling with the base of Maslow's hierarchy pyramid; otherwise don't bother. [REVIEW_5] I don't know if you can see it from the pic I uploaded but there's sauce covered straws; hair; crumbs and red soda all over the table they sat us at. I asked the waitress to clean it up. She wouldn't. We left before getting our food. Super gross. [REVIEW_6] A perfect afternoon in the gulch for me would consist of a shopping spree at Blush; a beer at Hops and Crafts and lunch at Turnip Truck.  I mean sure it's an interesting grocery store; but have you tried their ever rotating hot buffet or their made to order sandwiches?  Tasty!! Or how about some of their all natural beauty products and lip balms? Score!!  You could spend half a day perusing aisle upon aisle of organic fair. This place makes Whole Foods look like Walmart.   My only complaint: I just wish they would bring back a rewards program of some sort. Guess it was fun while it lasted.   My usual lunch order; chipotle chicken salad wrap on whole wheat with chipotle mayo. [REVIEW_7] I would use all the ink in Yelps pen to compliment this establishment.  This is a perfect example of price balance; speedy / accurate / polite service; hard working cooks; cleaner silverware than Sam Witches and Such; and good food.  The special for under $3 M-F is 2 eggs with your choice of hashbrowns and toast or a list of other sides.  I've tried this with grits; hashbrowns; pancakes; biscuits and gravy; white toast; and bacon - all are absolutely perfectly cooked and served to you in less than 5 minutes.  These are the fastest cooks I've seen.  The waitresses are fast and polite; not overbearing.  This brings me to a delicate situation:  I ALWAYS TIP THEM MORE THAN 40% AND I RECOMMEND YOU DO TO.  Allow me to explain:  I happily tip just over 20% at Sullivans and Flemmings; even with a bottle of Symmetry by Rodney Strong; when the service is good.  I tip over 20% when the service is good at any restaurant.  If I tip 20% here; the waitress get 60 cents = no bueno.  She runs around for a heck of a lot more than that.  (In fact; I donate 60 cents every day to a child in another country that I don't even know).    So; I usually tip between 50 - 100% of the check here; and I implore you - if they give you good service; consider it please.  Back to the review...A+++ on Ebay; thumbs up from Siskel and Ebert and 5 Stars on Yelp.  Check them out if you haven't; impossible to top for breakfast. [REVIEW_8] The Morning Cuban. It could be renamed ""Gout on a Plate;"" but HOLY $H!T is this open faced breakfast sandwich good. It comes on a thick slice of toasted bread (the type they use for french toast); with roasted pulled pork; swiss cheese; ham; 2 fried eggs on top; with a generous portion of house green salsa slathered over the top; creating a moat of not-too-spicy green goodness. Holy sh!t. This makes me think of ""the morning after"" breakfast after partying in Miami's South Beach with some bangin Cuban honeys. Yes; it's like THAT. This sh!t is soooo bomb. I kept muttering expletives to myself as I dug through the plate with my fork. Damnnnn.  Actually; even better than the ""normal"" Morning Cuban... if you ask for a small cup of their House Chorizo Gravy; that's even better with the openfaced Morning Cuban than the green house salsa.   Oh; speaking of house; they were playing some nice jazzy/soulful house music while I was there. Pretty nice for atmosphere. They alternated between the jazzy house and bossa nova music while I was there. I wasn't sure if it was a mix from their private collection; or if it was just Pandora.   Either way; big ups for good tasting food and good taste in music.  The peanut butter brownies are good; but the rest of the baked goods didn't interest me. I think 5th St Bakehouse's strength lies not in the baked goods; but in their awesome sandwiches like the Morning Cuban. In fact; I want to go there right now! [REVIEW_9] Karaoke is wonderful!!!!! They need more women's restrooms. One stall is not enough to have the traffic they have. It's quite ridiculous!!! Have respect for the customers you serve!! Close your doors if you can't renovate! [REVIEW_10] My hair is very thin and it is hard to find anyone to put the micro beads in my hair tight enough and the weave bar are far most the best ones so far and if a few get loose I just go in and they do it for me. I love my extentions and I am glad I found them!!! My daughter loves them as well...she comes all they way from Kutztown!!",5
69,"[REVIEW_1] The best soon-dubu in the city!  This place is tucked away and once you walk in; it's like you've stepped into a Korean home.  Very welcoming; warm and inviting.  It's very vegetarian friendly!  The soft tofu is stewed and put into the dol sot pots which each and every stew feels like it's custom made for you.   You can select from beef; seafood or mixed meats (seafood & beef); mushroom; and just plain.  They can adjust the spice as needed too.  I always get the extra hot with the hot temperature; can't beat it.  The rice also comes in a dol-sot which is great if you leave it in for a while; it burns the rice into a nice crispy shell.  DROOL.  Just thinking about this place makes my mouth salivate!    If you're not into tofu; they also offer korean bbq meats (cooked in the back); with other soup/stew items.  Love this place!!! [REVIEW_2] The site's web states it closes at 12:30; however; we went at 10:37p....and they were closed. [REVIEW_3] This is the worst Taco Bell there is; and sadly; the only one open past 10; and sometimes 9 depending on how the others feel that day. I guess it's just a Nevada thing; or a Reno thing; but the Taco Bell's here are a joke and this is the worst. Been sitting in the drive-thru for 10 minutes only to be told the item I wanted isn't offered anymore; even though commercials are still playing for it. They've forgotten our food more than once; and I personally won't eat here (wife is the hopeful for it because she loves Taco Bell) because it's given us both food poisoning.  Go to Del Taco; same food poisoning; but you'll actually get your food in a timely manner; probably. [REVIEW_4] Bailey was a great piercer; very friendly and knowledgeable! Would definitely recommend coming here [REVIEW_5] Love this place.  Best view in Santa Barbara.   Awesome wines.  My wife and I are industry; and always treated great.  Tom and Gillian are ALWAYS generous hosts.  My wife works @carrwinery and always refers customers to them.  The Conway cabs are the best SB has to offer.  One of their tasting room employees just gifted us a Conway 13 reserve Syrah.  Beautiful. ...  Thank you Tommy.   Rolos red is a bottle that any wine snob would love;  but a great bottle for those finding their pallet as well.  My son is 5 and always wants mom and dad to go wine tasting when we hit the pier. Never disappointed. [REVIEW_6] I have lived here for 8 months and have never been so infuriated by an apartment complex. I've been living in apartments for 15 years. They are way overpriced; too many hidden fees; apartments are old and poorly maintained. Apartment was dirty when I moved in. Carpets were not cleaned and walls not painted. Looks great on the outside. Are currently painting the buildings. I have had ongoing maintenance issues. I call on A/C every 3 to 4 weeks; malfunctioning smoke detectors; broken door lock; broken washer and hot water coming out if the cold water faucets. Nothing is ever resolved. Staff are pleasant but resolve nothing. Corporate is useless. I was advised they aren't there to resolve resident issues but were there for the shareholders. This is not my first experience with a Camden property but it will be my last.  There is a very detailed review dated May of 2015 regarding fees on apartment ratings.com. I would encourage all to read it. Every word us true. There are so many great Apartments in Tampa. Don't  choose this one!!!!!!!! [REVIEW_7] Just got home from my LONG drive to Philadelphia PA. I had a house full of guests  and the general consensus for dinner was island cuisine. Unfortunately; I forgot that this is the Penn Relay weekend (huge mistake). After driving 1.5 hour and taking 30 minutes to find a $15 parking space; I finally arrived. The place was not too packed but half the patrons were gathered around the ordering counter. It took me a few minutes to realize that this increadibly roudy; vulgar bunch had aready placed their orders but were just hanging out at the counter; thus preventing newly arrived customers from placing their orders. I tried my best to get noticed and to get to the counter but had no luck. Ultimately; I and a few other customers (or should I say ""potential customers"" eventually gave up and left. The cincher for me was that the staff were clearly aware of what was occurring but made no attempt to control the crowd. I may have waited if the staff showed some business savvy and kept the counter area clear but unfortunately; they appeared overwhelmed and confused. i've eaten at the Jerk Hut several times (food is OK-good) but this visit left a bad taste in my mouth so I may have to reconsider future trips across the bridge for authentic JA CUISINE!! PS: Memo from prior visits; their wait staff can be a bit rude. [REVIEW_8] At 6:03pm; the PSTA Driver sped through the Marina; not even bothering to slow down to pickup the Passengers; which there were 9 Passengers waiting. That Driver (a White Guy; just to narrow it down) should be Fired Immediately! [REVIEW_9] Came for all-you-can-eat; and ended up waiting for over half an hour to get our order in. The servers completely ignored us; while taking orders from the tables around us. And on top of that; all of the rolls contain ""extras"" not listed on the menu. One roll surprised us by having sweet mustard sauce on it; which did NOT taste very good.... On the bright side; once we actually got our orders in they didn't take all that long to make them. [REVIEW_10] Went for a round of golf Oct 14. First off; they were re-seeding; so it's understandable that the course was under 'duress'. The price was $29; you could not drive a cart off the path; the fairways looked great; obviously soaked in water for the over seeding; and the greens were effectively sand mats. To start they placed a single behind our party of 4 so we immediately had to let the individual behind us play through. All of this was fine until the sprinklers began pumping water into our round. Again; I know that they were over seeding; but we and many others were on the course when sprinklers kicked into full swing behind; ahead; and on top of us. Literally; we were surprise sprayed by popping sprinklers. Let's be clear here; I am not a professional greens keeper; and I do not claim to be an expert in watering of grass in a desert environment; but when people are playing through the course I feel it's fair that the sprinklers are monitored to allow their patrons to enjoy the experience. To finish this off; I am writing this review not because of the conditions; but because of the unacceptable courtesy of the two individuals in the proshop. After being unceremoniously assaulted by the surprise sprinkler attack; I went into the proshop commenting ""Hey; we were playing on the course and the sprinklers; not only prevented us from playing the round; they sprayed us"" (with what I assume to be reclaimed water; no fun). The more senior individual looked at me with an attitude and simply said ""Well that's over seeding; their going all day; we tried to warn you"" (while holding up the; carts on path only - reseeding sign). The whole experience was low; but these guys topped it off. I have zero interest in going back to this middle of nowhere course.",3
70,"[REVIEW_1] Haven't had a chance to try much of what St. Louis has to offer in Mexican since I'm fairly new here. Tried this place and won't be going anywhere else for my Mexican fix. Authentic flavors and textures makes it even better; makes me think my brother-in-law's mother is in the kitchen. Great food; good prices; excellent portion size. [REVIEW_2] each & every time i go home to visit my family in STL; i make it a point to get my happy ass to a ted drewes. do the same; and you won't be disappointed. custard is so much better than ice cream; and i swear that ted drewes' custard must have opiates in it. so insanely delicious. go. now. [REVIEW_3] The food has no flavor whatsoever. Their ""queso"" is nacho cheese sauce. I would go to Taco Bell before I would go back here. [REVIEW_4] Good stay; comfortable beds; modern decor; everything I was looking for.  It's across the street from a few fast food joints and has a big park lots. [REVIEW_5] Overpriced and pretentious...this outfit charges 2x the normal price for everything.  Didn't try all of the 17 restaurants; but what I did have was just average.   Rooms weren't even as nice as the much lower priced Hampton Inn.    Cannot express how disappointed I was.  Seemed like if you just looked at something they charged you for it.    The interior gardens were nice but really not worth it. This is Disney World for adults [REVIEW_6] Excellent healthy options for NOLA dining with lots of to go choices. I had turkey meatballs and spaghetti. It is a wonderful lunch place. [REVIEW_7] I was recently in an accident where someone hit the passenger side of my car; and with my car being a lease I was paranoid and super frustrated. However; Ken; Service Manager; helped alleviate my worries. From when I first called first thing in the morning following the accident up until I picked up my car from being repaired a week later I had nothing but pleasant exchanges with him. Ken walked me through each and every step and made me feel comfortable with the work that was going to be done; as well as provided the lowest quote as compared to the other body shops I checked out.  I would definitely recommend Ken and his team not only because they completed the work in a timely fashion; but also because their communication and follow through was super helpful in a very stressful situation. [REVIEW_8] A few weeks ago; I over heard one of the management tell an employee in front of customers that he doesn't like white people. Walked out before even being seated. Not going to give them my money if that is their attitude. Obviously I am unwelcome. [REVIEW_9] DON'T GO HERE FOR UBER. I have had the WORST buying experience of my life here. I walked into this dealership for the first time around the end of June. The sales people seemed helpful and answered my questions at first. I even came back a couple times before I made a decision on the car. On saturday July 2nd I made the deposit and was promised a car the following friday (July 8) latest. I patiently waited checking back a couple times throughout the week to get updates on the situation to make sure everything went smoothly. Not only was it extremely time consuming because they just didn't wanna help you out until your presence became an annoyance to them; they also kept lying to get me to leave; giving me deadlines they never met. They constantly told me that they would call me back and let me know but they never did. Today 12 days have past; and they still did not give me a proper response regarding the fate of the promised car. Today someone actually picked up the phone and after giving me a very unclear response about the fate of the car shut down the phone without letting me respond. Very rude. Who is going to reimburse me 9 days (taking out 3 days that they initially promised to deliver) of not being able to work? On average I lost more than a $1000 already by not being able to work and I still don't know what will happen. Forget about the money; the negative attitude and treatment you will receive here is not worth any money in the world. [REVIEW_10] You can only give a place so many chances. Time after time; they screw up your order and offer no apology. I not even asking for a free pizza; all I want is an apology; and I can't even get that. This is why corporate restaurants are dying; because the people who work there don't care.",5
71,"[REVIEW_1] This sushi restaurant was horrible.  First; when we walked in we were POINTED to our table; not actually walked to it.  No one smiled at us; and we were completely ignored throughout our stay.  We had 3 different people serving us; so we had no idea who our waitress was.  No one explained to us that the only option at ZEN was all you can eat; so when we ordered only 4 small items and received a bill for $56.00; we were astonished.  The waitresses simply ""dumped"" the food to our table....No smiles; no asking who the food was for.  I had to get up from our table to ask for our bill; as we were completely ignored and sat there forever waiting for someone to serve us.  I ended up complaining to one of the waitresses who laughed throughout the few minutes I complained.  DO NOT go to this restaurant....Overall a HORRIBLE experience!!! [REVIEW_2] No stars. Like many people I purchased through Priceline. Got to counter and the girl said you want four wheel drive right? I had prepaid $26 a day. She said it's $27 a day for that. So I'm thinking $1 a day upgrade ? Ya. That's fine. I get a Hyundai. Then I see another withdrawal from my bank account more than doubling my charges for the rental. When I returned the car and bring up the issue the guys said it was a daily upgrade. So I argue with the manager and he says I can't do anything there is a signed contract. I said what's your name? He said dan. What's your last name? You don't need it and slammed the window in my face! Great customer service. I will never use Avis again and I will make sure no one I know does either. [REVIEW_3] So disappointing. Stopped by for the first time Friday night.  There were 3 people at the bar. The rest of the place was empty.  Sat down; no acknowledgement from the staff.  Went up to the bar and took a menu; still no acknowledgement from the staff.  The guy behind the bar walked right past us to get a bottle of wine for the people at the bar; still no acknowledgement.  Finally after 15 minutes of being invisible; we walked out; and still no acknowledgement. We are new to the neighborhood and are wine drinkers.  We really wanted this to be our new hangout. However; we will look for a place that wants to provide service; where we are happy to spend our money. [REVIEW_4] MmmmmmMmmm. You can find a philly cheesesteak at almost every corner in the city but it's nearly impossible to find a place that sells really good italian sausage sandwiches and italian roast beef.  George's Sandwich Shop is located right in the Italian Market area. Order an italian sausage sandwich and you have a choice of sweet; hot; or *burn my ass* peppers..  The sandwiches here are enormous and very satisfying.  They also have tripe sandwiches; hot dogs; crab cake sandwiches. Funny quote discovered here: ""Don't divorce your wife if she can't cook...eat here and keep her as a pet."" :) [REVIEW_5] Wednesday night 8/24/16. Talk about bad.. Wow... All I can say. This place has taken a massive backward step since my wife and I use to frequent the location often while she was in hospo at Ruths down the road...The girl at the bar was a completely unprofessional.. Essentially asked us to leave and gave no reason. When we asked for the bill after 1 drink she knew she was in the shit so much she crossed her name out on the receipt to avoid detection (3 times despite us asking specifically for her name and a full unaltered receipt for my records) she  kept  giving us torn off versions  without her name or the name of the place)   We visited after a cards game. I had taken my team out to celebrate wins at our organization and I was shocked at how my team was treated. No sooner had we arrived - 1pm - with [ 9 ] people ; we were given the cold shoulder... The door says open until 3 am  but it was like the girl at the bar resented us for arriving....  Dark hair girl: was so rude she basically told us she didn't want to serve us. Everyone was happy but no-one was drunk.. She was extremely rude and short with everyone. We had chosen to leave PBR to Calicoes because I like the place  ?!? Weird... The police man [ Willis ] at the bar was professional when we complained but said he could do anything;  even he seamed perplexed by the dark haired girls attitude...  Even the other bar guy was saying she should chill.  Anyway.. Wow :. What a rude and disrespectful representative  for calicoes.. I use to like this place and sooo disappointed that it's gone downhill so much .. [REVIEW_6] Service sucks big time and the manager is downright nasty; but I must say their soups and coffee are good [REVIEW_7] HORRIBLE!!! DONT waste your time or money! Been getting acrylics for 15 years and they are the WORST!!! Clueless woman and RUDE AF!  They cut me And made me wait and were rude to me after I waited and had lady start my nails ( while waiting for nail tech) who I know didn't even have a certificate to do nails. [REVIEW_8] Service was horrible; most food wasn't very good; spaghetti squash marinara was inedible. It took over an hour and the place was less than half full. As crappy as these awful chains can get. [REVIEW_9] Why don't we have a Target?  I thought K-Mart was going out of business.  Well not this one; this miserable son of a bitch refuses to die.  They had the audacity to try to update it.  It reminds me of Jack Palance its old; tired; and smells funny; but it ain't going know where.    I wish a shiny new Target would come along and stab this relic of a store through the heart with its superior retail sword.  I have experienced on no less than 5 occasions of a product being labeled as on sale only to be charged full price at the counter.  Then I have to stop the line to back to the aisle and grab the sign to show it to the cashier.  Once I bought a beach chair here; well my wife saw the dopeness of said chair and wanted to copy me.  I return to the store the next day (happened to be 80 degrees and sunny) and those SOB's raised the price of the chair $10.  I was pissed yo. [REVIEW_10] Simply put .. Awesome . Surrounded by lakes ; the apartment complex has very peaceful environment . The staff of the leasing office are very helpful and friendly. I had very nice experience staying here and would recommend the apartment to anyone who is looking for peaceful  stay in St. Petersburg;FL.",2
72,"[REVIEW_1] My husband and are new to Dtown and love Thai food.   We decided to try this place because of the reviews and we were extremely disappointed.   The food was bland and didn't resemble any Thai cuisine favors I've ever had.    For a place with Spice on the name; this was far from that. [REVIEW_2] Horrible service. When calling to place our order the person on the phone answered in the middle of cursing. When picking up our order; the workers were yelling at each other; not paying attention and our pizza was cold. I would never go to this location again. [REVIEW_3] Ralph's Market is hands down the BEST DELI around!!!!   Their HOAGIES are so delicious that when I moved away; I now have Ralph's hoagies flown down to me in Miami. There is nothing else comparable in South Jersey or Miami for that matter.   Ralph's hoagies are made with delectable rolls; fresh cut deli meats and cheeses and can be custom made to your liking.   The service is top notch and always friendly.   If you haven't tried one yet; you won't regret it and you'll be back for more. [REVIEW_4] We visited one morning for brunch and were very impressed! We started with fried green tomatoes and they were amazing!! Seriously the best fried green tomatoes we have ever had. The catfish and grits were also very good. Excited to return for dinner and listen to some jazz music! [REVIEW_5] Should've taken people's advice here; horrible horrible customer service; purchased a vehicle here 5 weeks ago still waiting for my registration; as of now nobody seems to take responsibility for their actions have been getting the run around. My temporary tag has expired and they refuse to give me another one. To safe yourself from aggrevation and headache find a different dealer. Placed a picture of expired tags. Will update on outcome. [REVIEW_6] Smoking allowed. There; I said it.  Good equipment; lots of room for players; and a nice area for spectators.  But they allow smoking.  EDIT: Lowering to 1 star after ""Peter F."" posted his ridiculous claim that spending $22;000 on an air filter makes any difference in protecting his customers from deadly carcinogens...he should do his homework: https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/air-purifier-smoke/faq-20058555 [REVIEW_7] A restaurant worth visiting! This place offers exceptional service and a delicious menu! The staff are class acts and the venue is beautiful. Well done and thank you for making my dining experience such a great one! [REVIEW_8] My boyfriend and I were looking for some good Mexican food for his birthday; and since I missed the boat on getting a reservation at El Vez I figured we would give this a try. The reviews seemed okay and everyone said that the drinks were really good.   Not at all true....  To start with; we ordered the guacamole. I have had a lot of different kinds and make it myself at home; and this was incredibly bland with not a lot of flavor.  I ordered the Carnitas Tacos and my boyfriend got the Brisket Tacos (special of the day). They were all right; but the waiter told us right off the bat he would recommend a side since they were small portions.  We didn't end up eating any of our side since they were so big; we each only finished two tacos!   The most disappointing part of this whole experience was the drinks.  I got the Classic Mojito (which I have also had and made many times before) and he got the Mexican style Mojito; that apparently is with cilantro and tequilla instead of rum and mint.  The first batch were really delicious; so we ordered another round. Not at ALL the same drink.  They looked very different; but mainly they didn't taste at all similar.  Very very sweet and acidic; way too bitter.  We politely called the waiter over and asked if the bartender wouldn't mind remaking them since the first drinks we had were very different; and he obliged. A few seconds later the bartender came back and told us she remade the drinks but tasted them and they tasted exactly how they should be.  She was very condescending and rude (My boyfriend and I have both worked in customer service before...when customers are being polite in their complaints; there is no need to be rude back) and said she would make the drink for us 10 times if we wanted but it wouldn't be any different. She said that they first AMAZING drink we had must have been made wrong.  She kept asking us how they were different and we had trouble explaining to her exactly what to change; so we decided to let it go and asked for the check. Yes; we still got charged for the shitty drinks that we left on our table.   For a tequilla bar who is apparently known for their drinks; the inconsistency is frightening.  I was very disappointed in the entire experience; not what I was planning for the first birthday that my boyfriend and I spent together. [REVIEW_9] I'm not sure why I'm seeing such low reviews but this place is AMAZING. We sat at the outside bar area; the service was excellent and the food came out super fast. Their guacamole is sooooo good and it's so fresh. Everything we ordered was fresh and wonderful. I will def be back. We had the ahi tuna taco and the mahi taco. Portions are pretty big too; prices are awesome. [REVIEW_10] I had the worst duck that I have ever had.  It was so tough that I could hardly cut into it.  The cherry sauce was uninspiring at best.  My wife had a curried sole; in which the turmeric was overwhelming.  The only creditable thing was that they agreed to take the duck off my bill.",4
73,"[REVIEW_1] If I could give zero stars I would. This is the worst store in this area. I bought a tree stand and was told I could return the product within 30 days if the stand did not fit our tree. Shortly after Christmas I came by to return a $9 tree stand as it did not fit. I was then told by their manager; Rosa; that their policy has always been all Christmas items are final sale. They wouldn't even consider store credit but just flat out refused to do anything. So; do not trust the person at the checkout counter and definitely avoid any Christmas items as you will not be allowed to return anything. Everything is final sale it seems. So; Kmart Goleta; consider me a permanent loss of a customer. I'd rather go to amazon. At least they understand customer service. [REVIEW_2] This is one of our favorite spots in Nashville.  It has recently been remodeled and looks great!  The patio can get loud; but other than that no complaints. [REVIEW_3] My partner and I went there for brunch today. Average food; terrible service. Restrooms are so dirty.  Skip it if you may; so many other much better alternatives in town for brunch. [REVIEW_4] MY favorite place to eat in Nashville. The food is pricey; but delicious. Many a date or business dinner spot; not some much for bringing your friends to; unless they like this type of vibe. [REVIEW_5] Taylor Home Solutions cleaned all the ducts in our rather large home; and then cleaned all the carpets; all in only four hours!  Of the eight quotes I received for carpet cleaning; Taylor Home Solutions was easily half the price of all other quotes in town! They were able to quickly schedule the cleaning and arrived on time; something that most companies do not do.  The carpets look brand new and the house smells clean! [REVIEW_6] This place is so lovely. It has everything!! Amazing wine selection; hookah's; Lebanese food which I think is the best in the city. [REVIEW_7] I really; really; really like Fred Meyer. Especially this one on Federal Way. 9.9 out 10 times a great experience. Love the ads; love the e-coupons; love the produce; love the meat department; love the cheese department; love the wine; affordable clothing; gifts; seasonal garden area; toys; playland; pharmacy; and the big sales... I really LOVE that just about every single time I've been here (and it's been A LOT) the customer service is excellent. I feel happy to be spending my money here. That means a lot.  The pricing is very good if you watch the ads and use their coupons. I love the fuel discount too. The employees are usually in a pretty good mood - and you can feel it. Today my checker was Aaron - and he is AWESOME!  Thank you for making it such a pleasant experience in this store. A thousand times - THANK YOU! :)  Oh - thanks also for supporting the arts in our community! [REVIEW_8] Let me start out by saying that I am a nut for good sushi. Out of probably 200 sushi bars I have been to; there are only 9 places in the world that I have been to that meet my criteria to be called a ""good"" sushi bar. Three are in Japan; 2 are in Los Angeles; 1 is in San Francisco; 2 are in New York; and then there's this place in sh*tty old Philadelphia; a 5 minute cab ride from my apartment in Center city. Izumi is nothing short of excellent in every way. Any good food starts out with good ingredients. Making good traditional sushi is very simple: use good quality rice; prepared properly; excellent fish; and a dab of some good home-made ""wasabi"". Most places suck at all or some of these things. Not this place. Small restaurant with maybe 4 staffers including one in the front-of-house. Hardest working people in the restaurant industry; those FOH guys. Probably only 30-35 seats; but when the place is full; they are running around like crazy; serving food; taking orders; busing tables; and seating new parties. The wait can be long; but it is worth it. All of the fish I have had there (virtually every fish on the menu) has been perfect as sashimi and sushi; and their maki rolls are good as well. Special shout-outs for the tuna; salmon; super-white tuna (don't eat too much because of high wax content and digestive issues); and the oh toro. All are excellent in texture; quality; taste; and preparation. If you like spicy tuna rolls; you won't eat them again at your local neighborhood sushi joint. Each order is prepared individually from a filet of tuna scraped with a spoon. There's no giant tub of tuna scraps in the back mixed with mayo and a little sririacha served all day.   The good food doesn't stop at the sushi; though. Their slow roasted beef shortrib is nothing short of ""oh-my-goodness this is amazing"".  We first visited Izumi by accident about 2 or 3 months ago; and now find ourselves there once a week. It's that good. [REVIEW_9] I cannot say enough about the accommodations at the JW. I was working a trade show in the Grand Ballroom today and needed to pump as I am a new mom. Nathan was so quick to help as I was searching for a location that I could use. He opened up a boardroom for me to use and locked it behind me so I would not be disturbed. I know there was at least one other mom that was accommodated at the same time I was. All of the facilities; as well as the boardroom; were impeccably clean. I am so grateful for how kind and wonderful the staff was. Big kudos to the JW and the staff for making such awesome arrangements to support working moms- totally made my day! [REVIEW_10] There is a banner on the website that says ""free shipping over $50"". This company hates honoring this promotion and it's always a a hassle to get the free shipping and they conveniently have the shopping cart set up to always charge the shipping fee even if your order total qualifies for the free shipping. Anyway; my order total came to $160 but I was still charged shipping at checkout. So I called cust svc and spoke to an idiot beyotch that was hostile and completely mathematically challenged and illogical; as her defense was that since I used a coupon on my order; I should be okay with paying the shipping fee. Huh?! When that excuse didn't work; she then said I wasn't charged shipping for the conditioner (I had 4  items on my order). Umm; that makes no sense; as I'm still paying shipping on the other items (that are packaged in the same box as the ""freely shipped"" conditioner); plus the  shipping fee is a flate rate; so what good is it if one item out of 4 is shipped free?!  I have spent hundreds of dollars w/ this company but will never ever shop here again. My advice to all consumers is to bankrupt companies that don't appreciate your business.",7
74,"[REVIEW_1] Did not like this hotel at all. Me and my husband stayed there one night after getting off our honeymoon cruise out of New Orleans. While still on the boat I called the hotel to let them know that we would only be staying one of the two nights we reserved due to some issues with our home in Houston. We had to leave early to address them in person. I communicated that with the manager who stated that he would call me back because he was dealing with another customer. Never received a callback. We checked in Saturday March 5 at 1600. We left the next day Sunday March 6 at 1130. As we checked out I told the manager it was an early checkout and he said that I would have to talk to the third party vendor (booking.com) to not be charged. I was okay with that.  Fast forward to today. Called booking.com and the customer associate stated that the manager charged me for the second night that I never used as a penalty for not warning them of our ealy check out. He lied. I spoke to him at least twice about us leaving. DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU ARE OUT OF TOWN. VERY UNCLEAN AND DISGUSTING and the management is sketchy. Take your money and go somewhere nicer. [REVIEW_2] Well worth the trip up to Reno from the Bay Area for a Mom's only weekend at the spa.  So relaxing and entertaining.  We rarely left the casino and spa.  It's been remodeled since the last time I was there; so everything was fresh and new.  Wish I could say the same for the rest of the strip.  Although this was a moms only weekend the hotel had a lot more features for kids.  Huge arcade room and a fantastic looking pool. [REVIEW_3] Three chances and they are out! We tried to like this place as the location is easy and convenient. The bar is great; the staff friendly; but there is not a dish I have tried that is passable (although the asian shrimp wasn't bad; but very sweet). First visit we wrote off as a new restaurant working out the bugs. On our second visit I ordered a turkey burger and received a dry turkey patty. No one informed me that they were out of buns; but they could have at least tried to dress it up. It was seriously a lone piece of ground meat (to their credit; the manager did comp that meal). Today we received fish and chips that had to come out of a box and chicken salad that could have greased my axles!  We won't be back. [REVIEW_4] Stupendous customer service; and exquisite food. My favorite is the Japanese pan noodles with marinated steak. [REVIEW_5] A coworker took me to lunch here; this was my first time visiting a Firehouse Subs restaurant. The restaurant was clean; and the servers were very friendly and attentive. My sandwich (meatball) was served promptly and was very fresh and hot. The wheat bread was awesome. They have one of the new pop machines that lets you pick from several dozen flavors. The variety of subs leans to the healthy side. They have only white and wheat bread. There is a slight bit of uniqueness to their subs; but mostly they are pretty standard (more like Subway than like Which Wich). I think the price for a medium sub and drink is a bit high: $9. A great place to eat for a change up on sandwiches. [REVIEW_6] This review incident dates back to 2009 but I still truly feel ""hot under the collar"" about my used car experience with Sherwood Kia.  I bought a 2002 Sunfire; cash; off the lot. The salesman was pushy; rude; and very ignorant. Upon the test drive the car was was hesitating as I was shifting gears and he said that they would look at the problem before I left the lot if I bought the car. I paid $3000 for it and needless to say....what a piece of *%#@! Everything that was checked off their ""maintenance report"" saying was in good condition had to be replaced within the first week I had the car as I took it to a reputable mechanic.  SO....7 days; I asked for my money back!!! I got the run around so bad that I eventually wrote a letter to the owner (AFTER NO ONE WAS RETURNING MY CALLS) and the Used Car dept. manager (whoever) called me after another 2 weeks and asked me to come in. I went in there asked for the manager and then I stood in the dealership for 30-minutes before he came up to me. Well....we got into a yelling match in the parking lot after I was in tears and yelling inside and threatened to call the BBB; tell everyone of FB; and whoever else would listen that...get this...(his exact words)...""We DO NOT guarantee quality used vehicles""!!!! I'm not kidding! I never got my money back and I REFUSE to ever do business there again!!!! [REVIEW_7] I am not sure they deserve one star..but they do not deserve two. Went this afternoon shortly after lunchtime. Walked in and was seated with my girl near the buffet. We discussed eating from it...but decided against it. I haven't been to a CM since the one left the Foothills mall many years ago....I never had any issue with anything at that location. The one on Campbell was not good. Server was polite; but when she came and gave us silverware...it was as if she was playing tiddlywinks...I was a bit perplexed when my three pieces were laid down knife....spoon over knife at a 45 degree angle; then the fork over top the same way...about 6 inches from my napkin. I hadn't thought about it until now...but I feel she was trying in code to tell me not to eat there. Yeah....that has to be it. I looked at the fork...and it looked as if it was taken from the table behind us....as they were using it....it was replaced with a clean one....I am hoping it was anyways...at least there was nothing on it that I could see...and that is 90% of the battle. On to the food. I ordered a chorizo burro. $9.00. This was the driest chorizo I have ever eaten....as my girth with attest.....I have had much chorizo in my life. About three hours after.....I feel yucky. Anyways.....I will not be returning here. [REVIEW_8] Not my first time there tonight but absolutely my last.  I am beyond sick to my stomach (literally) as I type this and so are my 3 friends that went there with me tonight. Eat here at your own risk; we had a friend in from out of state and it ruined our night. [REVIEW_9] Bus over an hour late before I gave up. Call centers not open to get information until after 6 am even though they have busses running at 4:35 am. Would not give refund and use terms and conditions item 14 as a blanket clause to not give refund [REVIEW_10] This place is a dirty mess. I have eaten here and have been disappointed at how dirty it was multiple times.   Furthermore; the wait staff is obnoxious and had bad attitudes. Not only to i is; but other diners. Last night they let a woman with her DOGS and these dogs were all over the place. They smelled and was it awful for us and others.   The food was not quality and the manager tried to make amends and knew this was a terrible experience. Avoid at all costs.",3
75,"[REVIEW_1] This is the worst take out I've had.  All I wanted was a large salad tonight and I'm so mad I just wasted $20.  I tied ordering a taco salad and when I asked the girl for an add on of chicken; she said no. Not it will be an extra 2 or 3 dollars (which I would have happily paid) but just a no we won't do it.  I changed my order to the Udon Noodle Salad.  I was then told it would be 45 min-1 hour.  It was an hour and a half+ before I got my order.   I was looking forward to a large arugula salad with chicken and the other items; instead I got a small bowl of cold noodles with a little arugula and cold chicken. It was awful and a waste of money.  I ordered sweet potato fries on the side and they would have been decent had they not been freezing cold.  Don't waste your money! [REVIEW_2] My Room was disgusting. The odor when I walked in was terrible. They had put a very large air filter in the living room to try and mask the smell. The carpet looks as if it was molding in the bedroom against the wall - looks to be the shower wall. Must have leaked.  No iron had to call in am and wait. Oh btw when I called to have someone come up and check the room and the smell they never came - nice!  You know Mgmt knows about the issues and are avoiding them. I'm a Hilton and Marriott frequent guest for business. Man this makes me not want to give Hilton my business. Starwood is now going to move up a notch as  top two property to stay at.   Oh the power went out in the hotel at 6 am ish. Not their fault as the waffle house next door had it power off too. It was freaky though to wake up in pitch black. Thank god for iPhone flashlight app!!! [REVIEW_3] After a 90-min wait (we were told it would be an hour); I went for dinner with my sisters. The food was just okay and over-priced. The polenta wasn't the best I've had; the cheese empanadas were not empanadas but rather fried little puff balls (and if they're going to be vegetarian; there should more more; not less of the meat ones); the cauliflower was pretty good but again; not worth the price.   But let me tell you about our service! First the server brought out the wrong wine for my sisters (they got a red cab Mendoza; a white Chardonnay was delivered). Nobody really checked on us except to ask if we wanted to order more food. Then! One of my sisters PULLED A REALLY LONG HAIR OUT OF HER MOUTH AFTER TAKING A BITE OF FOOD!!!!!!!! When we alerted our server; his response was; ""ew; I'll be sure to tell the chef.""  NEVER did we get an apology; nor was the item replaced nor taken off the check!!!!! And on top of that; he charged us for the red AND the white wine!!!!! The sister who had the hair is super polite and it was impressive that she even alerted him of the hair; so unfortunately she did not fight to have the item taken off; regardless of my urging her to do so. Alas; I decided to share this review. That hair was LONG AND NASTY!   No way will I return. What a shame. [REVIEW_4] I dig Chinatown in Philly. It has always been a uniquely cool place for myself since my college days. Chinatown is an overload for the senses; from the smells; the tastes; the scenery and the hustle and bustle.  Chinatown Philly is a must stop when visiting Philadelphia. The location is very close to Old City and the historic areas.  The choices of different Pan Asian cuisines in a concentrated area are outstanding and varied. Chinatown is also evolving; there are new younger and hipper places juxtaposed with the old and classic Chinatown establishments.  My personal favorites are Dim Sum Garden; Nan Zhou Hand Drawn Noodle House; Rangoon and Terwakawa Ramen. There is also a new food court on Race Street called Chinatown Square. I have not tried this yet; but it looks very nice with a decent array of food options. For desserts there are several bubble tea and rolled ice cream shops plus A La Mouse; a Japanese-French style café. There are even several hair salons that have late hours and reasonable prices.  Anything is possible is Chinatown; at least food wise. [REVIEW_5] I've had the crispy chick burger and fries with aioli dip several times and it's so good I'm not gonna change my order. If they could improve in something it would only be lowering prices. [REVIEW_6] What is wrong with this O Charley's?  Where  to begin.  The positive; our waitress Kaitlyn was outstanding.  That's it for the positive.  It is a Sunday...Fathers Day and only place in town with no brunch wait.  Our first signal.  They didn't have enough menus when we were seated.  It took 25 minutes for one of drinks to arrive.  My wife's coffee was cold and full of grounds.  Food arrived.  My omelet was cooked to death; never got my toast or fruit.  Everyone else got waffles.  They were chewy like they had been re heated.  Only two small things of syrup.  No butter or sugar on my wife's. Her eggs were scrambled rather than over hard.  Just one thing after another.  Never be back for brunch. [REVIEW_7] Whatever you do avoid the asian lady (sorry i do not know her nationality) with grey salt n pepper hair AT ALL COSTS. Her work is substandard (ie i had to file my own nails to correct her shape; clean under my nails; adjust the stones on my nails). You show a design; she says okay then starts and tells you she doesnt have the materials. There was a void in my nail and she kept telling me it wasnt there and then proceeded to ""buff"" it out. I had to tell her twice to fix it. I paid im full; but will definitely watch my credit card statement for extra charges. My friend's nails came out great (she had one of the male nail techs). I can fix mine at home; I'll NEVER go back. Beware!!! [REVIEW_8] My husband and I ate lunch here a month ago and the experience wasn't the best. We had to wait at least 20 minutes to get our drinks and we heard our waitress complain she was overworked right in front of us... I doubt we will be back. [REVIEW_9] IF YOU ARE FEMALE & YOUNG; GO SOMEWHERE ELSE  I dropped off my car and told them I needed my oil change. They were very friendly and said they would have it done quickly; which was appreciated. When I came back to pick up my car three hours later; they charged me $75 dollars for the oil change. The guy working the counter could tell I was shocked (an oil change at the dealer usually costs $35).  He explained they had used synthetic oil. When I asked why they would give me synthetic oil when I didn't ask for it; he gave me some BS answer that it was standard for Toyotas. Since he could tell I was upset; he said they were running a special and knocked down the price by 25%.   I am aware that I am a young woman and that I don't know much about cars but I do not appreciate being taken advantage of. I will be going elsewhere for car maintenance from now on.  Wish I had read the reviews before trying out this Firestone. It looks like other women have had the same experience in the past. [REVIEW_10] Me and my friend paid to get our open water certification. Dennis Koslin was the instructor and was the most disrespectful ""teacher"" I have ever worked with in my life. I put quotes around the word teacher due to the fact that this was not a learning environment. If you asked any question during the class he would not answer it and would attempt to make a joke out of you as a person (unrelated to the question you asked). If you're looking for a fun learning experience where you feel fine to ask questions; this is not the place for you. If you are looking to be respected on a basic human level; this is not the place for you. If you want to be treated like an animal and for him to speak down to you; this is the place for you.  His father (the guy who runs the actual shop) was very kind and informative.",2
76,"[REVIEW_1] Such a great place to skate at; hanging-out with Family and friends. The staff here at Coachlite are super friendly. [REVIEW_2] Ordered from grubhub waited an hour and a half for delivery so I called naturally no one picked up for another 20 minutes then when the guy answers his explanation was that they were on break and hadn't made my order yet and gave me the "" oh well"" attitude and didn't offer any kind of compensation. [REVIEW_3] First; I want to clarify that the service was great! Unfortunately the food sucked so hard that they only came out with the rare one-star rating.  I was really; really disappointed in the quality of food! It was basically inedible...the best thing was my daughter's French toast (which was still just average). My meal was hash browns covered in peppers & onions; salsa and cheese. The peppers & onions weren't fully cooked; the hash browns were like mush and it was smothered in plain old pace salsa from a jar. Sick. And so; so disappointing. Also incredibly over priced at $10 for a breakfast meal. We had 2 adult and 1 child meals; and used a free meal coupon and the bill still managed to be over $20?! When we go to Cracker Barrel around the corner the tab is $22 (no coupons or discounts) and we get way more food of much higher quality. Breakfasts will be at Cracker Barrel from now on! [REVIEW_4] Everything was delicious and fresh. The lunch specials are a great deal. I was told to order ahead of time but we didn't need to. [REVIEW_5] After looking at other reviews on Yelp; I had to come here! I also noticed seating seemed limited; but we decided to go at an off hour (even then it was still busy; but we managed to snag a table).   I will say every review that cites this place as being slow in service is spot on - it is slow. I don't think the kitchen is well organized to be honest; and they don't encourage take out orders; which is why they are always so full.   We ordered two lunch combos; one with a Figo pizza; and a caprese salad; the other with a Margherita pizza and a caesar salad. For the beverage we both got the unsweetened iced tea (I wish they had better beverage options!).   The pizzas were both amazing and perfectly balanced; on par with Pizzeria Bianco (though I say Pizzeria Bianco is just a little better). The salads were delicious; but my husband was a little off put by the piece of anchovy on top (on the caesar). Then there was this crusty bread that was complimentary with olive oil (to die for).   At the end of the meal we were given a tiny spoonful of the gelato; I was given sweet cream; my husband hazelnut. We thought the gelato was delicious; but quite frankly we were completely out of room. I think they should lead the visit with a gelato sample (or do a special with dessert OR salad)! Maybe next time!   Overall; I would say the food was excellent; service was ok; but slow and the prices were reasonable! They do need a larger dining room with more staff and a better layout! Time to expand! [REVIEW_6] Bella Linea is the place to go for the most beautiful linens in town. They will work with you and offer free design help in-store and have designers on staff to come to your home as well.  The Bella Linea staff are so helpful and will work with you on any special sizes you need.  And when you give a gift from Bella Linea it always seems special. [REVIEW_7] Just moved into the area and wanted to take my Caribbean parents who were visiting out to lunch. Seeing the Trinidadian flag hanging out the door; I knew I had to take my mother there! The ambience was calm and relaxing and our server Jay was very kind. We started with the fried shrimp wantons which were great; and our three dishes: curry goat; curry shrimp and curry chicken roti were all flavorful. The roti was so soft! A mild taste for all backgrounds; but they were happy to bring out a side of pepper sauce for my dad who needed a kick. The owner Anthony was kind enough to greet us and explain the meaning behind the name of the restaurant. The peanut punch is a must have. The food was authentic and satisfied my Trinidadian mother! Will be frequent customers!! [REVIEW_8] My wife and I had to leave Zydeco after being seated at our table.  We waited for several minutes for the wait staff to acknowledge us; but as we sat at our table they just walked all around us without anyone even speaking to us. A couple seated after us was waited on quickly and received their drinks before we decided to leave. [REVIEW_9] This place was awful. I went because it was the only place open late at night. Burger and fries were horrible and I got an apple pie which tasted like it came out of a refrigerated box. [REVIEW_10] We hired Minuteman to re-key our new home as well as add deadbolts as needed.  They were prompt; courteous; and friendly.  We will definitely use Minuteman in the future. (Meridian; ID)",6
77,"[REVIEW_1] Literally one of the best meals I have had in the quarter!  Shrimp n grits is one of my favorite things to eat in the South...their version cannot be topped.  Can't wait to come back here. [REVIEW_2] I compare this hotel to a pig wearing lipstick.  It is still a pig.  Nice beds; yup; updated bathrooms; yes; new carpet in room; yes. Nice staff; yes. So why 1 star?  It is a dump and whoever decided to put all this new stuff into rooms that smell like mold and mildew should be fired. I am staying here for a convention so someone else booked the rooms as I usually look at reviews before making a reservation. Heading that it was a Marriott and that is was an Opryland hotel; I thought; oh it will be nice. After walking into the room and getting the nasty smell hit me; I turned to the Marriott app to look st the reviews as well as on yelp.  Many other complaints posted. I asked my co-workers and 3 of the 4 people that I am traveling with also have the same smell.   Note to the management team: shame on you for booking these rooms without fixing the problem. [REVIEW_3] Justin's a really nice guy.  He's easy to talk to in order to get the haircut you want.  You can park on the side street; so the location is good.  What's not to like? [REVIEW_4] I love this place. It's the closest thing to a Vegas casino I've seen. Slots; table games and a poker room. The restaurants are all amazing and they have a good variety. Mexican; American; steakhouse and more. They have two Starbucks. Free entertainment some nights. Their concert venue is great; but the thing that stands out the most is the hotel. Beautiful rooms. The pool area is amazing; relaxing and fun. This is hands down the best thing in Tucson. There is something for everyone of all ages. In the summer my kids like staying there and enjoying the pool and restaurants. Sign up for a players club card. They send you great deals on rooms; free concert tickets and free play. The buffet is great; especially the Sunday brunch which includes champagne. Great job casino del sol. [REVIEW_5] I really wanted to like this place because of the cool ambiance.  I ordered the Philly cheese steak.  Aside from the mediocre taste; small portion size; and unreasonably high price of my entree;  the fact that it gave me food poisoning really nailed it home.  On the plus side; nobody else at my table endured food poisoning from their entrees (omelets and juevos rancheros) and the wait staff was pleasant. [REVIEW_6] Cool spot in a great location. We got there early; so didn't have the same crushing crowds others have talked about. The bartenders are awesome. Made me a Perfect Rye Manhattan on the rocks; never had one before...I'm hooked. Easily the best burger I've ever had! Will absolutely be back [REVIEW_7] I usually stay at The Grand Sierra.  It is where I taught my son to swim years ago; so I have been biased to that property.  However; with it under construction recently; and after they took the horse statues out of the Valet area; and began major construction; I decided to try the Peppermill by a friends suggestion.  The Operations Manager; David Fuller went above and beyond to make my stay unbelievably excellent.  We were met at the hotel and ""double"" upgraded to a Tuscany Balcony Suite at check-in.  Needless to say; it had a balcony.  Very cool!  The room upgrade started my trip off on a perfect note.  Thank you Peppermill!  I will be back.  My experience was better than expected thanks in part to the staff going the extra mile for us. [REVIEW_8] Josef's did our wedding cake; it was absolutely incredible!!!! Both the cake and the design.  The custom airbrushed fondant leaves and branches to match our invitations were amazing!  The fondant was perfectly thin on the outside of the cake.  It was delivered precisely on time and was just amazing!!! Couldn't have been happier!  I also have to say we love their breakfasts!!! Super delicious! [REVIEW_9] We had the tomato and mozzarella salad and ordered a grandma red pizza with red onion and mushrooms.  Both were delicious. Very very good pizza.  The service was good and the place itself is really fun.  Definitely check it out- cash only and BYOB. [REVIEW_10] Great choice in a small shop. Worth the drive. The wine cakes are excellent! Just went here for first time based on yelp reviews and will definitely be going back",8
78,"[REVIEW_1] this place should really get a -1 star for inconsistent service. I've been here for a couple occasions but this time was the absolute worst. So bad I had to create a Yelp account to write a review. That's how piss I was leaving the restaurant.   Long story short; we ordered the enormous nachos which they now down sized to a smaller portion than what it use to be. Not to mention guacamole use to be included but now it's an additional dollar. We also ordered 20 piece wings but when it came out; there was only 19 pieces. (Not that we intentionally counted but there was 5 of us And we agreed everyone was going to get 4 each; equaling 20) We brought it to our servers attention who disappeared for long periods of a time. It seemed like we always had to look around to try to find him and flag him down. It was very annoying; the server to the table next to us was more attentive to his table than ours was to ours. 15 mins gone by after we told him; still nothing. Finally he came back and by this time we just wanted our check. When we recieved our check we were still charged full price for the wings. Whatever; it's just 1 wing but the more we thought about it the more we got upset because it seemed as tho they didn't care about customer service much. We seemed like a joke to them complaining about a missing wing. My bf flagged down the manager and when we brought it to his attention; he basically blew us off and said ""I'll take off a dollar for you."" Now that was insulting. Then out of nowhere our server came over with a plate with just 1 wing on it since he seen us looking for the manager. We don't give a daym about the wing. This is poor customer service. If we would have went anywhere else; they would have apologized for the mistake which we all would have understood; it happens. Then asked us if we needed anything and immediately replaced what was missing and on top of that added some more. Now that's customer service. For what they did; we will not becoming back ever again. It was a daym joke.   So you have been warned; do not go here and expect good service because they really don't give a daym about you. It was a rip off. [REVIEW_2] I will not return to this location. I contacted the manager in regards to a poorly made pizza I received; he replied to my online inquiry but never followed through on taking care of things. I even sent a photo to prove that the appearance of the pizza was not acceptable; and I never heard back from him. [REVIEW_3] So basically; you are going to be having a student cut your hair...  There is a ""teacher"" watching; but I don't think they are any better since the ""teacher"" messed up my cut more than the student did.  The haircuts are cheap; so if you are looking for something really affordable and want to take your chances; then go for it.  It will really all depend on how good of a student you have and how ready they are at that time to be a real stylist/barber.  My cut just so happened to turn out horribly; but I prepared myself for that since I knew what I was getting myself into.  Just prepare yourself for the same if you decide to take a chance to get a cut here.  DO NOT do it if you definitely need to get a good cut for an event or something because it can potentially turn out to be tragic! [REVIEW_4] What else can be said about this place?  I've been to St. Elmo's; and never could have imagined the place working as a more casual american restaurant.   Well; they pulled it off.  Come in for their lunch; which offers a combo of a half sandwich (prime rib; yes please!) with classic sides.  And hey; their dinner offers basically the same menu as St. Elmo's just incase that is booked for the night.  Worth the visit [REVIEW_5] When I returned to pick up my new glasses; I realized that they are horribly out of focus. Apparently they don't measure out the position of the pupils in respect to lenses in order to position the center of focus there. The staff member tried to talk me into repositioning the glasses however for me to see; they would have to be floating on my face and you can only look at he bottom most part. Umm no! Then she stated that she did measure but I don't remember such action being taken.  I asked for the lenses to be redone and they promised to send them off as urgent. Well; still no glasses. [REVIEW_6] Only came here since it was featured in US Weekly magazine as one of Taylor Swift's favorite places. This place was terrible. We ordered the pulled pork platter with a side of mac n cheese and slaw and the half ribs platter with a side of potato salad. Our order was wrong; the food was burned; the slaw had way too much vinegar; and the ribs were rock hard. I don't recommend this place at all. [REVIEW_7] The service was uninviting and made my group feel unwanted.  When we arrived it was towards the end of the brunch on Sunday.  The host was not friendly and gave the feeling of us being a burden to them. Once pointed to self seating and having a seat; the waitress brought waters but we were left without menus.  I went to the front to inquire about menus but the waitress has jumped in front of me after over hearing my wife ask me about the menus.  I apologized and told her we didn't know if we were suppose to get our own menus or if they would be brought to us.  She just stared not indicating anything.  I just walked back to our seats with her where she handed us the manus and then walked away again not saying anything.  After sitting for a few minutes my wife and I didn't know if we were suppose to order at the bar or with the waitress and at this point I was annoyed with the service and decided we should just leave.  I will never go here again! [REVIEW_8] AWFUL. I have been there more than once; and it was never great but ok. However the most recent time we went was the WORST EXPERIENCE I have ever had at a restaurant. We were sat and no one ever came to our table; I had to go get them; she got us the wrong appetizer; the food was awful and cold; everything took forever even though the restaurant was empty!!! The waitress was just terrible; I had to go find her several times. We almost got up and left and I wish we had! At the end of it our check was wrong and I never complain but when I did finally talk to the manager she didn't even care and did nothing about it. She didn't apologize or offer any kind of restitution. On our way out I did see that waitress was eating at a table; that would explain why she never came to ours! [REVIEW_9] Review for HOTEL only Stayed here on a stop over on the way to Vegas. It's right off the I-80 east but not close enough to hear any freeway noise. The room was clean; quiet and everything worked. Hot water; water pressure; A/C and heat worked. The bed was comfortable. I was on the 3rd floor and couldn't hear my neighbors through the wall at all. The only noise came from under the door; standard for most hotels I suppose; but nothing too bad. The quality of the stay in terms of the price is unbeatable. The room was $47 on a Sunday night. I'm sure it might be slightly higher for the weekend. The room is dated in terms of furniture but if that is not a big deal(which it isn't for me) then the stay is well worth the price. Included are some photos and there was some patchwork in the shower but again; I don't think that's a big deal. I will stay here again [REVIEW_10] The staff was so kind; the food was delicious; and I love the location. I highly recommend the mojito and the cassoulet!",3
79,[REVIEW_1] Had excellent chive pancake and sweet and sour Thai chicken. Fast delivery to our home. Food had phenomenal taste. Definitely Would get their food again [REVIEW_2] Clean crisp interior; food was some of the best. Service couldn't of been any better. Great Indian beer too. [REVIEW_3] Great experience!  This place has an awesome authentic atmosphere; great food; and friendly staff.  I am excited to go there when the weather is nice and they have the garage door open so you can eat in the open air right on Broad St.    We tried the Al Pastor burrito bowl and tacos.  Both had great flavor; and tasted very authentic.  Portion size on the burrito bowl was great; tacos are on the smaller side.  The owner was very friendly and seems to really care about ensuring everyone has a good experience.  My only recommendation would be that since its 3 tacos for $9; it would be cool to be able to add a 4th or maybe 5th taco for a discounted price for people who have big appetites.    Overall; I would give this place 5 stars for great tasting food; extremely friendly staff; and fun/chill environment.  It is a great addition to South Broad Street in Center City! [REVIEW_4] We're moving out of Indy in 2 days and Revolucion was a must-try before departing. It was nothing short of phenomenal! Loved the casual; order at the bar environment and simple menu. We had the chips with salsa and guacamole - awesome - and the fish; pork; shrimp; and beef tacos. Yes; they were so good; my husband ate five. Pork and shrimp were our faves but they were all so good it was hard to decide what we liked best. Give this place your business! [REVIEW_5] Okay; first review; and I don't even live in Philly anymore. But now in Houston; I'm feeling the loss.   I'd say there are two categories of doctorliness which make this a 5-star review. First; the impersonal stuff. Modern office; computerized charting; accurate scheduling (I was never kept waiting); the ability to make an appointment at short notice to get something looked at; convenient location. Can't think of anything that's lacking. She shares her office with another doctor who I haven't met.  The second category is the personal aspect. When I showed up the first time as a new patient; she spent a good deal of time with me and I got the feeling she cared about me as a person. Sweet. In all subsequent visits; that never changed. Without going into medical details; she herself called me when the results came in for some minor (and false) tests.   All in all; I can't imagine a better doctor. Why is it I found a badass doctor and a badass dentist in the one place I didn't live for any length of time? [REVIEW_6] This is a small-size Whole Foods; bigger than South street but tiny compared to Cherry Hill or Marlton; NJ. The staff however is always super nice; best of the 3 others and they are good about special orders. I love farmers markets and small local markets with great produce; but this Whole Foods offers convenience and excellent quality fresh produce. Their new location is being built north and a block closer to Fairmount so even closer for us; yay! [REVIEW_7] AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAUGE!!! I can see why they make money; this place is beautiful; but their customer service is atrocious. As someone in the event planning industry; I will see to it that I never recomend this location to any of my clients and will make sure all my partners and colleges know of the dissapointment that is Gaylord Opryland.  I was hesitant to even book this location due to the horrible reviews; but this is where she really wanted to go. Lesson learned the hard way. Never in my life have I been more disgusted with customer service; this establishment doesnt even deserve one star. As a professional event planner; I am very organized and always check my reservations. I have been planning my best friends bachelorette party since April; and booked online in advance. I called several times prior to our trip to assure it was okay that a seperate credit card holder reserved the room; and we paid with a deperate one.  I had guests arriving from all over; some drove 10+ hours and when they arrived; were not able to check in. They were refused to it being under a different name; even though I confirmed this was okay prior to arriving. They needed the confirmation number; but the one THEY SENT ME (email proof) was not working. I called the front desk while still en route to Nashville to let them know guests were waiting; and BOTH women were extremely rude and condescending. My guests had to wait an hour before getting a room.  We arrived at 4pm and had a tight schedule as we had activites starting at 5:30. We were supposed to go in; decorate for the celebration; get ready and leave. This was not the case. Upon checking in; I am told that they preauthorize the card AT CHECKIN; even though I confirmed several times over the phone that the card was just to reserve the room and we could pay at check out with our choice of payment. We had girls from all over the country coming that were bringing money towards the room; and it was to be deposited before checkout. We did not have time to go to the bank before our paid for; scheduled activities and the only offer they gave us was to preauthorize half of the amount one night until we get the rest tomorrow. At this point we are already late and not ready for our outing due to their poor communication; and it ruined our other experiences as well.  The fun doesnt stop there....we paid for a junior sweet with a sofa and a chair; two beds; and paid extra for a pull out bed. Upon FINALLY getting into our room; there is no extra bed; and not a sofa; but two chairs. This was crucial to our sleeping arrangments; and was all requeated and confirmed prior to arrival. We also requested it when they gave us a room key; and now its 12 oclock at night and we have one pull out sofa and they are still giving us a hard time about the sofa. If we could; wed pack and leave immediately but this is a once in a life time thing for my best friend; so were stuck here. Awful; awful; awful!  What a great scheme; draw in customers with a beautiful resort and then dont give a shit about them once they're here. Class act. [REVIEW_8] Have only ordered pizza but it was above and beyond every other pizza I've ordered in south Philly. Can't wait to try other menu items! [REVIEW_9] This restaurant was spot-on in so many ways - service; food; ambience. First; the service was impeccable. Our waiter was perfectly attentive; in that he always magically appeared when you needed a wine refill but in a very noninvasive way. The front of the house was outstanding. When we spotted another table getting a dish that were not on the menu and asked about it; she sent out a complementary dish for our table which was very unexpected and appreciated.   Now to the food. We started with the tomato burrata salad and the chilled sweet corn crab soup. Both were delicious; the burrata was some of the best tasting cheese I've ever had. For seconds; we had the poached egg and the wahoo. Both were standouts. The lamb ribs (not on the menu) came in between our second and third course and were sumac incrusted caramelized lamb ribs. Their texture was a cross between candied but savory braised ribs. They were falling off the bone - and were the most special dish of the night. Finally; we had the pork tenderloin and flank steak which were both stellar. The portions were perfect; and we left very full without dessert.   This restaurant has outstanding value. We have spent that much on many dinners that pale in comparison to this meal; especially with drinks; so the BYOB aspect makes it a special dinner place that you can go to more than once in a while. The ambiance is also fantastic; although it does get a little bit noisy so if you have hearing problems going earlier in the evening would be ideal. Also; note that the restaurant is very friendly to folks who are gluten-free as every dish with the exception of one on the menu was gluten-free last night.   Overall; this is now one of our top 3 favorite restaurants in Philly. We are happy to support such an outstanding restaurant that supports local; organic; sustainable ingredients. [REVIEW_10] Beautiful space; well trained staff and an elevated food experience. Everything is locally sourced and Home made; even their unique daily breads and butter! I could eat the corn custard dish every day if my life. But what I love most are their cocktails; specifically the gin w/ mint cucumber. They go down almost too easy! I have been following the owner & chef; George Sabatino; from Stateside and glad he's found a place to call home in Rittenhouse.,9
80,"[REVIEW_1] I wish I would have read the reviews before stopping here... I drove in looking to quickly get my tires filled with air because my light was on and I was having a difficult time getting them filled up due to my air valve extensions. I told them this and that I was in a hurry because I had an appointment to get to. I told them I only wanted them to fill up my tires and I didn't need them to do their regular inspection because my car is only 3 years old and had been check just a few months ago before moving here. After waiting nearly an hour I asked the man at the counter how much longer it would be and they took me in to the shop... at this point they told me the sensors in my tires either ""all broke at once or didn't have them in the first place."" The mechanic called two places and told me it would cost $800 to get these installed. I told him I wasn't going to pay that because it's not a necessary expense and I wouldn't be able to afford it. At this point I asked if they had even tried filling up my tires with air; to which he told me no. A different mechanic then filled them up with air and told me that the light probably wouldn't go off because of the ""problem with the sensors."" A mile down the road with full tires the light went off! This was not quick or convenient and I do not appreciate men assuming that I do not know anything about cars in an attempt to get me to spend more money to repair problems that don't even exist! [REVIEW_2] This review is for their lunch menu as I have not tried their other offerings yet. If you are lucky enough to have lunch there during their 11-2 sandwich times; you are in for a real treat! The two sandwiches I have tried (the grinder and the southwesterner) were absolutely delicious! There wasn't a single taste bud that wasn't satisfied. It is pricey and sandwiches are a little on the small side but it is well worth it.   Can't wait to try (afford) their steaks!!  Food: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Price: 4/5 - A little high but great quality [REVIEW_3] I stayed here the night before my wedding with a few of my bridesmaids and the next two nights with my brand-new husband.  We stayed in the Santa Rosa cottage and it was amazing!  The room was spectacular; tons of room; the most comfortable bed EVER; and fantastic whirlpool bath and double shower.  The staff was wonderful; especially the front desk clerk (Karen? I think...cute blond woman; super helpful).  We had a complimentary basket of snacks in our room; which was wonderful when my girls and I were getting ready the day of the wedding.  The room was so beautiful and I loved the balcony...I know that our pictures will be terrific. I will always have so many good memories of this hotel and will definitely end up going back! [REVIEW_4] Store is severely understaffed Waiting in line to check out can take up to 25 minutes  Avoid this store if possible  The workers are nice; but they know they are understaffed to make the profits look better as a strategy [REVIEW_5] I stayed in a hotel with free breakfast but this place is worth it. The grits are nice and hot and the servers are friendly. The fresh squeezed juices are an excellent compliment to the food. My daughter got the veggie omelette and was also very pleased. [REVIEW_6] I used to really really like going to this Hardees. I liked Hardees breakfast menu a lot.  I even came here and spent close to $30 on breakfast items for St. Patrick's day.  All of that came crashing down one Saturday afternoon when the window checker never gave my debit card back to me (as I was distracted in my vehicle) and bought $140 worth of gas.  Thankfully my bank was able to stop any further transactions before they started buying flat screens at Best Buy. I won't risk using the drive thru here again. [REVIEW_7] Ordered from grubhub waited an hour and a half for delivery so I called naturally no one picked up for another 20 minutes then when the guy answers his explanation was that they were on break and hadn't made my order yet and gave me the "" oh well"" attitude and didn't offer any kind of compensation. [REVIEW_8] This place is VERY crowded and not in a good way - unless you enjoy smelling other people's BO while you eat and drink. Gag! I guess the smell of the patrons matches the smell of the bathrooms which are also gag worthy and dirty.   The prices aren't really great for the meh food available. Service was also meh. A few times we wondered if our server was every coming back. There are so many better options in Philly as a foodie city to try; so why waste your time and money here? Pass and head somewhere else. [REVIEW_9] Fantastic spot to sit down; cool down; and sip the best espresso in Indy. Lots of tables and super friendly and helpful staff. I would come back here again and again and again. I had the Italian macciado. It is very smooth and sweet. Expertly done. Thanks for the great time guys. [REVIEW_10] Over-priced and poor quality. I bought a 3k couch which took 12 weeks to build from BoConcept in Philly. The couch had structural problems after 3 months! Customer service was very disorganized and communicated very poorly. I would not buy anything from this company again. Horrible support; high prices and poor quality. STAY AWAY!",4
81,"[REVIEW_1] I would give them ZERO stars if it was possible. Bought my voucher through Groupon for the Drunk History Walking Tour. We scheduled an entire weekend in Philly around the tour. We do not live in Philadelphia; and we have a one year old son. My husband works the graveyard shift. Scheduling an entire weekend away is no easy task. We were so excited for this. Well; they cancelled our tour 24 hours before hand. 24 hours. Plus there were no other options for rescheduling that weekend. Not only that - their customer service is AWFUL. It is literally impossible to get anyone on the phone. We were told in the email when they cancelled the tour that it was from ""lack of interest."" Well when I was finally able to talk to a customer service rep through chat - before I even told her what tour had been cancelled she said; ""It was due to a tour guide emergency."" They can't even get their excuses straight! Luckily Groupon was nice enough to offer a refund in the form of Groupon Bucks (and they have wonderful customer service). But Best Tours is a joke. If you book a tour; don't bet on the fact that it will actually happen. Or god forbid plan a weekend getaway around it. [REVIEW_2] If you can't come to work with pride and energy and enthusiasm then don't work at a McDonald's where people are in a hurry to get somewhere else.....so disappointed in the behavior of humans! [REVIEW_3] So far I've been sitting here wanting to dine in for about 30 minutes and have yet to see a waitress. Had to finally get up from my table and go order a pizza and drinks from the front counter. There are two waitresses and about 5 tables of families. The waitresses are lazy and would rather stand around talking to friends than wait on a table. The girl just told the next family that came in here that it would be a better idea if they ordered to go than to dine in! LOL what a joke! This place is crap. Don't bother trying to eat here. Get delivery instead. [REVIEW_4] Had pulled pork with collard greens and sweet potatoe​  fries.  The pulled pork was tasteless and watery; the collard greens was hot. My wife sent her collard greens back and got onion rings;  which were ok. The sweet potatoes fries were ok as well. [REVIEW_5] Best buffet in Reno hands down.  Prices are very reasonable (even though I never pay since I'm always comped); service is always friendly; and the selection of food rocks.  I was just here like 4 months ago and the food offerings were different than the last time so they do change up the selections.  Highly recommend! [REVIEW_6] I haven't seen the book; but I think hotchickswithdouchebags.com is a hilarious website that.... Oops!  I forgot - this is a review for Pearl... in my defense; it's very easy to confuse the two.  I went to Pearl to see a DJ who I'd enjoyed at Silk City; but it was choch central and after one overpriced drink both my wallet and my soul were hurting. [REVIEW_7] If you want to eat at Prep & Pastry on the weekends; go right when it opens or before it closes. There is always a long wait because of how busy it gets - but the wait is always worth it. The food there is absolutely amazing. I go there often and love the green eggs & ham; bloody marys; and mimosas! They gave me a free pastry on my birthday once; it was delicious! I wish I remembered what it was called.   I also love that they serve EXO coffee here (a local coffee) - nothing better than a great breakfast with great coffee to go with it! [REVIEW_8] This is by far the BEST Indian restaurant I've gone to. We go almost every week. We are their BEST customer. I've tried about 6 to 7 Indian restaurants (in NYC; Canada; PA; etc..) and this is the best by far. Their service is consistently good and their food is ALWAYS EXCELLENT!   Some dishes worth trying: the Baingan Bhartha; the Chicken Tikka Masala; the Dal Makhni; the Lamb Karahi; the Lamb Seekh Kabab; and the Aloo Cholley. They also have wonderful Samosas.   Their lunch buffet is also AWESOME! They have a huge buffet with lots of variety from vegetables to goat to soup to desserts. They seriously have it all.   They are so nice and they are definitely worth a try if you have the heart to eat Indian food. You should definitely try it out. [REVIEW_9] This place is really; really good.  This is the only restaurant my Mexican boyfriend will eat at on Cherokee. Coming from San Antonio; I just refused to eat Mexican for a year after I got here. But Tarahumara is as real as it gets. As others have said; the menu is small but delicious. The salsa is awesome and the chips are hot. Everything is good and very home-style; the horchata is tasty; the gorditas are great. Ask for the sopaipillas; I'm not sure if they're on the menu but they ARE AMAZING - hot and crunchy and drizzled with dulce de leche. [REVIEW_10] This place was disgusting! We used to eat here quite a bit but it sure has gone downhill fast! The place was dirty (garbage cans overflowing; garbage left on tables because the garbage cans couldn't be used). Nothing was filled up (sauce cups; napkins; silverware). The chicken was very dry and couldn't even be cut with the plaatic knife! Well it was good while it lasted but they have seen the last of me!",4
82,"[REVIEW_1] This place is awesome ! The staff is amazing .. Love the authentic Italian food.. Best Pizza I ever had!! Gabby and Sheila were so polite and helpful in picking out some specials!! [REVIEW_2] Greta hike! Views ; desert fauna ; peace and quiet and more. It's not easy; bring the right shoes and water. The grandkids (5 &9 ) scampered up with much stress; wife had a bit more work.Park at top of Alvernon. [REVIEW_3] This place has the best Chinese food that I have had.  Strongly recommend Wonton in Chili Oil; 3 cup chicken; and Beef with Scallion.  Always order off the authentic menu. [REVIEW_4] This Starbucks always makes drinks correctly and the drive thru is fast... Even on busy mornings. [REVIEW_5] Consistent quality and service.  Love the #1 Deluxe.  Props to Amanda for excellent customer service; above and beyond! [REVIEW_6] Yum.  I love to swing by Smiley's on my way home from work and pick up a vegetarian falafel platter. Their falafel is perfection! Far; far better than Couch Tomato (no surprise there since this is a Mediterranean joint). Prices are fair; food is super fresh. Their hummus is silky with just a hint of lemon. Yes; carryout can take a little while but everything is made to order so I'm happy to wait or just call ahead. Do not miss this great little place!! [REVIEW_7] New favorite spot in Reno! Best muscles I've had in a sushi joint. Great menu options that aren't the same old rolls everywhere else has. The flavored sake drinks are good but extremely sweet; so be forewarned. Don't hesitate to check this place out. Great atmosphere and the best sushi! [REVIEW_8] What a dive! It took the new owners no time to return Kelly's back to its dive status of yesteryear. The food is so-so. It's dumpy and smelly. The floor is sticky. The tables and chairs are a mess. The silverware is grungy. Not fit for anyone but drunken college kids Best to go to a restaurant if you want to keep your appetite and eat. This is just a place to watch kids puke out front; if that's what you;re into. [REVIEW_9] Just found my new favorite place for pizza; didn't get any of the pizzas listed on the menu; built our own. Pepperoni; sliced red onions; roasted garlic. Was perfect; not too much cheese; the right amount of pepperoni; onions weren't over powering; and the garlic...oh yes; not your run of the mill minced garlic; but cloves of roasted garlic. All their pizzas are 10""; perfect amount for two; didn't try any of the appetizers; but I'm going to do their survey; and get one for free. Looking forward on going back....real soon. [REVIEW_10] I'm definitely a beginner when it comes to yoga but wanted to give it a try; and I'm glad I started here. Everyone is so nice and welcoming and the classes are extremely helpful. The instructors give a lot of personal attention to everyone in the class; which is extremely nice for beginners like me as well. I highly recommend trying one of the hot yoga classes one night for an awesome; sweaty workout.",9
83,[REVIEW_1] My go-to spot for low key take out/sit in sushi.  Excellent food; quick turn around and contemporary inside.  Highly recommend.  Only suggestion would be to add much more soy sauce packets in the to-go bag :) [REVIEW_2] The donair meat was very cheap tasting....like it came out of a can or something gross.   The place looks run down.  We won't be back.  People who think this is the best donair have lived a very sheltered life in the land of donairs!  This is probably one of my worst ones! [REVIEW_3] Came in to order coctel de camaron my food had no avocado no cilantro asked the waiter as to why it did not have it they said they were out of avocado and did not know why it had no cilantro. Just said ;I can take the plate back poor customer service it seemed like they didn't care. Very disappointing; how can a restaurant not have avocado and what's worst nobody seemed to care. I was so eager to eat this establish food now am just leaving wothout eating nothing. [REVIEW_4] I wish I had read the other reviews before setting this up for my friend.  Bottom line; she caught her plane; but very stressed.  Like other reviews; they scheduled the pickup 15 minutes later than requested; then arrived another 15 minutes after that. At another pick-up they couldn't find the passenger. In all 40 minutes late.  Given their history of such problems without improvement; this is simply no good. [REVIEW_5] Soooooo good! Tuesday is the night to go! Selection of 1/2 price tapas and Sangria/margaritas are $5.00.  We loved the Fried Manchego; Hot Cauiliflower; and Camarones!  This was over the top unique and tasty!! [REVIEW_6] Platoon is awesome and you definitely want Steve C as a trainer. When I started platoon; I was going once a week and attending a different group exercise class the other days of the week. After a few months; I was only coming to platoon 3-5 days a week. I loved how my workouts were customized to what I could do and wanted to do instead of a group workout that was impossible to complete. Steve is a great listener and motivator and sets realistic goals. The staff at platoon are very nice and accommodating. I never had a problem with billing or scheduling. [REVIEW_7] Very disappointing food.  Too bad I cannot give a minus 1 star. The food was just below average and overpriced. I know Good Peruvian food; I also know a bad imitation trying to pass for decent food. The bad service was also another disappointment. Overall this place gives Peruvian Cuisine a bad name. I will never return or recommend this place. [REVIEW_8] This company is difficult to deal with.  They promise more than they deliver.  The quality of their work is inconsistent.  I would not recommend them. [REVIEW_9] They guy behind the counter is not friendly or trustworthy; I had a feeling that they were trying to rip me off. I should haver read the reviews on yelp before going there. You would be better off going somewhere else. [REVIEW_10] I'm having a hard time finding something to complain about at this hotel.  Overall the hotel gets 5 stars; their restaurants would be a bit lower (more on them below).  My room was great-  very new; quiet; nice linens; very comfy mattress; great shower/tub and amenities. I had a city view room which was awesome.  But even the other side is nice with views of the White River.  See pics.  Hotel is only 9 months old I think.  Only thing that would have made it even better would be a fridge and microwave.    If you're going to a convention or a game the location is awesome.  It's connected to the convention center; which is connected to Lucas Oil Stadium; several other hotels; and the mall downtown.  You don't even have to go outside; which is great in bad weather.  Also walking distance to the minor league stadium; all museums; downtown; movie theatre; White River state park; and the zoo.  The staff was so helpful; polite; always smiling and friendly. There are 3 restaurants and a central bar.  High Velocity is a sports bar with tons of TVs; every major sporting even was on.  Food was just so so but service was excellent.  Osteria Pronto is Italian.  Not the best ever but pretty good; had their minestrone soup twice it was so good; and the gnocchi was pretty good. You can have a drink at the central bar area and order take out from Osteria Pronto.  That was a nice option to room service.  I didn't try the last place.    Had room service breakfast one day and it was awesome.  The fresh fruit plate was huge and delicious. 3 kinds of berries; two kinds of melons; pineapple; grapes; and yogurt.    Starbucks on the second floor next to the walkway to the convention center.  I did a lot of walking and dining in other hotels.  From what I see the JW is the newest and nicest. There are actually 3 Marriotts in a row; so make sure you pick the right one; the other two look a bit old.  Went to Shula's in the other Marriott for lunch; pretty good.  Went to the Capital Grill twice in the Conrad; really good.,4
84,"[REVIEW_1] I compare this hotel to a pig wearing lipstick.  It is still a pig.  Nice beds; yup; updated bathrooms; yes; new carpet in room; yes. Nice staff; yes. So why 1 star?  It is a dump and whoever decided to put all this new stuff into rooms that smell like mold and mildew should be fired. I am staying here for a convention so someone else booked the rooms as I usually look at reviews before making a reservation. Heading that it was a Marriott and that is was an Opryland hotel; I thought; oh it will be nice. After walking into the room and getting the nasty smell hit me; I turned to the Marriott app to look st the reviews as well as on yelp.  Many other complaints posted. I asked my co-workers and 3 of the 4 people that I am traveling with also have the same smell.   Note to the management team: shame on you for booking these rooms without fixing the problem. [REVIEW_2] I had the work done but after I did some research I could have got the work done much cheaper I will not use the ever again the are very high in price. [REVIEW_3] I went here today because all week I've been experiencing swelling in my wrists; neck; face; achiness and burning in my arm; and generally not feeling right. I did the usual paperwork; had to pay up front; which had I been able to pay afterwards. I probably would have left and gone to Lankenau. So; the MA who came in and asked me questions was cool; personable.... My blood pressure was insanely high; which I have never experienced before (168 over 135) and I got panicky; as the alarms and crap were dinging;... The MA definitely recognized my concern; and listened pretty well.  The Dr came in and I went  thru my list of symptoms and he totally blew me off; I  said even the fact my blood pressure was sky high wasn't a bit alarming;....He said no; I have anxiety. Made me out to be a hypochondriac; which totally isn't the case; I've fallen off rooftops and walked junk off like the queen of england. He then asks are you tired...Yeah I'm tired ; I work full time in a hospital and waitress part time; and I walk like a million miles a day; but I feel crappy now more so than usual.   He palpates my belly and asks a few more questions; then says well I think you may have mono.... But there isn't much we can do about that.... I asked if he could run an epstien barr heterophile blood test to see...He said it wasn't neccesary. Um....Ok. ""Tthere isnt much that we can do about that anyway""... Great. He says I strained my wrist. I'll get you an ace bandage....Well what about the mono possibility....ande the fact my blood pressure was insanely high....Once again he gives me this look like listen you dirty little tattooed hood rat...you have no idea what your talking about..... ""Your a perfectly healthy twenty seven year old. Your fine. You have anxiety problems; you checked off depression on your chart....."" Um. Ok. So I then wait half an hour for an ace bandage while the chick runs around bitching how they don't have any supplies; never can get anything done....(reassuring) I mean; to be fair; I probably could have gotten a better physical at my apartment considering I have a broken wheelchair;a blood pressure cuff; a buncha vacutainers; some cough syrup; and part of a trach tool kit (don't ask me and my brother work in healthcare;....and kinda hoard stuff...) So I finally get my ace bandage and ask the girl if she can take my blood pressure...SHe says she can't find a stethescope. I ask a dr passing by if he can and he pretty much laughs in my face. ""Aren't you leaving?""  Um; ok. ""why do you want your blood pressure checked?"" ""Because it was insanely high when I came in on the machine; and I was hoping a manual read would prove different"" So; in less than good humor; he pretends like he's checking my pressure (I know how to use a blood pressure cuff; he didn't set it on the right numbers or place the stethescope in the correct area....) He says  ""It's like 110 over 90. Why; do you feel ok?"" Whatta mess. For the record; my brother and boyfriend took my pressure; it's still high; and now I'm out 70 bucks and all I got was a steam punk piece of junk arm brace that I'll probably be wearing in a casket judging by these reviews. [REVIEW_4] Short and sweet - Been here three times and haven't been impressed. This last time I called in an order. The guy taking my order was rude and not helpful. I don't know the menu and asked him some questions and he knew about as much as I did. When arriving to pick up. Had to look for service. Was surprised by the 27$ bill for one entree. Got home; missing salad; over cooked steak; over cooked fries. Never again. Hope not everyone has that experience! Good luck.   P.S bring your cash cow. This place is PRICY especially for the quality of food [REVIEW_5] Stay away. My husband and I stopped here this afternoon to use a gift card given to us a long time ago. We do not normally buy cold stone ice cream; and we're pretty easy to please. All we were looking for was a nice cold treat on a hot day- what we got was a small ice cream that was way too sweet (yes; even for ice cream!); and a chocolate shake that was not good; for about $11. My husband took one sip of his shake and pushed it away. I took a taste and agreed that something was not right. It had a distinctly sour; bitter aftertaste. While I finished my ice cream; he debated about whether he wanted something else instead. Since the ingredients seemed to be the problem; he decided did not want something else; even though my ice cream seemed fine. When I took the shake back to the register and explained the problem; we were told we could not receive a refund; only a replacement. Both of us had an upset stomach for about two hours afterwards; and neither of us had more than a sip or two. Poor customer service; bad ingredients. Food poisoning is not worth $11; so we simply left.  Poor customer service is my biggest pet peeve- as someone who has worked in customer service and international sales for four years; I promise you- it's really not THAT difficult of a task to make sure your customer is happy; even if there is a language/geographical barrier (today; there was neither). While I realize that the employee I spoke to is probably a minimum wage high school student; store policies that young woman has to follow are set by real adults. Whoever set the policies for this store clearly is not doing their job!  Shame on you; coldstone; for trying to give my (active-duty & a veteran) husband food poisoning on Memorial Day; and refusing to make any real attempt to make amends. Don't worry; you sure as hell won't see us again; ever. Fool me once.... [REVIEW_6] In NO on business; and always try to eat where the locals do; or at least avoid the chains. This place came highly recommended. I was all set for a great breakfast; and was so disappointed. Took 30 minutes to get food; which was overcooked after sitting under heat lamps. Totally uninterested and full of attitude service. They were busy; so may have something to do with it; but I won't be back. [REVIEW_7] Ordered food at noon. Waited 55 minutes for two salads. Friend ordered House Salad; when it arrived it was spring mix; red onions; cucumbers. No cheese; bacon; tomatoes; pecans. When questioned; response was ""the chef changed it."" Without asking the customer?? And to what....the only items we have prepped? Asked for the manager but was told she was in the kitchen.  Guess that sums it up. Obviously will never go back.  One day later UPDATE: A marketing team member reached out to apologize and offered complementary meal as his personal guests should we want to try again. Hope this is indicative of a team trying to right the ship. Stay tuned. [REVIEW_8] I asked for a manicure gel nail and this is what I get. The paint is so sloppy and  did not clean around my nail whatsoever . I had to paid $40 for this; never going back there. [REVIEW_9] 0 Stars for customer service would be appropriate. The disaster they created for my daughter's confirmation cannot be put in words. Everybody is entitled to make mistakes even big ones it's how they handle them.  Allow me to describe the situation. It all started when we receive the Box minutes before our luncheon with somebody else's name on it. The cake didn't fit in the box so we walked across town with an open box.  When we open the Box it had our daughter's name on it however it looked like it was written by a first grader. None of the requested decorations including the Holy Cross and others were not included which was the purpose of the cake. The top it off the cake was  completely dry would have been better off with a cake from acme. The cake was loaded with these plastic sticks and I'm unsure why we counted over 40 of them; making it impossible to cut. We attempted to call master Baker several times and they were not open finally 2 weeks after the event were able to get ahold to somebody who could actually care less......"" said thank you for the learning experience we will discuss it are a next meeting."" That's it No desire to disgusted details and all they did was criticize us for waiting so long to get back to them when in fact they were never open when we called. We had photograph evidence of what they provided us still unwilling to listen.  Well Chad I can't believe you would treat customers like we were treated. [REVIEW_10] If you order the same type of meals they will make a meal for one and split the amount of meat with the 2nd platter. Yes they always short you out of your meat. Why the heck did we only have one strip of grilled chicken for each wrap. This is not the first time this happened either. Don't even bother to tip them because you will still be hungry and will have to eat again to satisfy your stomach.       When we all order separate meals or separate types of meals; we get the correct amount of meat and fries. Idiots",0
85,"[REVIEW_1] Mussels in coconut curry sauce were fantastic.  The scallops melted in your mouth. Excellent service and a very extensive beer and drink menu.  Don't  miss it if you are in philadelphia. [REVIEW_2] I was in town for business and after checking into my hotel; I searched for the closest BBQ place. I wasn't sure what I'd find at Hendricks but I was pleasantly surprised as I was driving through the neighborhood. I liked the small town feel. Since I was by myself; I had planned on taking it to go and eating at the hotel but after walking inside; I had to stay to enjoy the decor. Light bulbs in mason jars; flat screen TV's and an amazing lighted patio. Although the view is just a parking lot; it's too bad it wasn't closer to the river behind it or had something else to look at.   I ordered pork steak (which I've never heard of before) and it was really good. It looked like a T-bone but was tender enough to be cut with a fork. For my sides; I chose collard greens and cole slaw. The cole slaw was awesome. I have a weird ritual where I always order the cole slaw at different places to see how they make it. This one is definitely in my top 5. The slaw was finely chopped and had ground pepper in it; which I love. I usually put black pepper in my slaw anyways but this one was perfect. Cold and with a kick. Collard greens with a bit of bacon in it was good too. If I had more time or with a group of friends; I'd definitely come back because everything looked comfortably country. [REVIEW_3] Just moved into town and our family went for a bike ride.  Both my husband and myself had flats after about 15 minutes on the trail.  I called Eastside Cycles the next day and they fit me in...fixed both our bikes within a few hours.  amazingly fast and courteous.  great place! [REVIEW_4] I love these guys. Tony is one of big help. Had flat tire and he got it fixed less that what his estimation expectation.   Thank you!

This sushi is what dreams are made of!! The rolls and sauces are so unique and taste amazing. They are on the pricier side compared to your average sushi restaurant; but not by much. We are talking a $1-$3 increase per roll at Sakana. That few dollars is well worth the quality; taste; and experience a million times over. The rolls at Sakana are larger and more full of fish as well; so I get full faster. I cannot rave enough about this place. There's sometimes a long wait; because it is a small restaurant but it is worth it. Try going right at opening (5:00 on weekends) to be sat right away. Also- Merry Go Round Roll. You won't be disappointed. [REVIEW_7] I lived in Lincoln Green Apartments from September 2003 until June 2009.  1. I changed my apartment within the Lincoln Green as the water from the yard had destroyed the wall. The wall was wet for 3-4 month and the management failed fix it regardless of multiple inquiries. Finally they offered me to move to another apartment and did not compensate for the time and moving expenses. They did not even decrease the rate of the new apartment at least to the rate that I had been paying for the old one.   2. My expensive bicycle was stolen from the second floor balcony. All my attempts to ask for reasonable increased security in the community was useless.   3. When my rent was over; I washed the carpets and had one of the office employees come to inspect the apartment and sign off on my lease termination. I had about 100 Dollars security deposit that I never received back and because of my busy schedule; I did not really care to follow. However; a few years after; I noticed a ""Collection Notice"" on my credit report. As I investigated that; I realized that the Lincoln Green Apartment had reported me to Collection Agency for what they said ""  150 Dollars fee for not washing the carpet"". They had never contacted me although they had my new address; email; and phone number. They reported me to collection agency for only 50 dollars. When I contacted them; I faced bunch of rude people with no respect; what so ever; to a customer. As soon as they realized that I am not looking for rent; they hung up the phone on me.   4. If you walk (not jump) in your apartment or watch TV after 9 pm; don't be surprised to get a knock on the door by your neighbors.   Two of my friends who also lived in Lincoln Green Apartments had similar experience.  I strongly discourage renting the Lincoln Green Apartments for the following reasons:   1. Disrespectful and rude employees and managers 2. Their abuse of having the SSN of the tenants. 3. Their inadequate care for apartment issues 4. Poor security.  5. Very poor sound proofing of the walls which transmits every single sound to all neighbors.   If you have any question or concerns; please feel free to email me:  Kambiz  kambizpa@yahoo.com [REVIEW_8] Cute; lovely place in a hidden location! The service was great and the owners were lovely. Had the chicken and waffles and it was AMAZING!! 10/10 would eat here when I'm in town again! [REVIEW_9] Morgan and Stayci not only have very warm and gentle personalities; the environment of the salon is lighthearted and relaxed for your pet to spend an hour getting fed a few treats; being loved while getting a sharp; stylish; functional cut. They are the most wonderful women and my puppy loves how he looks when he leaves...I'm never taking my baby anywhere else! [REVIEW_10] I can't believe that I haven't yet written a review for this place. I've been coming here since they opened this place and immediately loved it! Here is where I was introduced to the Panang Curry. Definitely one of the best in town. Also they have a dish called Mee Kati that I have never seen at any other restaurant. I tried that as well and it is a great dish. It's a sweet dish so I prefer to add spice to it. I have never had Thai home cooking but I feel as if this is what it would be like. It's family that works here and from what I was told they eat what they make because it is what they would do at home so that says a lot to me. Their Thai tea is excellent but I think their iced coffee is even better.  The staff is always great and it is a very strong reason why I keep coming back. They keep the place tidied up as well. No doubt a place to check out if you're in the area; and if you're not; make your way out here.",9
86,[REVIEW_1] Always good food! The grilled fish is one of our favorites!  Prices are reasonable too! [REVIEW_2] Here visiting and looking for a good breakfast place! This place is so cute it's hidden so not so easy to find unless you know but once you do you'll be happy you found it! They have all organic foods and Turkish coffee which was cool to try and was good. I also got the sunset smoothie which was very good and the silver dollar pancakes with eggs. Everything was good and service was good! Would def recommend! [REVIEW_3] Awful awful awful went in today to have lunch with my husband we ordered we get to the register and they inform us there's no ice for the drinks we ordered do we still want them I say yes because I made the wrongful assumption that the soda would at least be cold and drinkable boy was I wrong not only was it hot but it had no carbonation what so ever. Now mine you we paid for these drinks I don't know about you but I've worked in the food industry and my store has ran out of ice before and we went to the grocery store and bought bags of ice brought them back and made sure our customers were happy until we could fix the situation apparently that was not the managers idea at this store. So instead of just saying sorry our drink situation sucks today u can have it for free they charge us. I went to 5 guys and got us cold drinks we started eating our burritos were disgusting they tasted like cat food and the chips were completely plain no lime or salt at all! Clearly someone has dropped the ball at this chipotle because it was complete garbage! I hope they can turn this store around because they've now lost a customer [REVIEW_4] We recently had our car serviced and the staff was friendly and efficient. I was taken care of by someone right away. Quick; nice and fair. What more can you ask for!  Great people and great service. [REVIEW_5] Called in to get service information on my 2015 $110K AMG. Was told since I didn't purchase the vehicle at their dealership that I would have to pay for a loaner car for warranty work. Will be staying far away from here. [REVIEW_6] We loved it there. Went Saturday night with 3 people and even though WE messed up the reservation (we only said it was 2 not 3 of us) they accommodated us right away. The food was delicious and even though we were the last guests after a while they didn't try to get us out but chatted with us. Great service; great food; perfect I say! If George is around you are in great hands [REVIEW_7] Great combination of Japanese and Korean food. The Sushiya roll and the curry kutsu are my favorite in the menu! Everything I've tried so far tastes fresh and flavorful. For sure my go-to Asian spot in IV [REVIEW_8] I love coming in here for a gel mani; it always lasts more than 2 weeks and I'm pretty rough with my nails.  Sophia is my favorite nail tech; she is very sweet and does a fantastic job. [REVIEW_9] We actually come here often for different products; however this place needs a lot of work or different management. The management hides in the little office and never comes out to help regardless of people needing help. They need several more employees and I've sent several of my students from UNR needing part time orfull time but the hiring process is so crazy nobody's interested! Lastly most bathrooms at the gas stations are cleaner than this bathroom. It's crazy filthy. And this is supposed to be kind of a professional place. We've been coming here for a long time and these observations are over a period of consistent observation. I just finally decided to write a review. I think we will switch to the mud town location. [REVIEW_10] I love this little place.  It's a dive bar full of great staff and customers around the bar.  The menu includes several vegetarian items; as do the daily specials.  The soups are fantastic.  Did I mention that Flanagan's is open 24 hours?  Plus!,7
87,"[REVIEW_1] Pulled pork and fried fish are great.    Don't miss the sweet tea.  My wife had the white beans and cold slaw really good much better than my Mac and cheese and potatoe salad.    But a must eat if you love bbq. [REVIEW_2] I had the carrot cake.... Very disappointed tasted like licorice and baking soda cooking powder. It's too bad because everything looks so delicious :( also didn't like the chocolate chips in it either. [REVIEW_3] Charles (the owner) was more than happy to bring my wife's old bike back to life. Turn around was only 2 days and price was very affordable. They are a family owned AND family run business. Can't get more ""mom and pop"" than this place. Will definitely be going back for future tune ups. [REVIEW_4] I walked in at 9:30 on a Tuesday and the owner told me they were closed. They need to change the hours online and lock the doors when they're closed. [REVIEW_5] Our server; Julliette; was very very nice to the children and draws a very good ketchup blowfish. [REVIEW_6] Terrible service. Called in an order for pick up and completely butchered my order. I asked for a half sausage half cheese pizza and felt like he had no clue what i was saying as i had to constantly repeat myself. i had my boyfriend call back to make sure the order was right and he repeated back the order that i ordered half sausage half BEEF??? So after we corrected him and picked up or pizza; we got back and opened it up and it was ALL SAUSAGE. This is the second time in the past month i have had terrible service. The first time i got there for pickup and they had completely forgotten to put my order in. Terrible. [REVIEW_7] Amazing burgers; craft beers; specialty cocktails and homemade ice cream desserts.  The burgers you have choices of substituting beef; chicken; lamb or bison. They put a spin on everything...even the ketchup. They even have a weekly burger battle where the most ordered burger lives on another week to get challenged by another special contender.   My son and I spilt a banana split that was simply incredible. A scoop of triple chocolate and one of coconut crunch with a caramelized banana...get outta here!!! You know the melty part of a banana split at the bottom of the bowl that nobody likes...we didn't find it here!!!! [REVIEW_8] After my last visit I said I wouldn't go back here again; but sadly I found myself needing a doctor over Memorial Day weekend and didn't want to go to an ER.   I sat in the waiting room for 20 minutes before leaving without being seen. It seems that even though they were open; the doctor decided not to show up. I did a Google search and found a different clinic that took my insurance. I had to drive half an hour but I was seen by a doctor.  I will never go to Advanced Urgent Care again. I'd rather drive a half hour and know I'll have good service than drive five minutes for nothing. [REVIEW_9] So I went to this fine establishment yesterday after a night out on the town. Was looking for some quality pizza and possibly some wings. The wait was a little long but not terrible considering the night rush. I got a large pepperoni and a dozen wings with a side of hot sauce. Everything sounds great right? Pizza tastes good; wings taste good. Me being slightly... buzzed thought nothing of the bill... after all my main mission was to get Pizza. It wasn't until I collected myself this morning that I realized how ridiculous it was that I spent 32 bucks on a pep pizza and a dozen wings. I think you guys can do the math. I got fleeced in my moment of drunkin pizza need. Anyway; go next door. These guys can't operate like decent human beings. I'm sure the owner will read this so my message is: yeah we might be drunk when we order but we remember the next day and apparently this isn't an isolated event according to my friends. Deuces. (Drops mic) [REVIEW_10] My brother came to visit and we wanted to pick up a six pack of good beers for a night in. Ended up staying and having a few while playing their Nintendo 64 (Super Smash Brothers; which the owner said was donated by fellow patrons). It's a great place with good food and genuinely nice people. Should be a staple in the Northeast.",5
88,[REVIEW_1] Over priced.  Over rated.  Totally disappointing.  No jelly donuts.  How can any self respecting donut place not have a jelly donut? Luckily the coffee was decent. [REVIEW_2] Great clams! Great drinks and great service; thanks Matt T! Wonderful night with family [REVIEW_3] Absolutely horrible food. The place was dirty and smelled. I ate here once and never again. Not too mention staff was very rude and unprofessional. Dont waste your time or money. I wouldn't even give one star... [REVIEW_4] I have tried this place twice ever and it was disgusting and greasy both times. Won't go back.. [REVIEW_5] Three chances and they are out! We tried to like this place as the location is easy and convenient. The bar is great; the staff friendly; but there is not a dish I have tried that is passable (although the asian shrimp wasn't bad; but very sweet). First visit we wrote off as a new restaurant working out the bugs. On our second visit I ordered a turkey burger and received a dry turkey patty. No one informed me that they were out of buns; but they could have at least tried to dress it up. It was seriously a lone piece of ground meat (to their credit; the manager did comp that meal). Today we received fish and chips that had to come out of a box and chicken salad that could have greased my axles!  We won't be back. [REVIEW_6] Overpriced and pretentious...this outfit charges 2x the normal price for everything.  Didn't try all of the 17 restaurants; but what I did have was just average.   Rooms weren't even as nice as the much lower priced Hampton Inn.    Cannot express how disappointed I was.  Seemed like if you just looked at something they charged you for it.    The interior gardens were nice but really not worth it. This is Disney World for adults [REVIEW_7] I would not recommend this hotel as my experience here was not the best experience as my room was accessed and items stolen.  Not a safe place to stay! [REVIEW_8] Went to this store for an alignment;  when I parked the mechanics were just sitting with no work to do. At 8:30 this is not a good sing for the shop. They checked my vehicle and then notified me at I needed approx $1500.00 in repairs. They even said things that were just replaced needed to be replaced. Drove to my normal mechanic and only needed 2 parts for about 1/6 of the price.  Would not go to this place again. [REVIEW_9] so we ordered brisket sandwiched from here waited forever for it to arrive and when the food came they had run our of brisket and given us roast beef instead. They never bothered to tell us that and some of the order was wrong completely. we called them and said they would remake the wrong items not the roast beef and they wanted the food back. the staff were very rude [REVIEW_10] If you like to wait while several tables are open;  terrible service; a dirty restaurant; and very mediocre food that is overpriced for breakfast then you'll love this place! This was one of the worst breakfasts I've ever had. With First Watch around the corner and Pinky's up the street don't waste your time here. I know what you're thinking...but Todd First Watch and Pinky's are way more expensive....Bullsh#t. don't waste your time on this old broken down dump.,1
89,[REVIEW_1] We enjoyed this ride during the first week of May.  Captain Mike and his Boston Sidekick were great to be around.  They were knowledgeable about the area and kept everyone happy/entertained.  The boat was fast and when it turned; passengers could be seen feeling the effects of the G's.  In total; it was a great ride with a fun crew.  We would definitely recommend this ride and do it again. [REVIEW_2] By far the best we experienced in Santa Barbara and it was the only free historic visit. Highly recommend. The view from the tower is beautiful. [REVIEW_3] There are a lot of rather middling restaurants in kirkwood so I was very pleasantly surprised when this place turned out to be very good. We came at a bit of an off time but had exceptional service. My husband had a delicious and generously portioned fish and chips sandwich (it was huge). I had a Burger. I really wasnt expecting much but it was juicy and flavorful despite the fact I ordered it medium well (I know I know). Everything was tasty; the atmosphere was very pleasant and the staff were great. [REVIEW_4] Great wings and atmosphere!! Gone quite a few times and have received consistently great service; beer; and food. [REVIEW_5] We have used this company and referred clients several times...easy to work with; professional drivers and great cars and service... [REVIEW_6] Outstanding food and decor. This place is a gem. I would drive over here from San Francisco to eat. It is that good. I will definitely be back. [REVIEW_7] Delicious; good customer service and they place is always clean. What's not to love?! If you get a medium; you can select 2 flavors. [REVIEW_8] This is my happy food! The outside of the building and interior are nothing special; but don't let that throw you off. The food in incredible. I have eaten in and had take out from the steam table. Both are very good; but I agree with Brian R try the Hung ray curry and the disco chicken are not to be missed.  The staff is very friendly and attentive. The prices are also very reasonable. [REVIEW_9] Oh... my.... god.... incredible!!! You will not regret it!!! There's always a long line; and it's worth the wait!!! Be adventurous and try as many pancake flavors as you can; they won't disappoint!  10/10 best pancake place around!! It's a must!! [REVIEW_10] ROB IS THE BEST! A lot of regulars hangout here! Mostly older crew; but depending on the night there's young folks too! It is a VERY comfortable bar; friendly family atmosphere!  One of the three bars in Carmel you can actually smoke in! It's a plus if your a smoker-if not don't bother going. You will leave smelling like smoke! They also have pool leagues; and they are very competitive! Come play! There is also darts and pull tabs!!! If you like to sing come on a Saturday night; they do karaoke and have about every song you can think of! Come sing! It's all around one of my favorite bars in Carmel; if you haven't been come in and check it out!  Ask for Rob at the bar; he will take care of you with fast and friendly service! And if your lucky he will entertain you with his corny jokes!,10
90,"[REVIEW_1] They are dirty; have very bad service; they are very distracted. They stop during your mani + pedi to help someone else for 15 min at a time. Took almost 2 hrs for me and a friend to get a mani pedi; and not because they were being attentive. Would not recommend; will not go back. Tina's Nails is awesome. [REVIEW_2] The quality and diversity of the menu for the price is hard to beat  in Nashville. The Uruguayan and Argentinian menu is very accessible and delicious. Plenty of meat for the fellas. The dulce de leche deserts are cant miss and you have to start with empanadas. The staff was very welcoming and made us feel like regulars. [REVIEW_3] This store feels like home. Or at least it feels like MY home. Time doesn't seem to pass normally here; and every time I walk out I'm always amazed to realize how long I was actually browsing vintage sci-fi paperbacks or leafing through that illustrated edition of Nostromo or just being constantly distracted by 'hey; what's that...' So much of my childhood was spent happily drifting through cluttered; old-timey used bookstores like this; but they're fast becoming an endangered species. I'm glad Philly has this one. [REVIEW_4] This place is truly a hidden gem. It's in the basement of Suburban building so a little hard to find but worth the effort. It is small but wonderfully decorated. Lots of polish choices and a friendly staff. They don't chit chat among them selves but do engage customers in conversation. [REVIEW_5] My girlfriend and I had the best time here!  Definitely the most fun and relaxed place for wine tastings. Great wines with good prices. We will for sure be back. [REVIEW_6] I love my  curly perm from Shine hair & nails ! Thanks Harvey! You're the best! :D [REVIEW_7] Great breakfast! I had the egg; sausage; bacon; hash and short stacks! One of the best breakfast places I've had since Kirby Lane in Austin; TX! We will eat there again before we leave NOLA! [REVIEW_8] We have been to Tre scallini many times and have recommended it to many friends simply because the food is delicious!  However last night after driving an hour + to get there our reservation for 8 people was lost. We were asked if we were at the right restaurant; why we came if we didn't get a confirmation call...then miraculously our name was found but had been canceled???  Never once an I'm sorry or a let me see what I can do???  After telling the woman she very rude...she told me I was attacking her???  Funny on our way out...the next couple's reservations were lost as well!  Perhaps a new method other than a scibbled piece of scrap paper is needed....needless to say we will not be back! [REVIEW_9] This place is top notch; with phenomenal service and such fantastic ambiance- how can you go elsewhere? All of the food looked and smelled amazing. I love how creative everything was. I CANT STOP DAYDREAMING ABOUT THE FOOD. Hands down; best brunch experience of my life. I don't even like french toast usually and theres was by far the most delicious food thats ever entered my mouth. I am literally drooling while writing this. The chicken and waffles were unreal and standout A++++.  I love the ""flinstones pushup-pop"" drink so creative and clever. Even the deviled eggs were the best I've personally ever had. They do everything right even when it comes to the music. It was super fun and such a great experience! Ignore any review thats not 4 stars because they must be delusional. [REVIEW_10] Ordered food at noon. Waited 55 minutes for two salads. Friend ordered House Salad; when it arrived it was spring mix; red onions; cucumbers. No cheese; bacon; tomatoes; pecans. When questioned; response was ""the chef changed it."" Without asking the customer?? And to what....the only items we have prepped? Asked for the manager but was told she was in the kitchen.  Guess that sums it up. Obviously will never go back.  One day later UPDATE: A marketing team member reached out to apologize and offered complementary meal as his personal guests should we want to try again. Hope this is indicative of a team trying to right the ship. Stay tuned.",7
91,"[REVIEW_1] I'm here right now; listening to pretty offensive rap.  Ugly b*tches; hoes; F bombs....  very disappointing.  I'm open minded and listen to all sorts of stuff; but this is pretty out of control. [REVIEW_2] OK; I'm going to be Debbie Downer.  Awful coffee. Just awful.  Maybe that's not fair. I have yet to sample all of their fare; and perhaps it's a bad idea to fit them into the mold that Mugshots (which was gone before I arrived in Manayunk) occupied. But in the end; they call themselves a cafe; which translates into a coffee shop; moved into the location of a former coffee shop and they include baked goods and coffee on the menu; so I feel comfortable in holding them to some standard.  They were out of their banana bread. All of it. For all the flavors they described; they didn't have a single one left when I arrived. This is a significant portion of their menu; and they were out of all of it; which tells me that they have problems with keeping things in stock They had plenty of Baklava; but I'm allergic to two of the nuts they use in them; so even experimenting is a horrible idea.  There was a small child running around screaming; and I could hear arguing breaking out as I stepped through the door with my coffee. I'm not saying that without empathy; but that is never something you want your customers getting to be a part of. Even if the food had been perfect; it would have detracted from the experience  And...the coffee...I have to  go back to that. I really do. If I has handed a mug of Starbucks and was told that someone had urinated in it; and my only other option was what I had here...I would seriously have to debate that decision. This is a horrible thing to say. It's cruel; and cruel honestly isn't that much more helpful than well meaning lies. It's even more horrible to look at in the cold light of day; and determine that it's still a correct assessment. But this is someone who; during his broke college days; would drink coffee through day old grounds. Someone who used an abandoned French press that was held together with duct tape; and I couldn't finish it. Seriously; it was that bad. I don't know how they did it; and that cup was an accomplishment in of itself.  Maybe the owners are nice folk. Maybe; their Mediterranean food is really good; as other reviews seem to indicate. But they sure as shit ain't a cafe. If they want to be cheery; and have great falafel; they should do that. But dear God in heaven; who I have forsaken in so many ways; they put something on the menu so bad I am still  shocked. Combined with a lack of stock and that atmosphere; I can't possibly give this place a good rating. [REVIEW_3] We went on a Wenesday 6/6/18 @ 9:20pm  for endless wings! Everything was normal then we found a folded up receipt in our coke under the ice. I already took two sips into it! I was so shocked that they missed this. Unexceptionable I can't imagine where it came from. The only logical explanation is this is a coke from a customer that left and they folded their receipt and tossed it in their drink. Do Hooters re use their cups without washing it or tossing whatever was in it? I brought this up to our server ""savannah"" and she played it off! Stated ""wow that never happens it's usually bugs or something in it"". I don't know what type of explanation or apology that was. If I eat at a restaurant I am expecting clean and delicious food with service; I did not get it at this Hooters. [REVIEW_4] Went to Winco to purchase my weeks worth of groceries; It was about 6pm on a weekday. Spent about 45 minutes to an hour picking out my items; stood in a long line for about 20 minutes; when I got to the front of the line the cashier turned off her light and said I'm closed but were opening another check stand one over. Everyone that was behind me ran to the new checkstand and I was left in the back of the line for a 2nd time. Now it took 40 minutes to check out instead of 20. When I got home my ice cream was all melted. If this happens again I will walk out and let them put the groceries away. [REVIEW_5] Excellent bar in Ybor city. The owner and staff are unmatched in Tampa. Cleanest place in Ybor. They did a superb job of hosting a charity event for cancer survivors tonight; thank you for your hospitality. [REVIEW_6] This place is right down the street from my apartment. They make a really good cocktail; The Cherry Blossom; with fresh ingredients everytime. They squeeze the limes right in front of you; no concentrate crap.  The owner was standing at the bar one night talking to all the customers and gave me a free shot of saki which was really nice! Everyone there is really friendly and no one ever seems stressed out at all ever! No matter how busy it is and how demanding you are they're always smiling and happy to help. [REVIEW_7] My personal favorite wine and liquor store in Nashville.  The staff is usually very friendly and helpful without being pretentious.  You can ask for a $10 dollar bottle of wine recommendation without being scoffed at.  The selection is good and the prices are comparable with other liquor stores in town.    One negative; the curb is a little bit high pulling in.  Don't gun it unless you want to scrape some rust off of the bottom of your car. [REVIEW_8] This is the best Barber shop in the city.   If you've been to Aidan Gil in the last 7 years; chances are you got your hair cut by one of these barbers. Sarah; Nate; and Mike have been delivering the freshest haircuts to Aidan Gil customers for the better part of a decade; and now they have their own shop. They are all great barbers and great people.   The atmosphere is light and fun; it's like you're getting your haircut in your friend's living room. The haircuts are always on point; the fades tight; and the shaves close.   Go in; get a drink; relax and watch some TV while you wait; refill your drink and enjoy your cut/shave. [REVIEW_9] How can I many ways can I say awful? Let's start with the loud country music on the sound system. The music was annoying  at the level it was set at. I should not have to raise my voice to have a conversation with the person across the table. The decor is a reused wood interior. It reminded me of a wooden cave. Dark and monochromatic. Not attractive.  My wife  ordered the brisket for lunch with mac and cheese and steamed veggies. I ordered the breakfast burger. My wife's entree came with more bbq sauce on the plate than meat. There were 4 skimpy pieces of brisket. It was hard to determine if the brisket was good because of the amount bbq sauce the.meat was swimming in. The bbq sauce tasted as if it was off the shelf KC's Masterpiece or Kraft.  It should have come on the side so the patron could decide how much or little was appropriate for their taste. The mac and cheese was bland and lacked the taste of cheese. Bad bad bad.  The burger I ordered was supposed to be done medium. Instead I got a lump of meat charcoal on a roll. The Sous or chef should be  ashamed of themselves for presenting this in the window for service. This is cooking 101.  The service was painfully slow. I could understand if the place was jumping; but my wife and I were the only food patrons.  Avoid this place. The closing of this place cannot come soon enough. [REVIEW_10] I went to this location because it's easy to get in and out even tho it is a busy corner. This is my second visit. My first visit was mediocre. The woman who assisted me was not really friendly (sorry I didn't get names at either visit) but was helpful and professional. My second visit I was assisted by a different woman who was also helpful; knowledgeable and professional. I realized the women were not being rude; they are just quiet. Neither woman made small talk but answered every question I had.  Now my second visit deserved 5 stars. I normally pack things myself and just need it shipped; but I was shipping a skateboard and could not box it correctly. The woman went above and beyond to help me and she offered more assistance than was professionally required.  I will return to this location for all my shipping needs. The store is clean; and packs (no pun intended) a lot of product into a small space. The staff is knowledgeable. They have boxes; packing materials; and offer copying services. You may not get a big smile and a lot of small talk; but you will get the highest level of service. In my opinion.",5
92,"[REVIEW_1] Long time regular of Hooters in the Florida and now defunct Ohio areas and had to visit this one when visiting friends in Arizona.   Ordered a pitcher of beer and 10 minutes later told I cannot have one alone.  That's ok   I remember living in Ohio the Hooters up there never gave someone drinking solo a pitcher   was just policy    even seen same policy in some Tampa stores   AFTER THIS ALL DOWNHILL.   Waitress must have thought we were mad and sent a manager over    I explained it is no problem and I seen the policies before   he then corrected saying it is a state law in a firm tone.  Ok  I was educated   very cool    he then had to be a know it all and tell me that the Hooters ANYWHERE never had a policy about pitcher serving and he knew cause he worked with the company 10 years.   LISTEN  NOW YOU MADE AN ISSUE OF A NON ISSUE;   it was the way they were in Columbus ohio!!!!!   Experienced it many times  I Did not care for the vinegar based hot sauce; and  then mr ""know it all"" had to speak up again saying Florida will be switching soon from butter to vinegar so get used to it.  Have since found from 2 Florida IMPORTANT HOOTERS MANAGEMENT PEOPLE that 1  they will never change over and 2 Other one says they are really fighting it.  The outspokeness of this manager really ruined a visit and overshadowed our very nice and sweet waitress    she was one of twins   cannot remember name though.  Beautiful store just try not to engage manager  #WillRegret [REVIEW_2] Came in for the beer and a burger lunch venture. When looking at the beer menu; I wanted to try a little of everything. That's when I was suggested the flight. Which is a series of different 4ounce beers brought to the table to sample. Not a bad start.   I then ordered the the butcher burger which had a combination of ground short rib; brisket and chuck. That's when I was sent onto another world of palate satisfying comma. This is the spot for a good variety of beers and good food. Will come again to try other things on the menu.   Great job guys! [REVIEW_3] Horrible disgusting not sure how they are even open. Food tasted old and was served cold and had zero taste. [REVIEW_4] I've ordered pizza here twice because I am in the neighborhood. Both times have been awful. Today; the dough on my pizza was literally raw. I really want this place to suceed; but the pizza is not good. [REVIEW_5] I had a random day off so; while I made other stops; grabbing a Kien Giang banh mi for lunch was really the sole purpose for my 1.5 hour drive to Nashville. It's that good. I've only tried a handful of other items; but they were all also very tasty.   Another bonus: I could certainly do it.. but spending $25 for food and drinks for two would be a stretch.   Also; they only take cash or checks so be prepared. [REVIEW_6] I'm almost thankful that there is usually a line for this place.  If there was not; I would eat here daily; and become obese.  I've only been here once; but my friend and I tried 4 different kinds of pancakes.  We had banana bread (probably our favorite; the famous sweet potato; raspberry; and chocolate chip.  All of them were awesome. We also felt the need to eat potatoes and bacon.. Because night shifters are ravenous when they get off work in the morning.  Just take everyones word for it and eat here and then take the rest of the day off to recuperate from your food coma. [REVIEW_7] Service was GREAT! Food....meh. Jambalaya was almost room temperature and no okra at all. Won't be back. [REVIEW_8] Love their pasta  feast on Sunday night :) You order it for at least  two people  and you get a big bowl of five different pasta  dishes. Delicious  :) [REVIEW_9] I am visiting from Chicago and stopped for dinner.  Food is VERY salty which any Thai cook will tell you is a big no no.  It is more Chinese style on stir fry's and they burned the fried rice.  Service very slow also. [REVIEW_10] Is this place even open anymore? I live literally a block around the corner and I walk by here a minimum of once a day; usually during times when the posted hours say it should be open and it NEVER is. If it WAS open I would probably be a regular; but I have yet in six months to set foot inside.",4
93,"[REVIEW_1] Gaetano's used to be one of the better spots in the area (not saying much) to grab a good quick lunch. I'd stop in here roughly once a week to grab a sandwich off of their lunch special menu that rotated daily.  Well they completely ruined that. Gone is the rotating; reasonably priced lunch menu. They've since replaced it with a menu that isn't even worth ordering off of. They regularly had specials of sandwiches; wraps; and salads on the lunch menu for under $7 that came with chips/fries and a drink. All but one item on the menu includes a drink now and I just paid $9.01 for a buffalo chicken wrap; tiny bag of chips; and soda I had to buy separately. Whoever made it must have missed the memo on how to assemble it because it didn't have the crisp lettuce and tomato inside of mine that was stated on the menu. I got a $9 wheat wrap stuffed with a pathetic amount of chicken and nothing else. It was smaller than the premade Wawa wraps. Huge change in what Gaetano's used to be; their portion sizes were always their strong point.  I posted a picture a while ago of a meatball sandwich lunch special I got before they started cheaping out on their offerings. I wish I took a picture of my pathetic wrap today; they couldn't look more different. I didn't have time however because it took about 12 minutes to come out and some of us don't have all day.  I'll be looking elsewhere during my lunch break. [REVIEW_2] I chose Delicious Designs based on the excellent reviews I found on Yelp and I am so very pleased with the results. Leigh Anne kept in constant contact with me about details and the end result was fabulous! Of course I had a special request...that's why I chose to do some investigating. The comments people make mean alot to me and I am very happy that she was able to make (and deliver) my special cake which was a law book with a gavel and tassle. Typically meant for a law student's graduation but we used it to celebrate an attorney's 40 year anniversary. Everyone loved it and asked who made it so a polite suggestion Leigh Anne; when you make cakes from now on; turn it in with a few of your business cards so that the host can hand out your card when people want to know who made it. Ours was white cake with fresh strawberries in a strawberry mousse filling. It was delicious! Thank you so much for all your hard work. You will be hearing from me again. [REVIEW_3] Small portions. High prices      The food here is overpriced for the small amount of food they give.  In the seafood combo. They advertise as if it is a generous amount of food and when it comes they give you 4 shrimp.  How cheap and ridiculous.  The poboy is more bread than shrimp. If they want to charge high. They need to give you more food.  Avoid this place.  It will just piss you off. [REVIEW_4] The food has no flavor whatsoever. Their ""queso"" is nacho cheese sauce. I would go to Taco Bell before I would go back here. [REVIEW_5] terrible food and the manager was shockingly rude when I tried to return my food. I had the frogs legs and they were rubbery and tasted awful. I was disgusted by her behavior and she should be ashamed of herself. I have never been treated more horribly by someone. [REVIEW_6] Food is expensive and not worth it. My hubby had carnitas - very dry. I had the scallops- expensive and undercooked. Not even a browned crust. Rice was served ""family style "" but do mushy and overlooked. I had a mango margarita that was completely bland and flavorless. We will not be going back. City fish was not good; but this is worse. And so disappointing- the idea of fresh quality Mexican food could have been so good. [REVIEW_7] This may actually be the worst falafel pita sandwich I have seen in my life. I have eaten a lot of falafel. To pay upwards of five dollars for this is absolute robbery; and they would never get away with it off campus. IV Deli Mart's falafel isn't even that great; but it shines in comparison to this. Do not go here. [REVIEW_8] Horns gets one star for the waitress with the amber necklace... she was fabulous.  If not for her cheerful friendly demeanor and attention it would have been no stars.  Burned pancakes  that tasted sour.  The kitchen obviously didn't care about the product they sent out. [REVIEW_9] To start off: I have never left a bad review before. It's usually not worth the effort; and if I don't like a restaurant I simply won't go back. But this place... my goodness. Easily one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had.   Ordered the Veggie Benedict; but asked if I could have it with egg whites. The server was puzzled and said that it already came with egg whites. Ok no big deal; it was strange that it wasn't listed that way on the menu but whatever. The server comes back a couple minutes later: ""It does come with normal eggs! All this time I thought poached eggs meant egg whites."" Uh; ok. A bit odd for a server at a restaurant that literally specializes in eggs; but still not an issue. She asks if I do indeed want the egg whites; and I say yes. A couple more minutes pass; and she comes back. ""Our kitchen doesn't know how to poach egg whites; so if you want them they'll have to scramble them."" What?? You poach an egg white just like you poach an egg. But whatever; I don't care that much so; ""Sure; that's fine.""  It took us a very long time to get our food. The restaurant was not busy. Empty tables; no wait.  Finally our food comes out; and what do you know it's cold. Not just room temp. Cold. We mention it to the server who proceeds to tell us it's because the restaurant doesn't use heat lamps because ""they have so many hands."" Apparently not enough hands to get the food out within a half hour; and to get it out warm.   On to the food itself. I ordered what should've been a relatively healthy; easy meal. I got a plate that was literally covered in so much oil that my bennies were swimming. We're talking greasier than the greasiest Chicago pizza; but not due to fat from sausage or cheese. Oh no. There is no reason it should've been greasy at all; since all it had was spinach; wild mushrooms; asparagus; and tomatoes. It was literally just vegetable/canola oil. Even the side salad was drowning in its oily dressing. It was to the point that my own mother commented that if it had been her food; she wouldn't have touched it. We're not picky eaters; we eat anything and everything. So I proceeded to try some of my cold; oily concoction and unsurprisingly it tasted like nothing. It was so oily that none of the flavors of the vegetables could come out; and left my mouth; lips; and even fingers shining. And the hollandaise... oh god. What should've been a nice lemony-buttery sauce was a blob with the consistency of expired box pudding. Skin and all. And it tasted like nothing I've ever had before... maybe similar to cheese wiz? The stuff in a can? Yeah.   With all of the other brunch places around (Wild Eggs; Yolk; First Watch; Le Peep) there's no reason anyone should go to The Egg & I. [REVIEW_10] Brought my dog for treatment; I have to say it's the most unprofessional business I have ever been to. Extremely rude and obnoxious group of underachievers. They need a good lesson in manners and need to understand it's not about them it's about the animals in their care. If you care about your animals don't take them to Turkey Creek Animal Hospital for there all turkeys!",1
94,[REVIEW_1] The waitstaff were attentive and very nice! That is the only positive comment that I have for this establishment: I waited fir over an hour while moderate celebrities were ushered in. After all of the waiting the food was not good. Grits were hard and not seasoned; shrimp & fish over cooked; it was a disappointment. [REVIEW_2] This is 100% my favorite restaurant in the area! The food is great; the beer is good; and the waitstaff is incredibly friendly! My favorite beer is Fatback Amber but the titches wit is outstanding as well! Some of the other ones are sour (on purpose) and that's not quite my style but they are pretty popular.  I highly recommend this place! [REVIEW_3] Great food! Very impressed...I really like the brunch on the weekends. Chicken and waffles very good; avocado toast. [REVIEW_4] This place is a joke. Always had been. Nickel and Dime you. I worked here for 10 years and was let go after the flood for no reason other than we don't need you anymore. Employees are nothing more than a number. [REVIEW_5] The last 2 times we took our dog here; our female dog got kennel cough.  Added vet bills over $100.  Never going back to this place again. [REVIEW_6] OMG!  Seriously; some of these best cornbread I have ever had.  We discovered this family owned place during our last trip to the NO back in 2005.  It was so good we went back for 2 additional hits of their buttery cornbread.  It's crack I tellya; crack.  Why the hell else would I take a picture of it.   The fried seafood is really good too.  Go for lunch; if my memory is correct they have a different menu at lunch and I think they only serve their cornbread at lunch time. [REVIEW_7] I'm really glad I found this restaurant via Groupon. There was a bit of a wait because I didn't make a reservation; but the food was WELL worth the wait. It was delicious! I had the Cajun Pasta with Crawfish and Shrimp and Mango Ice Tea; Also ordered the Redfish with Mac n Cheese and Pontilly Potatoes to go-Delicious! The Redfish was seasoned to perfection! Customer Service was awesome as well! [REVIEW_8] A welcomed and long overdue addition to Bridesburg! Smokey Pint is truly one of a kind; and not just for the neighborhood; but the city. First; let's talk food. Specializing in BBQ; all the food is created by the Oink and Moo food truck team. SP is offering a solid selection of the trucks staples; from quesadillas; to sliders; tacos; mac & cheese; ribs; and more! And the brisket is to die for; a must try! Then comes the beer. You can choose from a selection of 6 rotating drafts; or 3 full fridges full of bottled and canned beer. Mix and match to create your own six pack; drink it in; or both. SP is a must go if you live in the neighborhood; and definitely worth the trip from the city! [REVIEW_9] Great mexican.  The grilled steak and chicken in the fajita and Vippy's special are family favorites! [REVIEW_10] Once again; I wish that I could give half stars; because this is really a 4.5 review.  Simply put; we were very happy with almost everything about this hotel.  Its location cannot be beat -- just across the street from the French Quarter proper; on a major bus line; and about  a 7-minute walk to the heart of Bourbon Street.  Our room faced Rampart Street and we never had a problem with street noise.  Right next door; there's a gas station with a convenience store with a pretty good deli -- got a great chicken po boy there.  Our two-bedroom suite was like our own apartment (with a small fridge but no kitchen); and everything worked properly; and the place was clean and in good repair.  You can access the HDMI ports of the HDTV if you want to plug in a device. The wi-fi worked well for us the whole time -- watched a few TV shows on Netflix without any problems.  There are two pools which are kept a very nice temperature.  The back pool seemed a bit sketchy; but the main pool in their lovely courtyard is an oasis.  The staff was uniformly friendly and helpful; going out of their way to get us things like towels; and Dennis even sent us a text message the night before we left offering to assist us with reserving a cab the next morning.  It was also a great value -- less than $150 a night for a two-bedroom suite; a figure that includes taxes and fees.  The only complaint was that the continental breakfast was exceedingly weak; with a very small number of oddly chosen foods -- the menu consisted of sliced tomatoes; sliced cheese; sliced oranges and sliced grapefruit;and bread but no pastries; no apples or bananas -- and drinks were limited to coffee; water; and Sunny Delight.  The do-it-yourself waffles were a nice touch.  But this was truly a minor complaint; as any visitor to New Orleans should never eat breakfast -- only brunch -- and never in a hotel when there are so many other great dining options.  Overall; we were incredibly happy with our decision to stay here; and it's now the first spot I'll consider on a return visit.  UPDATE on 7/9/2018:  I've stayed at the Suites three times since my original review; and I still love it.  Nothing at all has changed -- except for the sad fact that Dennis passed away suddenly a couple of years ago.  The new/remaining staff is totally competent; but Dennis' unique personality is missed.,7
95,"[REVIEW_1] Yum.  I love to swing by Smiley's on my way home from work and pick up a vegetarian falafel platter. Their falafel is perfection! Far; far better than Couch Tomato (no surprise there since this is a Mediterranean joint). Prices are fair; food is super fresh. Their hummus is silky with just a hint of lemon. Yes; carryout can take a little while but everything is made to order so I'm happy to wait or just call ahead. Do not miss this great little place!! [REVIEW_2] I would recommend Twisted Twig to everyone - excellent service; very friendly; and create amazing arrangements!  You will not regret working with Jen! I reached out to a few different florist 2 weeks before my wedding. I was frantic my wedding was only 2 weeks away and didn't have a florist; even though it was a small wedding. I got a hold of Jen; who I might say was very responsive.  I got on the phone with Jen and she was so nice and very genuine. We spoke about what I was looking for and I texted her some pictures of inspiration and my dress. She asked me if there were certain flowers I was looking for and my budget. I didn't have any flowers in mind; as long as the colors are what I wanted and told her my budget. She sent me a quote; staying within my budget; noting the flowers she would use for the bouquet; boutonniere; and floral arrangements for the arch I had. It was nice that Jen works with you to stay in your budget yet still get what you want.  On the wedding day; Jen arrived at my hotel door right on time with my beautiful bouquet. The floral arrangements at the site was gorgeous also. Jen really hit the mark on what I wanted for my wedding. She also was very sweet and added some roses on the chairs by the aisle to my surprise; which was not on the quote. That was very special because it pulled the whole ceremony look together and I felt Jen really wanted everything to look perfect for me. [REVIEW_3] What could be better than sitting outside with wine and cheese; listening to music? Get there early to get a seat...this place is slammed by 5! Great cheese and wine section. Hidden jem for the locals in the Bywater. Casual and relaxed. [REVIEW_4] Nothing bittersweet about this establishment! An absolute treasure in the warehouse district! The almond petit four and red velvet cheesecake were insanely delicious and I would go back every day if I could. I also had an iced almond milk latte and it beat the chain coffee places. The cakes looked wonderful and the staff was super friendly. Go Check It Out !!! You won't be disappointed! [REVIEW_5] Todd really takes the time to make sure he is doing what is right for your body. He is a great Chiropractor and has special student rates which I greatly appreciate. I highly recommend Peak Performance! [REVIEW_6] Awesome ""Fresh"" ingredients; good service; and a solid menu. Can't go wrong; it's a great addition to SoHo. [REVIEW_7] This is my favorite restaurant in Nashville! Incredible sushi and the hibachi is delicious. Make sure you ask for Chad! The guy is a legend in the making. His sauces alone make it worth the trip. I have been here over 10 times and have never had a bad experience. Don't miss out on this Nashville gem. [REVIEW_8] Super tasty; great service! The butter chicken had awesome spices and the naan was soft. The Tandoori chicken was delicious; too. [REVIEW_9] Delicious King Cakes (both the chocolate and the traditional)! [REVIEW_10] Home Wine Kitchen is hands down one of the best restaurants in St. Louis; and its ""No-Menu Monday"" is a must try!  After giving our sever some insight on our food preferences; my boyfriend and I were presented with dishes that were SPOT ON to our tastes.  The food was absolutely amazing; and the restaurant was super accomodating to my stricter-than-usual dietary preferences (vegan).  Actually; they gave me the best vegan meal I have had in STL to date; my boyfriend was also super satisfied with his meatier fare.  Thank you; Home Wine Kitchen; we will be back!  (Note:  Make sure to make a reservation!)",10
96,"[REVIEW_1] OMG the Buffalo tails must be made with Crack! !! I can't stop eating them!  Seriously;  with the light flour dusting these are perfect. Got with mild - super tasty and a side of hot for those more adventurous in our group. 50 tails for our family of 3 lasts about 3 days! [REVIEW_2] Love the Fried Chicken there but have you tried Joe Bob's Baby Back Ribs? We travel a lot and I have to say that after the Stake Out's rib in Las Vegas; these ribs are the second best we have eaten anywhere in Nevada. Super tender; juicy; and very meaty with a mild but great tasting sauce. Unlike some other's ribs; these have a nice smoked flavor even before the BBQ sauce is added.   Nice local pub atmosphere with a few slots and sports orientated TV's. Smoke free too. [REVIEW_3] absolutely my favorite sandwich place!  i LOVE LOVE LOVE Cosi's multigrain bread & LOVE LOVE LOVE their tomato basil soup! absolutely amazing :) i've been here several times & one time i got a free drink ! yayyy employer is very friendly & kind ! [REVIEW_4] Carne Seca burro was smokey; delicious and really filling. The price is great for what they give you. If only they automatically put some tomatoes and lettuce. :( Other than that; you have to stop by and try the carne seca burro; especially if you're just visiting the area. The tortilla is amazing - if I wasn't in the process of moving; I would have taken a few back home to eat. Don't forget to order an horchada - they serve one that is delicious! [REVIEW_5] TL;DR: View/ambience: excellent; Food - Good (not great - honestly; if you're considering this place for the food; just go to Vernick); Service - extremely poor (why you're reading this review)  I'm not the type of person who regularly writes yelp reviews - I like most places where I eat and don't feel the need to write about it. That being said; because our experience at R2L was so anomalous; I felt I had to warn people about the service.   While the food was good; and the view was wonderful; we had an unfortunate experience. At the beginning of our meal; the waitress was friendly and built a rapport with us. However; there was an unfortunate incident where someone (not our server) on the waitstaff knocked a glass of water on one of us and spilled our bottle of wine on the floor. No wine got on either of us; and we were very understanding - mistakes happen. We get it. Here's where problems arose.   What great service would have been: Provide a glass of wine promptly to make up for the amount spilled and comp something trivial; like a desert or app.   What reasonable service would have been: Provide a glass of wine promptly to make up for the amount spilled.   What actually; unfortunately; happened: The waitstaff gave us a bunch of napkins and apologized a couple of times. One of about three people hurriedly cleaning us up promised us 2 extra glasses to make up for the wine that had soaked into the carpet. Finally; the gentleman who made the mistake was very apologetic. Up until this point - totally fine.   Then; after a few minutes of everyone; including our formerly-friendly server; avoiding us like they heard there was a sudden outbreak of the Zika virus at our table; our server finally resurfaced to refill water. When one of us asked whether that wine was coming out (after all; someone we hadn't met before promised it then disappeared); rather than reassuring us; this was the response; verbatim: ""You didn't finish the bottle yet. We were going to bring it out when you finished the bottle."" Excuse me?   After the flippant response; our waitstaff's avoidant behavior continued. We finished our bottle of wine with dinner; then ordered a dessert (hey; maybe this would give them a chance to be reminded by the wine stain in the carpet that they promised to compensate us for our overpriced loss with a glass?).  Frustrated; we asked for the check. After our waitress ran our card; FINALLY; upon returning our check; she poured our two drinks; without speaking a word to us; as we were about to leave.   We expected better from a such a supposedly classy establishment. We cannot in good conscience recommend this restaurant to others. [REVIEW_6] So we walk in and the receptionist Vann was   absolutely incompetent at his job;  we simply asked if there was any vacancy to which he replied with out any computer or paperwork check ""NO""  so we walk out and do a online search and booked a room to that same hotel!  We Came back confronted him about it to which he replied ""he didn't know anything about it""   Well Van if you don't know the only thing you are being paid to do; I suggest a you find a new profession. [REVIEW_7] Wasn't that busy they might have had 4 servers on. Our server took forever to get us CANNED BEERS; we NEVER GOT OUR WATERS. Our appetizer came AFTER we finished our food. They comped it; but didn't try to make amends about the rest of horrible experience. We will NEVER GO BACK. [REVIEW_8] I've been here a handful of times and it's always because I don't have time to go to VN Nails near Costco where I prefer to go (they get 5 stars from me).  Kiwi Nail has always done a cheap job trying to take shortcuts wherever possible.  But today I've had it and will never go back!  After getting the typical shabby job on a fill with French tips;  I accidentally smudged two nails really badly.  They needed to be repainted and I asked her to do so... I even offered to pay extra.  The nail tech came over to look and she pressed the clumps back down and painted right back over the mess (didn't even keep the paint in the lines) then slathered so much varnish over the train wreck that it was literally dripping down my finger. After my nails were dry enough to leave;  another tech rang me up and the receipt had no place for a tip.  When I asked;  he told me I had to pay tips in cash... Well it's lucky for me I didn't have any cash.  He said I will have to tip her next time.  NEXT TIME??!!  yeah right!  There will be no next time! Save yourself the hassle and don't bother with this d@mn place! [REVIEW_9] Had a great time here. The food was fantastic; and the view was superb. The waitress seemed genuinely happy to be working here and was extremely friendly. No complaints. [REVIEW_10] Great place; and the food is incredible! Try the Verne's wings. So good! Patrons are friendly.  Staff are always very nice; with the exception of one bartender Bobby Q; wears bowling shirts all the time. Extremely rude if your not 50 or older if you catch my drift. If he's tending when you walk in go straight to the back for a table or head to Stadium bar down the street",6
97,[REVIEW_1] Paid for the $25 wash and detail (the most deluxe package they offer); added leather cleaning for $20. My dog had been in the car while muddy so there was dried dirt on the backseat; which I mentioned. I knew when they called me after only 15 min that it wasn't cleaned well. When I saw it it was obviously that they hadn't cleaned the leather at all. When I said that to the guy he sprayed a towel and literally wiped down the back seat for less than a minute. Didn't clean any other leather on the headrests; doors; console-anywhere. The wipe down on the cup holders; steering column; etc was just as bad. The vacuuming was terrible; didn't get under the mats or the way back. They didn't clean the rims at all even the the package included rim detail and shine. I basically paid $45 for a drive through car wash. [REVIEW_2] $5 for a good shoe shine. Two thumbs up for service and being the only place open on a Saturday in the summer. [REVIEW_3] Great place to hang out!  I saw 10 people that I knew in there at the same time this morning!   Check it out! [REVIEW_4] Horrible buffet; they don't have enough toppings.. you have to wait for the pizza.. not recommend it for one hr. Lunch.. [REVIEW_5] Called to make an appt and didn't make a reservation cause the person that answered the phone was zero help and acted like they didn't want to help me. [REVIEW_6] I am new to Philly; and heard about Lauren and her community acupuncture within a month of living here. I love it! Lauren is so attentive; energetic; and nurturing. I have come in for various reasons; and Lauren has been able to provide relief every time. She is also been very responsive to follow-up questions and concerns I send her via email.  I am very fond of the community aspect as well. The treatments are so affordable; and you get to be in a space with other people who are looking for healing and well-being also.  I feel lucky to have found Lauren and her space - a true sanctuary in the city. [REVIEW_7] Tried this place for breakfast and it was superb. The shrimp and grits was delicious and there was even enough to share; the sauce is made from scratch and probably the best shrimp and grits I've had. My son had the chocolate chip pancakes and he liked them so much he requested a second order. The French toast and regular pancakes were also very yummy and filling. The Bloody Mary's really hit the spot! Great place!! [REVIEW_8] After last night I will know this place as Cafe Ew for their bad service outside. I was excited to come to this place but the waitress was getting drink orders wrong; taking 30 minutes to get our drinks and eventually never came back. When it is so nice out this summer and you have such a nice patio; please get some good service outside. [REVIEW_9] OMG I am so excited! Every hibachi place in Tampa has like 2-3 stars and my hubby and I weren't excited to pay $100+ for a so-so meal. Then we found Kuchi...! We've been to this plaza a million times and have never seen this place; but it's brand spanking new!  The staff is so friendly...seriously..the hostess and waitress were all smiles; the chef was HILARIOUS and did all kinds of awesome hibachi chef things like shooting sake into our mouths; shooting zucchini into our mouths; the volcano; the peeing boy; the egg-roll.....lol (not every hibachi place does all these..and the shooting sake one is pretty rare)!  The sushi was delicious; the soup/salad were great; and we loved the steak/shrimp/chicken...even the owner came over to say hello and make a joke about how his hands are tired from massaging all the beef lol!!  Nothing negative to say...everything was wonderful and we will DEFINITELY be back! [REVIEW_10] Real Mexican food - rated highly by Craig LaBan recently in the Indie Chain restaurant category and well deserved. It all about the sauces and meat prep for me and this place deserves 5 stars for both. Try everything according to your ability to handle spice. The chicken mole enchiladas are my fave of faves. Simple tacos with onions and spiced meat are delicious. Simply put; if you have a hankering for Mexican; you will delighted at El Limon!!,6
98,"[REVIEW_1] I have currently been sitting in the same chair for 36 minutes waiting for a take out order that consists of one combination plate with hot braised chicken. I haven't ordered anything ridiculous or out of the ordinary; yet here I am. If I didn't already pay for the food or had any confidence in their ability to refund me; I would leave and go elsewhere. I haven't been assured that my food is coming soon; had anyone apologize to me for the wait; or even acknowledge my existence. It's now been 44 minutes since I first sat down and I am being nodded at. I guess that means my order is ready. I'll update this review when I actually get to eat the food. [REVIEW_2] I've been eating here when I'm in town for about 5 years and this place used to be great. The food has severely gone downhill in not only quality of ingredients but also in ability to prepare a dish. I ate here for lunch today; saying that so hopefully a member of the staff reads this and remembers me; I ordered the dry hot pot and my gf ordered fried dumplings and the cold noodles with chili oil and we shared each other's food. The mushrooms in my dish were impossible to cut even with a knife and the rest of the vegetables had a freeze dried feel to them being the consistency of bark. The pork was a bit rubbery and only had flavor from the oil draped over everything that seemed under seasoned as well and definitely tasted old. This was labeled in the menu as a 10/10 spicy rating; it was at most a 2. I didn't bother saying anything because of how rude the waiter/host was; but I'll get to that. The rice was cold and clumped together in chunks that led me to understand that it was previously microwaved. The dumplings looked ok; but the dough was undercooked and the sauce was just soy sauce that had no care whatsoever put into it. Her noodles were very bland and whoever prepared them obviously doesn't care about their food. The noodles had the same flavor deprived oil from my dish in it; just disappointing really. This type of food is supposed to be robust and I've eaten at a ton of places across the country and internationally that do care about what the put out. This place doesn't care anymore. The man that seated us was incredibly rude the entire time. He huffed and puffed and stomped his feet when I asked for the real Chinese menu instead of the Americanized Chinese menu. And; they used to throw shade if you asked for the Americanized menu; now it's the opposite. After we were done we both had a decent amount of food left and I decided to take it to feed to the raccoons that come around my house. They look cool and I like to feed them. Anyway; the take out container was dirty from previous food in it! I was blown away; especially when I pointed it out and the rude person pretending to be a man grabbed it out of my hand and stormed; literally stormed off before I was even half way through my sentence. I was calm the whole time; not sure what this guys deal is. Then came back with the same container that he washed! He washed the dirty container that should never have been used in the first place and thought that was acceptable. I will never go here again and I hope they go out of business so no one has to be punished by this Handy Nasty food. Disgusting food and disgusting people; except for the one guy who worked there who said goodbye to us. He seemed mortified because he knew what the cuck host just did to everyone in the dining area throughout the day and I assume throughout his life. I hate this place; and I can only hate it because I used to love it. [REVIEW_3] We were in St Pete on the weekend and decide to eat sushi. The worst sushi ever! Never go there again. All 3 or 4 king of sushi we ordered was terrible. [REVIEW_4] They had a wonderful doctor there that made dealing with their staff and scheduling issues worthwhile but she has since left and after a handful of appointments I am done with them.  There must be a better dermatology office in town.  They book out months; if not years in advance.  If you book the first appointment for the day they are still running at least 20 minutes late; the doctors and the staff show up almost a full half hour after they ""open"".  The staff tries to push cosmetic procedures on you and the one doctor I have seen is distracted and not paying attention.  During my yearly skin checkup last year I discussed my concern with bumps on my forehead that I could not get rid of and she told me I needed to use Retin-A type creams; but I had been using them and they clearly didn't work.  After researching on my own via internet I found I had a common fungal infection and washing my forehead with simple nizoral shampoo would clear it up; which it immediately did.  If you need a simple procedure done the doctor acts like it is no big deal to get you in but once you try to schedule it will be months before they see you.  Don't tell me to come in to get cystic acne treated with a cortisol shot if you are booking into next year.  After the misidentification/blow off of my forehead bumps I don't trust them for my basic yearly anymore.  I am so bummed the good doctor is gone; it is time to find another office. [REVIEW_5] Whatever you do avoid the asian lady (sorry i do not know her nationality) with grey salt n pepper hair AT ALL COSTS. Her work is substandard (ie i had to file my own nails to correct her shape; clean under my nails; adjust the stones on my nails). You show a design; she says okay then starts and tells you she doesnt have the materials. There was a void in my nail and she kept telling me it wasnt there and then proceeded to ""buff"" it out. I had to tell her twice to fix it. I paid im full; but will definitely watch my credit card statement for extra charges. My friend's nails came out great (she had one of the male nail techs). I can fix mine at home; I'll NEVER go back. Beware!!! [REVIEW_6] I had a Groupon for a Shellac manicure; Pedicure and Paraffin hand treatment. I didn't have too much of a problem getting an appointment over the phone though Brenda was very short with me.  Once I got there for my appointment with Brenda (which had been scheduled about 2 weeks in advanced) she was overbooked and asked me to come back later. I was unable to so she told me to come the next day. The next day I came back and was able to redeem my Groupon. It was a nice little shop but I did not see any sterilization of the nail tools. she carried them around in a coffee mug and there was nail dust everywhere;  She made personal calls during my pedicure and was very condescending when she spoke to me about my nails.  She also uses Bath and Body works lotion witch isn't a big deal but then she sprayed my legs with the body spray witch I thought was very strange and did not smell the greatest.  My shellac bubbled and didn't look the greatest and my nails were uneven. I also never got my Paraffin hand treatment because one of her ""usual"" customers came in and she was too busy talking to her to finish mine and I was very rushed at the very end.  She spent more time talking to others in the shop and on the phone than with me and was very condescending when she did speak to me. I will not be going there again and I will not be recommending this establishment to any of my peers. [REVIEW_7] Aw; man. I was hoping I'd previously posted a glowing review of RuSan's so I could prove that once upon a time; I liked it here. But; I didn't so just trust me on this one.  It is with a heavy heart that I relay today's experience over the lunch sushi buffet. Cold; gelatinous; and ~$11/each. It's been a year or three but I remember this being so much better. Don't get me wrong... I love cheap; fast food-ish; ethnic cuisine and I have lovely memories of the Ginger Simmered Beef; Fried Garlic and Bay Shrimp Salad Maki (like I said; once upon a time); but today? Lackluster is an overstatement.  With each bite; I kept hoping the next would be better. But; alas. It wasn't.   Why; RuSan's? With all your new neighboring restauranteurs in The Gulch; is this the taste of complacency? I shake my head in disappointment because I know your potential and cherish what we once had.   On the upside; my water was refreshing and the service was fine. [REVIEW_8] I have been to this location once before with no issues. Last time I got my soon a bubble tea. The pearls (tapicoa bubbles) seemed to make him sick. I hope this place does a better job at assuring the drinks/food is fresh. [REVIEW_9] My fiancé and I stayed at this hotel for 3 days and 4 nights for the Epicor convention. Stunning view is an understatement. Every square inch is covered in indoor lush tropical gardens; rivers; ponds with koi; and several waterfalls. Being the incredible size it is; you must carry a map or stop at their map stations to figure out where you are. Every where you turn; is an incredible photo opportunity. This a place of intriguing explorations of multilevel curiosities. It takes a small village to keep this resort running. Truly the Disney world for adults. Staff is trained to smile and offer warm hellos as you walk by; offer professional prompt service; and jump to their feet if you say ""boo"". I don't know how the staff does it. I wouldn't be able to do it. I don't know able you; but I don't clean toilets with a peppy smile. Perhaps supergluing their faces with a permanent smile and a secret record button they press when you walk by. There are many many different bars and restaurants to choose from. Anywhere from fun casual to trendy to fine dining. The banquet food offered everyday was a hit or miss. The quality was there; especially for banquet food; but it mostly depended on your personal taste preference. We visited 2 restaurants and even room service. Each was very good and service was on par. Downside is that everything is extremely expensive. A dollar store type of cheap tre semme travel pump hairspray was almost $7. So don't forget your hairspray or deodorant people. I was already expecting inflated prices in the stores and bar because of the location; however; we almost peed our pants when we got our drink bill. $67 for 4 cheap bicardi and cokes. I'm scared what the bill would have been had we ordered a high end liquor. So back to the convention for the free drinks we went. I visited the spa. 20% gratuity was included in the bill. Which is ok. I would have tipped 18-20% anyways. The anti aging facial was more expensive than most spas; but I'd have to admit; it was worth it even tho I broke out in some kind of rash under my lower lip. I swear I'm not allergic to any products I've used before! Oh well. Nobody's fault. I would still go back. My skin felt radiant afterwards.   The downside is that the resort is nowhere near downtown Nashville. The entire inside of the resort is a giant greenhouse for their incredible species of plants. So expect it to be very warm and humid. Expect to dish out a lot of money on food and drinks. I was not able to stay over the weekend; but I would have liked to seen a bit more entertainment walking the miles and miles of tropical paths. It would truly be comparable to a Disney resort; with no reason to leave; for adults if they had some kind of entertainers. They definitely have the room and atmosphere to accommodate some nightly entertainment. Perhaps some live music in one of their wonderful gazebos? Actors in costume greeting guests?   So after my ridiculous blabbing; I would say that the staff is unbelievably amazing; there is no reason to leave the resort if you are staying only a few days (unless you are seeking entertainment) I don't recommend this for children. They would definitely be bored. [REVIEW_10] Poor service to start off with. Server was abrupt and seemed to be kind of snippy I guess you could say. Waited 25 minutes for food and when it arrived it was luke warm at best. Something we had never seen before but they would not let a couple pay individually. There were 3 couples in our party. Safe to say we will not be going back.",1
99,"[REVIEW_1] If I could give it a zero; I would. I order a plain hamburger; and realized they put  bacon in it (which I am allergic to and unable to eat) after two bites. When I went back to the drive-through window to complain (didn't realize the actual restaurant was open--it was almost 2 after all...); the guy took back the burger; said nothing; and disappeared. After 2 minutes of awkwardly making conversation with the next people in line in their car; he came back and rudely told me I had to go inside to get my food. Which I did. And still did not get an apology.  I refuse to go back there after that ordeal; which is a shame; because it's nice to have a variety of places to go to after DT. Guess Freebirds it is! [REVIEW_2] Zero stars for the Chicken Teriyaki Lunch Bento Box.  I have literally never seen a bento box come without rice before.    Disappoint. [REVIEW_3] One of (if not) the best pizza places around. The chicken bacon rancher pizza is the best and beats any other kind of place that sells it. Boneless wings are also pretty good. [REVIEW_4] we haven't even stayed here yet; and this establishment has already created a bad impression!  our family booked a 3 night weekend over the 4th of july via hotwire and i called the reservations desk to confirm.  the hyatt person was supremely snotty (thanks; susan) and kept interrupting me to say ""is there anything else i can help you with?!"" in order to imply that i was bothering her.    our requests were simple: 2 beds (we're bringing our twins) and to make a note of our late check-in.  ""and will that be ALL?"" the reservations person asked.  because this is a special visit for our girls; i asked if it would be possible to have a room facing the arch.  to which she LAUGHED and then replied ""no.  you'll need to pay extra for that.""  we expect to be treated with basic courtesy when patronizing any business.  needless to say; we are NOT looking forward to our stay here this weekend. [REVIEW_5] Pretty good Beef Quesadilla; my girlfriends frozen margarita was pretty good; a little pricey for what you get. Our waiter reminded us of Brian from Half Baked; service was prompt and friendly. Most likely to return. [REVIEW_6] Loved this place; especially the Salmon. Only eaten here at Lunch and not a problem. Going to add this one to my Lunch rotation. Spotless restrooms and the service is top notch. [REVIEW_7] How this place gets so many stars I just don't know.  Devil's food cake with cheap icing and chocolate shavings does not make a great cake.  If you are in a pinch for a good cake go to the Whole Foods at 20th & Callowhill and they can generally letter up a birthday cake for you with a quickness. [REVIEW_8] First time buyer and immediately impressed with the level of professionalism and customer service from David. I bought 3 bottles of wine to be shipped to a friend and provided the wrong address. After the shipment was delivered; David went out of his way to make things right and shipped to the correct address for me. I am now a Redneck Wine fan! :) [REVIEW_9] We have been to so many different bbq places but this absolutely amazing the place is so colorful and laid back tried the beef brisket and smoked sausage and enjoyed it to the last bite.  Next time we are in the mood for BBQ we know where we are going ! [REVIEW_10] Excellent food atmosphere and service . Everything was fresh and hot when we were served ;and the dessert tray is absolutely amazing!  We walked here from our hotel ( Hotel Monaco) and are so glad we did! Bon Appetito!!",6
