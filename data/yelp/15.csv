0,"[REVIEW_1] I really; truly hate giving bad reviews but I can't help it this time. Before I check a place out I refer to Yelp and boy did I get an eyeful when I read about the BROKEN BEAKER DISTILLERY. Vodka tasting like dirt? I wanted to give it a chance anyway. I never knew there was Dirt Flavored Vodka; but they sell it and it's expensive!! You can drink while the TV is turned down so you can't hear it; while there is no music on and while they ignore you and talk amongst themselves behind the bar. Rude!! The glasses/beakers that the drinks were served in were neat; but there was barely anything in there to drink at all; and for nearly $10!!! Don't get me started on the food and how when your ordering they make you think the side comes with it by asking; ""What's your side?"" only to be given your bill to see that sides are extra. The sandwich was just like one you could've made at home. Not even worth a description. I really hate it but 1 star is all I can give. I hope they make it big with Dirt Flavored Vodka. [REVIEW_2] I once went to this Gavi and it was fine.  Second time though it was mostly empty; sat down; waited 15 minutes without service and left.  Haven't been going back and have been telling everyone I know not to go there. [REVIEW_3] Only came here since it was featured in US Weekly magazine as one of Taylor Swift's favorite places. This place was terrible. We ordered the pulled pork platter with a side of mac n cheese and slaw and the half ribs platter with a side of potato salad. Our order was wrong; the food was burned; the slaw had way too much vinegar; and the ribs were rock hard. I don't recommend this place at all. [REVIEW_4] Coming from a person who's whole family is from the bayous of Louisiana it's ok. The roux on the gumbo is a little to thick. Gumbo over jambalaya is almost insulting. Po boy wasn't a po boy it was more like a Hoagie with Cole slaw a semi blackened chicken. The flavor is kinda close (if you are a rookie to this food). If you have never had REAL creole/Cajun food you'll love it. I am of creole descent and I grew up on this food ;but like I said if you go to Louisiana (especially bayous were it started not new Orleans) you'll know what I'm talking about. For rookie creole/Cajun palates it's descent though. [REVIEW_5] The diner was extremely busy and the waitresses were being pushed to their limits.  The problem was the kitchen; obviously; when the food came it was dry and overdone; the sides came later; the desert was not cooked(rice pudding).  The waitress did offer another choice and we will see how that is later as after being there over 1 hr we brought home.  The owners or managers only seem to care if a substitute was made and who was your server but not that the kitchen staff is being overworked with this crowd and cannot be attentive to their cooking when being pushed like this.  The first manager pushed me to second manager and they really don't seem to care as long as they can push the crowd to fill the tables.  A few waitresses heard my complaints and thanked me as they said they have been trying to tell them this too.  Well; that is my last visit here as I would rather go up the street to a smaller diner (Club Diner) and get a better meal and more attentive staff. [REVIEW_6] This is the WORST!  OVER PRICED!  3 Little scallops (COLD!!! and cut in half!!!---they were about 1/4 inch thick!) for $10!  The other apps I got were rediculously over priced!!!  The Bartender was Very Nice!  I got take out.  I got home and almost cried! After eating $30 worth of food; I was STILL HUNGRY!!!!  NEVER AGAIN!!!!! [REVIEW_7] Stayed here the day of our wedding. The first room smelled like cigarettes. The second room smelled like chlorine. Mind you I don't have a good sense of smell either. [REVIEW_8] Went here based on the high ratings and raves from people.  The entire experience was underwhelming from start to finish.  Their website which is fairly useless if you want to figure out the menu before going; you have to pick your location choice out of 3 locations and then drill down to the bottom to see the weak descriptions of their menu offering; no explanations and no price; just this      Roast Beef     Roast Beef Combo     Roast Pork     Roast Pork Combo     Baked Ham     Baked Ham Combo     Roast Turkey     Roast Turkey Combo     Broccoli Rabe     Broccoli Rabe Combo   No explanation of whats in a combo (its just where they add cheese by the way)  The table placecard (instead of menu) had a more detailed description than the website.    When I walked in; its more bar than restaurant; no big deal; but there were tables.  Since I couldnt decide and the sandwiches werent too expensive at $6.85; I got the roast beef and roast port combos.  I got my two sandwiches fast enough; but the roast beef was cold and the roast pork was hot.  Not sure how a cook (for lack of a better word) could serve 2 things at the same time with such a temperature differential; one was obviously sitting for awhile.  I asked the waitress to reheat the roast beef while I finished the roast pork; and supposedly it was reheated; since it was warmer; but it was still cold-ish compared to my roast pork I had just finished.  The waitress did offer to replace it when she inquired; but I was in a hurry and didnt really care for a hot version of this sandwich.  The sandwiches were very skimpy on meat; but they ""made up for it"" by adding too much gravy to make it overly messy and the bread was disintegrating.  The menu place card mentions the ""wet meat"" option where you get less gravy; I strongly recommend you get it that style; especially if the gravy overpower the meat and structural integrity of the sandwich. [REVIEW_9] So I'm quite certain I will never be returning to this restaurant. Upon walking in the manager greets us and asks where we were from. A friend of mine; and the only one amongst us from Louisiana; responded. The manager came back with a comment about my friend being from a trailer park when he heard where he was from (he's never lived in a trailer). So immediately not a good impression.  We get seated; the manager tells us our server is going to be male; a female shows up. Clearly bad communication. The waitress greets us and asks how we're doing and I return the question. She responds that she has been better. I'm a server and I know from experience; even if you're having a bad day; you don't show it or just come right out and say it.  The waitress suggests homemade hurricanes to drink. Two of the people in my party decide to try one. They were horrible. They were so potent u could hardly drink them. They definitely needed to add a little juice. Some cornbread with a honey sauce came to the table. It was very good! As an appetizer; the 4 of us split a sampler platter.... Which took 25 minutes to hit the table. The shrimp were good. The catfish was plain. The salmon patties were just OK. The red beans were pretty good. The turnip greens were very bitter. Overall not impressed.  For our entrees: One friend got the rib eye; it was undercooked. His wife got a blackened fish. The only reason the fish was ""blackened"" was because it was burnt. My fianc√© got the jambalaya and catfish plate. The jambalaya was decent but the catfish was again plain. I had the shrimp scampi. It was pretty much the only positive thing about the whole meal besides the cornbread. Oh and did I mention it took 45 minutes after we finished our appetizer for the entrees to get there... [REVIEW_10] Probably the worst haircut experience I've ever had. Trimmed my beard against my request and it came out very uneven. Took FOREVER. Workers were extremely inconsiderate. Definitely do not go here. [REVIEW_11] Yikes; I just got that hard nasty piece of chicken that usually ruins Chinese restaurants for you. Bad; very bad. The worst. The steak and shake next door was so busy they had to close; and I should have known since no one was in line at Wendy's. most disgusting fast food I've ever experienced; crazy that this was the absolute worst. Garbage food. [REVIEW_12] If I could give it a zero; I would. I order a plain hamburger; and realized they put  bacon in it (which I am allergic to and unable to eat) after two bites. When I went back to the drive-through window to complain (didn't realize the actual restaurant was open--it was almost 2 after all...); the guy took back the burger; said nothing; and disappeared. After 2 minutes of awkwardly making conversation with the next people in line in their car; he came back and rudely told me I had to go inside to get my food. Which I did. And still did not get an apology.  I refuse to go back there after that ordeal; which is a shame; because it's nice to have a variety of places to go to after DT. Guess Freebirds it is! [REVIEW_13] Someone is ""salting"" this place ... what I mean is; if you are giving this joint even the sightest positive nod you are either a family member of the owner or you have been living in the Sudan for the last ten years (no offense to the Sudanese but if you have been there.. ) This restaurant was good years ago .. NOW = Old food that does not get replentished unless you beg (where the F is the board of health?) My wife goes for the Crab Legs (ALL YOU CAN EAT MY EYE) .. they actually have the nerve to post a hand written sign taped over the very small cab leg pan that reads ""please take only 3 or 4 legs ..be considerate to others"" What it should read is  ""Please take only 3 or 4 crab legs because we want to capture more of your money by not having to repentish the crab legs"" .... the propieters are very nice; but their actions are not appropriate .. Perhaps they should just close down and do something else .. or do something right. [REVIEW_14] Because when I say I want a non smoking room;it doesn't mean put me a a smoking floor in an enclosed hotel in a non smoking room. I don't want to smell that shit EVERYTIME I walk out my door. Won't be back. Thats why I called at 3:00 to make a resi so I could get a good room. But he wouldn't make me a reservation. [REVIEW_15] Please do not go to this place. The food is just horrible. I thought of giving this place a second chance; and I was disappointed again. Not that Sitar and New Delhi are great; but they are much much better than Tandoor. Please do not torture your taste buds by going to this place.",0
1,"[REVIEW_1] My husband ordered 2 boxes of pizza and garlic bread twist w/ extra garlic sauce on the side at 10:30pm. By 11:30pm we were still waiting on the food to arrive. My husband decided to call to get an ETA and he was told 25 mins....by the general manager. It is 12am and we just received the food! Upon arrival the food was dry; no longer hot and did not have the extra sauce we paid for! If you are looking for good food this is NOT the place! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! [REVIEW_2] We've been hearing of a new menu in the works for months since the much-ballyhooed original chef who developed the current one apparently didn't work out. The current kitchen staff executes the current menu rather badly. Chipotle shrimp tacos were bland and missing ingredients promised on the menu. At breakfast at least the waiter (one he showed up at breakfast) was honest in admitting that the salmon was no longer house-smoked as the menu says. Respect your customers enough not to lie to them on an easily corrected paper menu. Corned beef hash was more like chili; swimming in a sea of greasy broth in a bowl. Will give it one more strike if they get around to a new menu before improving. [REVIEW_3] Wow!  I just wrote a scathing review about El Patron Pizza in Tampa for leaving unwanted and unwelcome fliers under the door of unsuspecting tourist here in Tampa.  I was going to use a lot of the same issues for this review of New York Pizza Grill; but now I'm not sure what to say; only to say it carefully.  I knew there was something not quite right about the greasy looking punk that was meandering in the hallway of the 4 star hotel where I am currently residing.  As soon as I saw the flier I grabbed my room key and went looking for this person.  In hindsight that was not smart; as soon as I got a look at the guy; I ran for the elevator.  Now; I am no shrinking violet; but this guy looked like he's slap his own mother.  After reading the other reviews on here; I guess I should be happy that this employee didn't turn around and attack!  My biggest issue with this business is that they litter the halls and rooms with these fliers.  They sneak into hotels; a place where you feel safe and after this; I don't.  It doesn't seem to matter where it is a 5 star hotel chain or a family run business.  I did call every one of the pizza place that do this; because I felt bad about complaining to the staff at the hotel; but after yesterdays run in with greasy guy for New York Pizza Grill; I had it.  I do not feel safe and I told management that; and the did call the police.  So; for the employee of New York Pizza Grill; if you get caught stuffing fliers under doors where you are not invited and do not belong; you are more than likely going to be arrested.  So when you are out and about making not enough to keep your car running; ask yourself if your boss will bail you out of jail.  I doubt it; they'll probably just get another less than intelligent person to litter; trespass; annoy and sometimes terrify; hotel staff and their guests.  There are numerous reasons not to eat at New York Pizza Grill; but I'm just tossing out a good reason not to work for them. [REVIEW_4] Someone needs to find out who's in charge of greeting diners as they walk in to this place. I stood for almost 10 minutes as 2 employees failed to show me to a table. The first employee to see me hardly even glanced at me; let alone attempt to greet me. He was seating 2 ladies just as I walked in so I assumed he would be right back to seat me. Bad assumption. Luckily; there was a second employee serving a table nearby who asked if I had been taken care of yet. When I told her I had not; she disappeared for a minute; only to return to reassure me that it would only be a couple of minutes longer for me to wait to be seated; presumably not by her since she was roaming around in plain sight the whole time. 5 or more minutes of standing alone in the entrance way later; I walk up to the outdoor seating area and find the first employee opening a bottle of wine at a table. After seeing him glance at me out of the corner of his eye; and still not even making eye contact or asking me what he could do for me; I stand and stare for a minute while he works; only to find that second reassuring employee finally peek through and open the door. She proceeds to ask me IF I would like to be seated. Now from where I'm standing it should have been abundantly obvious that I was waiting to be seated; but rather than admit an error on their part; she would have me believe she wasn't sure. Now I don't believe either of them meant any malice towards me; but first of all the assumption should be that someone standing with their arms crossed in the entrance should be waiting to be seated; unless they've said otherwise; and in any case shouldn't they be asked? If there were a host stationed at that entrance this could have been avoided; but as it went; no one knew that I wasn't being served and no one did enough to try and find that out. ~feeling let down. [REVIEW_5] The food ranks 3 stars but the service ranks only 1/2 star; dragging the over-all star rating down to a sub-zero number.   I walked up to the counter; was looked at (though not acknowledged) and; after a span of time what seemed eternal; asked by a gal standing far back from the counter; ""Do you need something?""   ""Food!"" I answered. Yep. Food.   She continued on with what she was doing: the grueling task of flipping tortillas on a grill. I full expected the woman's head to twist a complete 360 degrees; a trick I once saw in the movie ""The Exorcist"". If I had been wearing a cross around my neck I think she no doubt would have begun to manifest; as her eyes were by this time rolling in their sockets and back into her head.  I promise not to bother you again.... [REVIEW_6] We wanted salad for lunch so decided to try this place. The older gentleman given the task of making our salads was a complete jerk. After being rushed to give him my toppings order several times; he told me he had other things to do. I responded that we could always go eat elsewhere if that was the case. He shrugged to let us know he didn't care; so out the door we went. Don't go in there if you're new to the establishment and don't know exactly what you want! [REVIEW_7] Karaoke is wonderful!!!!! They need more women's restrooms. One stall is not enough to have the traffic they have. It's quite ridiculous!!! Have respect for the customers you serve!! Close your doors if you can't renovate! [REVIEW_8] Won't go back. Service was great; but the food was awful. All 6 in our party were disappointed. both Chicken parm entrees were very salty and greasy. Chicken sandwich had soggy bun. Fish and chips were soggy as well. Bistro burger was dry.   Would be great to drink beer and watch the game. [REVIEW_9] Place is such a RIP OFF! Their mechanics are terrible at their jobs and they don't even do it correctly. Your better off going somewhere else instead of this place. [REVIEW_10] I first want to start off with the fact of how much I love Blaze Pizza. I've been here mmmmm about ten times. Well not this exact location; but nevertheless to Blaze Pizza. Tonight's occasion was Friday pizza night with the kids. What made it even more fantastic was the buy one get one free coupon I retrieved from Facebook. I ended up seeing a friend here who also had the coupon. Before I ordered our food I made sure to ask the cashier; Amanda; if it was buy one get one free for all pizzas or per order. She stated for all pizzas. I went ahead and ordered and added my friends order to ours; just to be nice. Once it was time to check out; the same cashier then said no; you can only have one per order. I purposely ordered four pizzas based one what she told me. I was of course puzzled and frustrated. She then turned to who she called the ""general manager"" and said I can only do one right and he said yes without even looking into what was going on. I tried to get his attention but he ignored me. He was a little busy I will add but when something is happening; tend to it. I told her ma'am I only did it this way because of what you told me but of course she acted oblivious. Totally upset me but I decided to just leave with the bill we were given. I was really upset not because of what happened but because of how it was handled. Rudely and unprofessional! [REVIEW_11] Went here based on the high ratings and raves from people.  The entire experience was underwhelming from start to finish.  Their website which is fairly useless if you want to figure out the menu before going; you have to pick your location choice out of 3 locations and then drill down to the bottom to see the weak descriptions of their menu offering; no explanations and no price; just this      Roast Beef     Roast Beef Combo     Roast Pork     Roast Pork Combo     Baked Ham     Baked Ham Combo     Roast Turkey     Roast Turkey Combo     Broccoli Rabe     Broccoli Rabe Combo   No explanation of whats in a combo (its just where they add cheese by the way)  The table placecard (instead of menu) had a more detailed description than the website.

[REVIEW_12] I concur with all the other 5 star reviews!  I'm always skeptical as to reviews really be honest these days; especially in this case since mostly all of them are 5 stars; but it's ALL true!!  This boutique is very nice and clean; and Lori did an excellent job with the waxing and making me feel comfortable.  This was my first time getting the blue hard wax; and I'm sold!  I don't ever need to go back to the regular wax again!  Another plus is the option of a ""custom wax"".  I left there very pleased; and already made my appt. to go back!  Soooo grateful to Yelp reviewers in helping me find this spot! [REVIEW_13] Very disappointed :( We came first thing in the morning; but we're rushed through because a group had appointments an HOUR later. The girl didn't clean out my toes; skipped my cuticles; and proceeded to BURN me with her callous sander. For four days I've been walking around with sander induced Blisters and they hurt like heck! She put two coats on my big toe and one on the other toes. The decor is nice; but the staff is unprofessional and need to be trained how to do nails without rushing. You won't get return customers with this level of service. [REVIEW_14] This place is absolutely amazing. A cute little bakery and the employees are super attentive. I walked in and was bouncing around from one dessert to another deciding if I should make a purchase. The employee offered me a sample of the banana puddings - definitely try some! And you know how sometimes when they give you so small of a sample to taste; you can't really make a proper judgment because there isn't enough to judge from? Not the case here!  I got the salted caramel banana; the strawberry banana pudding and the upside pineapple cake.  Thoughts: OMG!! I never crave banana pudding and never really thought anything of the dessert. But man after this; I wanted to go home and make my own banana pudding (Although I highly doubt that I could make it half as good)! Their desserts are crafted perfect - three/four layers depending on what you get. The bottom layer the the pudding; second layer is the nilla wafers or they might even use some sort of pound cake(whatever it was - it was AMAZING); third layer; the strawberry and then the top layer is pudding with a nice whipped creme and topping. The creme has so much flavor and the texture is so smooth. Everything just comes together so nicely!   The upside pineapple cake was BOMB. the cake wasn't too fluffy but was dense to the perfect amount to Taste like what it's suppose to. The pineapple flavor isn't overwhelming but just right. My only problem was that the pineapple bottom got a little too carameliZed with brown sugar and was a bit hard to chew.  Definitely go to this place! I was so sad that there was no option to leave them a tip. (They use an iPad to ring you up). The service/help was so great and I would have left a tip but I had no cash. Any ways; highly recommend this place for desserts!! [REVIEW_15] My first time coming here was super awesome. So I decide to bring my Mom for my second visit. Unfortunately I was so disappointed and mad that I took my mom here for lunch. We waited for about an hour for our food and they even manage to messed it up.  Might come back for the drinks but not for the food.",2
2,"[REVIEW_1] The Best icecream on this side of heaven. I love this place the icecream here is soo flavorFULL whew! New Orleans has the best of the best even when it comes to ICECREAM :) one u come here for icecream you'll forget about baskin robins and cold stone sorry not sorry lol ENJOY [REVIEW_2] Hands down favorite sub place around. The atmosphere is fun with the fire fighter theme- they totally roll with It from the table decor to the names of the subs. Who doesn't love a hot sub!? They are by far more unique than subway or jimmy johns or any other sub place. They don't have many bread options but the toppings and wide selection of hot sauces makes up for that- talk about flavor! I love the sub machine with the over 120 drink options but with only one machine it takes forever to get your drink.... But at least you can make it special! Every time I go here it's packed! The customer service is great; I love that they walk your meal to you; it's better than standing around or having a pager. They also do boxed lunches or catering which is always a great addition to any party. [REVIEW_3] One of my favorite places to eat!  The food is amazing and creative.  Even my meat-loving husband enjoys the food.  I have never had a bad meal here.  My favorites are the nachos and Blue LT. [REVIEW_4] Wow! What a cool place to hang out and enjoy a delicious lunch. You can't really tell from the outside how cool this place is but once you walk in the front door and see the huge counter with the menu in great view a top it's easy to order; pay and then go out to the picnic like area outside and wait till your buzzer calls you to pick up your tray. The tables are far enough away from each other that you really feel like you are enjoying an outdoor picnic. The hamburger I had was yummy. I was there for a meeting with 4 other people and everyone raved about the lunch choices. We could hear each other very well during our meeting and everyone had only good things to say about this place. The prices were reasonable; the staff came by a couple times to pick up trash. It was all good. I highly recommend it. Oh...there is indoor seating; in case you wondered. [REVIEW_5] This place is absolutely amazing! The owners are very friendly & service is fast & excellent! you'll definitely feel at home in this place. The food is always fresh and seasoned JUST TO PERFECTION. The only place I will eat Middle Eastern food from! [REVIEW_6] This place was soooo good. I went for breakfast because my sister who lives here did it's the best place to go for breakfast. I ordered the country Benedict and it was awesome! I also had a pancake and that was delicious. I love brunch and breakfast food so this place hit the spot for sure!   It's a little loud cause it's very open and has a cement floor so it echos a bit.   Food is great; service was great no complaints! [REVIEW_7] This is my first time having Snarf's and I have to say it won't be the last. The gluten free bread was amazing and the prime rib was perfectly rare! [REVIEW_8] Great quesodilla with very tender steak and the Chipotle sauce was great.  Serving was big enough for two.  Atmosphere was fun and the service was great. They have good music and I think because they are new they were not terribly crowded. [REVIEW_9] I think I might even like this Tria a smidge better than the Rittenhouse location; after sitting in the litlte upstairs section which had much more breathing space than the smaller 19th St spot. The waitress we had was as good as ones we've had in previous locations: super cheerful; adorable; and prompt at checking on drinks and clearing away the plates.  We went today to check out Pliny the Younger; and while the ensuing scene was a little chaotic (maybe drink tickets would have been easier?) with two lines on either side of the store; they did the best they could; letting in 10 people at a time until the restaurant was filled. We were worried about our friend; who was running late and doesn't like beer; not being allowed in; but she had no problems after letting the host know we were waiting for her.  The food was also delicious. We all shared the Asturian Blue cheese which was nicely complimented by a blackberry sauce; I had the wild mushroom sandwich which had a lovely lemony flavor; my boyfriend had the three cheese sandwich (which I have ordered before and is quite good); and our friend had the truffled egg toast; which we have also tried before and is one of the standout starter items.  All in all; I have yet to be disappointed by an experience at a Tria in either location; even with these crazy extenuating circumstances! [REVIEW_10] Sushi for 2-- really more like sushi for 3. Great service; incredibly fresh fish; comfortable environment. [REVIEW_11] It pains me to rate anyone a single star; but I really was disappointed with my meal at Market Grill last night and won't be back.    We; a three-some; went on the recommendation of an acquaintance.  First impression walking in the door; smoke-free (yay!) and beautiful original brickwork; but a really scrubbed-clean feeling.  Which is good; or could be.  Maybe it just felt out of place in Soulard :).    From there it was all downhill.  The menus we were given were dog-eared; ripped; with pen marks and spots of indeterminable provenance.  Poor impression.  Print some new menus.    We were not offered a drink list.  When I asked for the drink list; the server said; ""We don't have a drink list; but I can get you a wine menu.""  But there is a neon Bud Light sign in the window.  If you don't have a list printed; use your voice and tell me what you offer.  A note on the wine menu: sorted into reds and whites.  Fair enough.  Beneath the reds?  The whites.  And beneath the whites?  The reds.  Print some new menus.  And considering the venue; their wine pricing is high.  The server made no effort to sell us drinks.    The food.  The first thing the server told us was that they were out of the soup of the day.  Ok; fine; benefit of the doubt; it must have been excellent and super-popular; right?  We started with hummus - not my choice.  Did not meet expectations.  I ordered meatloaf.  It was surprisingly dense and rather dry - full of filler.  The mashed potatoes looked more like mashed hash browns; I don't quite know how to describe them.  The green beans had to have come from a freezer bag.  And the fried onion & jalapeno straws were completely out of place on the plate.  I probably left half of my food behind; I could have done better at home.    One of my friends ordered a wrap he seemed to enjoy; the other ordered the special - they serve prime rib Saturday evenings.  She found it under-done but it looked right to me.  For some reason we thought we might need an order of the mac and cheese.  Friends; if your mother ever made you mac and cheese; this will be a disappointment.    My glass of wine was empty for; I don't know; a good half an hour.  The server never noticed.    The facilities in the handicap bathroom I realize must have been built to code but anyone paying attention will notice that the soap dispenser; mirror; and towel dispenser are unsuitably high for someone sitting in a wheelchair.    I wish Market Grill all the best; someone has put a lot of love into the building and is trying to make it as an entrepreneur; and I appreciate that.  But they need some serious focus and refinement on the menu concept and design and a reboot on the service. [REVIEW_12] I came in about a month ago because I was a new Verizon customer having trouble activating my new Galaxy S7 Edge. 3 of the male employees made an awesome group effort to figure out the issue (turns out my old phone company was taking forever to release my phone # for porting over to VZW). They took their time; making several phone calls until they figured out the problem. One of them installed a Zagg screen protector for me and another even pointed out that I qualified for a FREE TV with my phone purchase! I wish I could remember their names (I think one was Mario?); but hopefully they know who they are and that their customer service is appreciated! [REVIEW_13] This place honestly was a disappointment! Very thin cuts of meat for the price compared to other places. The food came out cold too. Had the Dolsot Bibimbap and the stone pot was cold to the point I could've picked it up and not get burned.   When you order a dolsot bibimbap of any kind; the rice at the bottle should be able to get crunchy....nope not here.   LADIES AND GENTLEMEN; please save your money and go somewhere else. [REVIEW_14] I have used Wurster's for a couple of repairs to my wife's BMW.  Each repair was over 30% less than the dealership quote.  The facility is not plush; but you keep the savings from their low overhead.  They seem very honest about what your car needs. [REVIEW_15] Delicious! Everything from start to finish. Loved the ceviche; the enchiladas and finally the flan. Amazing!",13
3,"[REVIEW_1] Darin and Sierra were fantastic to work with. They were very flexible when some plans & routes needed to change; even less than a week before the actual event. The driver was warm & so courteous; and helped a few of our older guests beautifully. All of our guests were charmed by the schoolbus; and enjoyed the partylights on the way home. Many also loved that the sign on the side was changed from ""Jessica & Shannon are getting hitched"" on the way up; to ""Jessica & Shannon are hitched!"" after the ceremony. I loved working with JOTSB and would highly recommend them. [REVIEW_2] Great setting. Food & service did not match the hip bar/restaurant. My friends and I (6 people) had a reservation for brunch on Sunday. We were the only table there and the bar was less than full. It took a very long time to get our drinks. Our server was not attentive. We weren't going to get our bottomless mimosas waiting around for her bc she was sitting & rolling silverware chatting it up with her co-worker. So I took our glasses directly to the  bartender for our refills instead. Food was mediocre at best. I ordered the hot chicken tacos which wasn't spicy at all. My friends ordered the lox; it was fishy and it was more like smoked salmon flakes; no actual slices of smoked salmon. Pricey for what it was. The steak my friend ordered was very salty. A very bad representation of Nashville eateries. I do not recommend going here. [REVIEW_3] My wife purchased a 90 min massage from Groupon as I was having major shoulder pain. This was the first time ever having a professional massage and I was happy to get this done here at Liferoot. Nate was able to relieve the pain in my shoulder and I am now back to my regular workout routine. [REVIEW_4] I went here today with some friends and have to say it was amazing! The food here is phenomenal! We got three different apps (man cave wings; pretzels; and blue chips) and all were outstanding. For entree; I ordered the meatball sandwich and it was very moist and had a southern twist with bbq sauce and slaw. Definitely order the tater tots!! They are the best I have ever had. Great atmosphere; tons of TVs; and great staff. Highly recommend! [REVIEW_5] Great quesodilla with very tender steak and the Chipotle sauce was great.  Serving was big enough for two.  Atmosphere was fun and the service was great. They have good music and I think because they are new they were not terribly crowded. [REVIEW_6] This little shop is chock full of fabulocity!  Whether you're shopping for yourself; a quirky fun birthday gift or stocking stuffer; you'll find exactly what you need here - if even a good laugh.     I love that there's something in every prices range; from cute coin purses; magnets and cards; to beautiful jewelry and local artisan made gifts that I eyed for myself. They also carry Hoosier Mama Bloody Mary & Margarita mixers; which I'd been looking all over for as a gift.  My ex got I think you touched your genitals' hand sanitizer (I loved it; but I'm not sure he was equally amused).   Do yourself a favor and make a day of it in the Mass Ave. Arts district.  Be sure to allow plenty of time to take everything in at Silver in the City. I promise you won't leave empty handed. [REVIEW_7] Delicious! My Burger Up experience was wonderful.  I went with a group of 3 and we were seated pretty quickly after all getting to the place. We had the fried pickles for an appetizer (delicious! thick-cut pickles); and sangria to begin our meal. The sangria changes daily/weekly; so ask about it.  Most of us had the woodstock burger (bacon; cheese; ketchup); and we all loved it! One person in my group had a veggie burger; and he ate the whole thing. The fries were also really good.  We finished our meal with the ice cream and cookies--very good!   Everything was tasty. I particularly liked our waitress--she offered great suggestions; was extremely knowledgable about the menu; and didn't mind us hanging around a bit longer than we probably should have. She was attentive on refilling our drinks; and she seemed happy. My experience was nice; and I hope to return to try a different burger. [REVIEW_8] Beef Noodles Soup is the best here ...they make their own noodles here plus no MSG...fried Dumplings are very good ...their hot sauce homemade is so good [REVIEW_9] I was Yelping for a good dessert spot in the area and came upon Cake Bake Shop. First of all the decorations had me memorized! I loved all of the sparkly girly decorations. The place looks just like something out of Breakfast At Tiffany's. It's super cute. The huge selection of sweets you can order makes it very difficult to choose. The price is higher than normal but it's so worth it! Eat the sweets there or take it go. [REVIEW_10] I was excited to try this place. Decided to meet a friend for a late lunch. The C House says they open at 2:00 in Saturday's. They were open. We ordered. Waited 15 minutes then the waiter appeared saying they were not prepared to serve food. They weren't ready at 3:00 either. No manager came by. Nothing. We left. Total disappointment. Don't open at 2:00 if you can't serve food. Ridiculous. [REVIEW_11] Last night we had a fabulous dinner! The food is very authentic and wonderful. This restaurant is extremely special. The waitstaff couldn't be sweeter or more attentive. Yoichi's is a gem! [REVIEW_12] Tried Cafe Deluxe for the first time with a friend. All the food on the menu looks delicious. I had the deluxe salad with a scoop of egg salad on top; yum yum. Their prices are great; love the veggie options; and large portions! I will be going back.. [REVIEW_13] Our first visit will most certainly not be our last!  We were here for a retirement party and the bar area of the restaurant was marked off for us.  The staff was phenomenal!  Very attentive and ready to fill your drink order the moment you drank the last sip.  The food was amazing.  I am not a burger person but the sliders they had out were presented well; looked great and boy was it good!  The atmosphere is great for lunch; dinner or just drinks with your girlfriends. [REVIEW_14] This is a horrible and unethical company that only has interest in profiting. They refused to fill an override prescription with my retail pharmacy because they sent a letter in advance. The prescription was needed TODAY since it was out.(they take 8 days to deliver meds) I was unaware to begin with that it was now going through them and not my regular pharmacy. They LIED about a few things pertaining to why and how it got to them as well. They tried to pass the buck onto BCBS in getting a one time approval for me to get my MUCH required meds today since I was out. Fortunately; BCBS was still on the other line when this happened. They kept saying they sent a letter; which we never received. That's why they refused to fill the prescription by the way.....because they sent a letter!   So; if you are sick or dying or both and need your meds in order to live; they DON'T CARE. They not only provided the worst service EVER; and LIED; they also HUNG THE PHONE UP on us and the BCBS rep.  A consumer complaint was filed with the BBB as well as through the California Dept. of Health. They have NUMEROUS complaints on here and the BBB!   We also notified our employer as well.    We have been on the phone trying to deal with this for ALMOST FOUR HOURS NOW.   If you're a company that has a choice to use this service; STAY AWAY.   If you're an individual that has the option to opt. out. OPT. OUT!   If your health; and life are worth anything to you or the people around you; STAY AWAY! [REVIEW_15] McMichael's has great food; decent beer selection; and friendly service. I have been here several times; and so far I have enjoyed everything. I especially recommend the Irish Nachos; Garlic Parmesan Chicken Tenders; and Roasted Pork Sandwich (I got it with long hots and sharp provolone).   For a local pub & grill; McMichael's is as good as it gets.",12
4,"[REVIEW_1] I first want to start off with the fact of how much I love Blaze Pizza. I've been here mmmmm about ten times. Well not this exact location; but nevertheless to Blaze Pizza. Tonight's occasion was Friday pizza night with the kids. What made it even more fantastic was the buy one get one free coupon I retrieved from Facebook. I ended up seeing a friend here who also had the coupon. Before I ordered our food I made sure to ask the cashier; Amanda; if it was buy one get one free for all pizzas or per order. She stated for all pizzas. I went ahead and ordered and added my friends order to ours; just to be nice. Once it was time to check out; the same cashier then said no; you can only have one per order. I purposely ordered four pizzas based one what she told me. I was of course puzzled and frustrated. She then turned to who she called the ""general manager"" and said I can only do one right and he said yes without even looking into what was going on. I tried to get his attention but he ignored me. He was a little busy I will add but when something is happening; tend to it. I told her ma'am I only did it this way because of what you told me but of course she acted oblivious. Totally upset me but I decided to just leave with the bill we were given. I was really upset not because of what happened but because of how it was handled. Rudely and unprofessional! [REVIEW_2] One of those places when you leave you ask yourself what just happened? The food (pasta) was the smallest portion of food I've ever been served (served in what looked like a small cereal bowl) anywhere for a whopping $16 and it was terrible. The beer was high gravity bottled beer for $6.50 per 12 ounce bottle and the cheapest small glass of wine was over $9.00. My wife and I had the pasta and 1 beer each and got out for $60.00 somehow. I'm not sure why we as customers give in to actually paying for small/bad food but what can you do when you're with a group of people? I will never go back there; I'll stick to the more reasonable 12 South Taproom which is about 90 feet away on the same side of the road for much cheaper prices and the food is so much better. [REVIEW_3] Horrible food; undercooked sushi rice; pretty much bad everything. Don't waste your time or money [REVIEW_4] In NO on business; and always try to eat where the locals do; or at least avoid the chains. This place came highly recommended. I was all set for a great breakfast; and was so disappointed. Took 30 minutes to get food; which was overcooked after sitting under heat lamps. Totally uninterested and full of attitude service. They were busy; so may have something to do with it; but I won't be back. [REVIEW_5] So seen all the great reviews about this place figured it was as good as it seemed so went there food was great service was great but while waiting for dessert we seen a mouse scurry out of the kitchen then ran around under a couple tables in the dining room then made it back to the kitchen and our waitress seen it and was very embarrassed she acknowledge it and we paid and left don't think I'll be going back!! [REVIEW_6] Staff is friendly. Walters trio enchiladas where terrible and the rice was uncooked; gross. My friends liked the mahi mahi and juicy Lucy burger. [REVIEW_7] We received a coupon for a buy one-get-one; so we decided to try this place. We go to Qdoba all the time; so I thought this would be a similar experience.   Service: All of the staff we interacted with; while placing our food order; were very polite and upbeat. We took our food to go as we live a two minute drive away.   Food: I ordered a chicken burrito bowl and my husband ordered a steak burrito with fajita veggies. I was eating in the home office and bit into quite a few cold chicken pieces. I ate around the chicken as I have an unnatural fear of food poisoning. We live very close to the restaurant; so either the container the chopped chicken in was cold; or the meat was not cooked all the way. I went to go check on my husband in the living room and he stopped eating all together. Half way through his burrito; he found a 4 or so inch long brown hair. Yay for finding hair in your food! I asked him if he wanted me to call the restaurant and he said no. He just tossed his food; as did I.   Four hours later and my stomach is still not agreeing with me. So; go to Chipotle with caution... At least the staff was nice. [REVIEW_8] First time here and definitely loved the food. The atmosphere and staff are great. So much food. I had leftovers for the next day! [REVIEW_9] Worthless. They turn off the WiFi on Sundays!  Now I have a drink and can't get any work done. [REVIEW_10] I travel 40 min from Limerick to see David. I'm never disappointed! The salon is clean and the stylists are all very nice. If you want top quality work; this is where you should be. [REVIEW_11] They've gotten a new wait staff so it might be under new management. The waitress I had was extremely rude. She seemed to be in charge because the other employees seemed to ask her questions. I always try a place twice before I decide on how I feel about it. Both times the same waitress was sneaky and rude. They had a deal 2 months ago if you spent $100 at Hmart then you get a free jajang myun. It was eat in only. The sign said you had 30 days from receipt date to get the meal. The sign was still up when I entered. When I showed the waitress the receipt she said the deal ended yesterday. I try to show her the sign but she had took the sign down. She says in Korean to the other waitress ""she saw the sign so I guess we'll honor the receipt"". I didn't let her know I understood.  I went in again tonight. It was close to 3 pm. She gives us the lunch menu even though lunch is about to end. We saw in the Korean newspaper 7 meal options for $7.99 which is also limited to lunch time. We choose 2 meals and she says annoyed I better quickly put this in because the deal is about to end. I try to order from the lunch menu 2 items to go she tells me it's for eat in only. She snatches the lunch menu and walks away. Later she walks by so my mom tries to get her attention so we can order something to go she completely ignores her and walks away. She doesn't return to our table. We finally get her to come over to our table. We order a meal to go she says annoyed lunch deals are over it's dinner time now. My mom explains she wants it at dinner price so she puts the order in. She never brings our to go meal to our table. Another waitress brings us the receipt without us asking for it or explaining where our meal is. We ask her where it is and she doesn't know. My mom tries to get the nicer waitress over again after 10 minutes and we finally find out our meal was sent to the register area awhile ago. Worst service ever. Stay away. As long as your not trying to get any deals they have to honor you might get better service. [REVIEW_12] Let's start with my first impression ... it wasn't great.  On the door walking in there are images of the credit cards they accept but when you walk to the counter there is a hand written sign that says something to the effect of we do not accept credit cards use the ATM next door.   I told my husband we would need to go elsewhere to eat then. At this point some guy came up to take our order; we commented on the credit card thing and he gave ranted at us for a good while about giving away money because the rate was 3.69% per sale and he cant afford to pay it and the electric and this and that. Like ok whatever dude; you're in business as is the bank you agreed to their terms and conditions when you had it installed to run your business.   He then handed us a menu and said we could order it off of the web from foodcab.net.  At this point I was pretty much over this guys bad attitude and wanted to just walk out of there but my husband was pretty upset as he really wanted BBQ so we ordered off line from the foodcab.net since we could use our credit card.   When we finally got the food to us it was bland and dry. even my cat turned her nose up too it. The corn bread was less like a side dish and more like a dessert.   I physically feel ill after eating this slop as does my husband. [REVIEW_13] I experienced the worst customer service possible I've waited 15 minutes for an employee to ask me if I was being taken care of while my food was done and sitting and also the soda's in the refrigerator were expired and out of date I contacted the manager on duty and the employee did nothing I tried giving them another chance and this continues to be an issue I will no longer come to this location [REVIEW_14] While I was moving in and had all my stuff on my patio the inspector left a note that was threatening : Stating I had inappropriate items on my patio  Trash left out  EXCUSE me but I was moving !!!!!! So I went to the office and a woman named Deborah helped me .. Very condescending .. Acted like I had no right to complain about my note... Then I asked for a copy of my lease.. Oops again ....  We're sorry you can't have that it's under lock and key!!! WHAT!!!!! This volley of info and rudeness continued until she came out and said they were closing the office for the night!! WOW what a difference from my rental I'm Asheville NC.. Friendly clean always remembered who we were even though it was a huge complex.. Ohhh ; they will be friendly when you are looking but once you sign the dotted line ....not so great!!!! You're just a number ; you mean nothing to SENTINAL CORP believe me or they would have a nicer staff and wouldn't have to threaten you when your trying to get all your stuff put away!!!! [REVIEW_15] I love Roma burgers; I try to have one in every city I visit but this location butchered the Roma burger. Over cooked the usually mouth melting burger so it was tough. Over toasted the bun so it was tough. A shame. Next time I will try a different location.",2
5,"[REVIEW_1] This place is perfect for any meal. The owner is the sweetest and most personable lady you will ever meet and the new Korean additions to the menu are out of this world. If you have the chance to go here please do so. [REVIEW_2] Had the best time at 3 muses! Made a reservation (highly recommended as this place is small and BUSY). When we got there; our table was almost ready so the hostess asked us to wait at the bar. We got a drink while we were waiting and the bartender happily transferred our tab to our table. They had a specialty house drink which my boyfriend and I both tried; it wasn't my taste but he loved it. There was a band playing that night; and our table was close by. The band was wonderful; played excellent jazz! The food is served tapas style so it comes out as it's ready. We started with the fries; topped with feta cheese which were perfectly crispy and delicious. We got the bulgogi rice bowl which was flavorful but could have had a little more meat and vegetables to go with the rice. We were still hungry so we got an order of the mac & cheese and the bruschetta which were both phenomenal; I recommend getting each. After my house drink I had one of the beers; the fire ant; which was delicious. At the end of our meal the hostess came by to ask us if we minded moving to the sidebar table as they were behind on the reservations. It was a little offputting to be asked to move after spending $80 on a meal; but I understood and we happily moved. I read reviews that the servicehere was lacking and the bartenders were rude; but this was not our experience. The server was attentive; and the bartender was extremely friendly and helpful in ordering and was happy to transfer our tab for us. We will happily be back on our next visit to New Orleans!! [REVIEW_3] 2nd time here. First time in Philly; we went to eat here. We loved the food and the price is reasonable. We ordered the same stuff; salt and pepper pork chop; saut√©ed string beans and vegetable fried rice. We recommend this place. Accepts credit cards for orders $20 and over. [REVIEW_4] Gypsy Saloon is and has always been one of my favorite restaurants outside of the city. Kim and Marianne are the owners and are totally hands on. Their menu is so fun and amazing. They are always consistent with their food and it has always been my ""go to"". Food is always fresh. The lobster mac and cheese is second to none. A fabulous restaurant not to be missed. Fabulous Brunch; lunch and dinner. You will not be disappointed.....EVER!!!!! [REVIEW_5] Cookies and Canvas is one of our favorite new Saturday morning activities. My daughter has actually started a wall of paintings in our craft room. Totally recommend this for any crafty kid or adult out there. [REVIEW_6] One of best Thai; Malaysian ; Chinese food in Philadelphia . Ecnomical; fresh; nice service; quick and efficient staff . Trendy; you would see a lot of hippy crowd; sometimes gets noisy- nice hosts; better staff- English is a little bit issue with the staff-   It's in the heart of Philly ( Chinatown ).   Been here many times; I recommend it. Try their tea at the beginning which is free of charge.  Update : 6/17/2017. Staff was pushy; came thrice if we are done with the food- they just want you to leave as soon as possible. May be this is common in Chinatown - [REVIEW_7] This place deserves a special mention.. it's not really on the heart of the city (for tourists); but it's definitely a place you should mark down for one brunch at least...shrimp n grits are hands down the best we've had in the city....the juices were fresh... and for a person who has a hard time eating Omelettes; Surrey's has converted me for sure.. the lump crab omelette with the sauce was just the cure for a dull grey rainy morning...! Word of caution-the place is always full; so make sure you get there at least 30 mins before you really want to eat; just to make sure you don't starve over the delish smells that keep on wafting out [REVIEW_8] I was here a few weeks ago and this experience really stood out for my trip. Kerry was a gem; he even helped me locate the coffee shop to purchase their coffee which I fell in love with. I would definitely recommend [REVIEW_9] Have eaten at this place 3 times. Every time was a good experience for me and the kids. No smoke No noise and good food good service. Maybe because it has always been on a late tuesday afternoon we have eaten there. I have always ordered something different and have been satisfied  and happy with what I got. Definitely will be back to eat there again. [REVIEW_10] If you go on the weekends; you might experience up to an hour and a half wait. Hopefully it's not in the rain... like mine was. There's little shelter outside and no waiting room inside besides a small bench to the side.  That being said; it was worth the soaking wet socks and shirt. Hell; Honey's would have been worth getting a cold from exposure to the elements.  In the past; I only went to Honey's for their dessert. Their warm Jewish apple cake served with a side of vanilla ice cream and caramel drizzle is to die far. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.   After seeing their menu for brunch and the list of specials for the week I decided to visit one Saturday with my boyfriend. When we finally were seated at the counter; I was disappointed to discover there was no homemade grapefruit juice but the orange juice was an excellent substitution.  I ordered the chicken and waffles while my boyfriend ordered his staple breakfast burrito. Upon first glance I was super confused. No syrup; a roasted chicken leg over cornbread waffles with a combination of avocado and tomato salsa on top? I had a feeling I was in for disappointment. Apprehensively; I took the first bite of chicken and waffle.  Holy crap. All I could wonder was how the hell they did this!  The chicken was the juiciest most succulent meat I've ever tasted. The dark meat was roasted to perfection and literally was falling off the bone. The cornbread waffle was flaky and full of flavor reminiscent of my Southern Grammy's cornbread muffins. The avocado tomato paste was surprisingly a perfect complement to the spice rub on the chicken leg and paired with the waffle perfectly. Syrup would have been an abomination to that meal.  I begrudgingly shared my dish with my boyfriend who quickly lamented not ordering the same meal. I'm the queen of taking home leftovers but not on that day. I would have licked the damn plate if I wasn't in public.  I left Honey's full and extremely excited to go back and try the next dish on the menu. [REVIEW_11] I wish they served a bigger menu of dim sum because it's amazing here! In my opinion; this is the best place for dim sum in reno (CaiE's oriental cafe seems like they serve pre-frozen dim sum). We order in advance and dine in. Whenever I'm craving chicken feet and siu mai; this is the go to. Unless we can go over the hill to Sac.   They have a good combo meal. I enjoy their sesame chicken with fried rice. Hubby gets beef and broccoli or shrimp and vegetables. Comes with a nice combo appetizer and/or hot cup of soup. [REVIEW_12] Haven't had a chance to try much of what St. Louis has to offer in Mexican since I'm fairly new here. Tried this place and won't be going anywhere else for my Mexican fix. Authentic flavors and textures makes it even better; makes me think my brother-in-law's mother is in the kitchen. Great food; good prices; excellent portion size. [REVIEW_13] Never thought I could sit down at a place like this do work and homework and enjoy a coffee. But this place is amazing. Great to do business and school assignments and enjoy it. Service is great; always seems like they are in a great mood. Still haven't tried the salads but have had every sandwich and they are delicious. [REVIEW_14] Best ice cream in New Orleans!  I personally love the chocolate peanut butter and fudge. [REVIEW_15] Great haircut - needed a quick shape-up for seminar at Rutgers. They came through - highly recommended.",15
6,[REVIEW_1] Catering probably deserves more than two dollar signs ($$) but it is worth the money. Good vegetarian options. Delicious food with gourmet presentation. Entrees; appetizers and sides were all delicious. [REVIEW_2] A high class sushi bar; hot pot station; and if you'd like to cook your own thinly sliced ribs; the Japanese cuisine is here. I was craving buckwheat noodle and knew it was served here. A little expensive but worth every penny. [REVIEW_3] Harbor Seafood is the type of restaurant that's most like a bag of Lay's chips. One visit is never enough.  I can't begin to count the number of patrons I hear say they have just landed at the airport and headed straight over; or they have been in town a few days and already visited multiple times; or are headed home and just had to stop in one more time before the flight home.  The one thing I love most about this restaurant even more than the food is the fact that I can sit at the bar on any given day and I'm just as likely to sit next to a regular as I am to sit next to someone from half way around the world. People literally flock to this hole in the wall neighborhood seafood restaurant.  It's a relatively small restaurant so if you need a table your more than likely going to have to wait. Sometimes when it's real busy there is even a wait for the bar. All seating is first come first served & they do not take reservations. You can also order food to go if you don't have the inclination or the time to sit in the restaurant and eat; but I'll admit this is the type of food that is at its best when you sit in and eat.  Speaking of the food.... All of the fresh fish served in the restaurant is taken from the fresh market which is next door to the restaurant. It's all in the same building just two separate entrances.  There is always a fresh fish of the day on special along with various other specials to tempt your taste buds.   Harbor serves boiled shrimp all year and boiled crawfish and boiled crab when in season; fried or grilled baskets; various seafood po-boys; and seafood salads.  Some of my favorite items to order are: Appetizers... fried calamari; fried pickles; 1/2 blackened gator 1/2 fried gator; cheese sticks; fried crab claws; and fried crawfish tails. Some of my favorite main dishes to order are... Boiled shrimp; fresh fish of the day; stuffed lobster; any of the baskets including stuffed shrimp; catfish; oyster; the combo basket which includes shrimp; catfish; oyster and stuffed crab; also the swamp platter which is a special combo that includes fried crawfish; frog legs; gator; cajun gator sausage; turtle soup; and  crawfish etouffee; and don't laugh at me but I also like to order the kids burger. Harbor also serves raw oysters on the half shell! You can order by the half dozen or dozen; or multiple dozens. There is always an oyster shucker on hand; and they always shuck in full view of the restaurant.  I have to say this: if you order raw oysters; don't forget to tip the shuckers because they are working just has hard as your waiter or waitress. Harbor seafood is my go to restaurant for seafood;  a burger; a drink at the bar after work or any other time of day. I enjoy the variety of people who work here and also enjoy the variety of patrons I come across on any given day; and I'd be lying if I didn't say I enjoy seeing my artwork on the wall in the restaurant.  I've made friends here over the years so all I can say now is; Cheers! Hope to see you at Harbor one day! [REVIEW_4] The name says it all. Best Prime Rib in town. Service is excellent as well. On my 4 day trip to Philly I went twice. [REVIEW_5] A few years ago I bit into my roasted peppers AND a fish hook. The staff could not have cared less; pretty much insinuating I brought the hook with me to put in their food. They didn't even take the dish off the check; even though I wouldn't eat it or anything else after nearly having my gums impaled. I'll never go back & have advised others to stay away. Not even an apology. I should say there was a lot of blood & they couldn't wait to get me out of there (after paying the full bill). Rude does not even begin to describe that staff. [REVIEW_6] My visit at macy's today went quite well. The clerk was very nice; she helped me out a great deal. I Ieft very happy because i got what i wanted; plus a discount. [REVIEW_7] I requested service because my gas oven heating was unreliable: sometimes; when turned on; it would heat as expected; other times it would not heat and I would smell natural gas odor. I was delighted; from the beginning of the process to the end: the person who answered my phone call on Monday and scheduled my appointment was friendly and helpful; appointment was scheduled for Wednesday; which was earlier than appointments offered to me by other appliance repair services that I had called; communication from company - by phone; email; and text - was well-timed and clear; repair technician was on-time and personable; he diagnosed the problem and fixed it efficiently (he had; based on the description that I had given when requesting the appointment; anticipated the cause and brought with him the required replacement component; an igniter); the company waived the service call charge - I paid for the repair (parts and labor) only. [REVIEW_8] Excellent! Love the location-- fun upscale decor. Service was perfect-- knowledgeable; respectful; and fun. I'm sure this place will end up busy and packed; but for now; it feels like a secret I want to keep! We ordered small plates-- flatbread pizza; butternut squash soup; and house salads. Dinner was filet medallions; salmon; burger and tuna poke. Everyone loved their meals and drinks. We will be back soon! [REVIEW_9] This place was worth the wait!  Their lobster pasta was really good ! [REVIEW_10] I read at least 30 reviews before I decided to eat here. The only thing that was good was the oysters because it's raw. Everything else was dry and tasteless. The space is cramp. We had people on our backs coughing on us while sitting at the bar trying to enjoy it. Let's just say the 2 half and half baskets that my boyfriend and I ordered was not worth $60. [REVIEW_11] Delicious as always! My son and I ordered a  Greek Salad and an amazing pizza.  Definitely one of the best pizzas in town! And the salad; especially the dressing; is addictive! The service is great but we go for the food! [REVIEW_12] I have eaten here mainly for breakfast; but the juevos rancheros was amazing.  We did stop in and eat chips and salsa and my wife got one tamale for a snack.  Both were great.  The salsa was a little spicy; which I enjoy and the tamale was home made and delicious.  We'll be back. [REVIEW_13] From the very beginning the hostess was also working as the cashier so we weren't even welcomed when we came in. We had to ask the hostess for a table and we're made to wait for no good reason. The server was pretty much non existent and was very unfriendly she didn't even introduce herself or stop by the table (let alone ask us how our food was). I order the biscuits and gravy and a side of eggs. My food was cold when it came out and wasn't even that good. And on top of it all the food is way overpriced ($30 for French toast; biscuits and gravy; and 2 sides? NO THANKS). Don't even bother wasting your time or money here. Overall terrible; definitely never coming back. [REVIEW_14] This place is awesome. Awesomely expensive; but a good splurge for Sure [REVIEW_15] We were looking forward to trying out this newly redone restaurant. The atmosphere is fresh and well done . We were there for breakfast. They now have table service. Things were great until the food came out. My pancakes tasted like stale bread.  My wife's eggs were cold. The potatoes were not cooked. They brought the wrong side dishes. For silverware; we were given  forks but no knives. It took a while to find a waiter to get the silverware we needed. We did speak to the manager. She offered a discount of $2.50  not that we were looking one; but why bother?). However; she did not remove the extra charge for the incorrect side dish we didn't order ($4.00).  She did apologize for the food verbally but somehow we were made to feel like she couldn't care less. I don't write many reviews unless I really love something or dislike something. This restaurant fits into the latter category. Sorry. A nice decor is not enough.,11
7,"[REVIEW_1] The food was outstanding.  I got chicken tagine; with the delicious tender meat falling off the bone; and carrot salad; flavored with mint and cumin.  Service was good; and the inside of the restaurant is cheerful and well-lit.  Total cost was around $13. [REVIEW_2] WOW!  I come to town once every 4 months and always make sure to stop by here at least once a visit.  That smoked mackerel is just something you can't get anywhere else.  The frosted mug of root beer only makes it better. [REVIEW_3] The worker was awesome; this is a review for the company.  The price paid isn't in alignment to the service provided; it is just expensive. The worker is still paid hourly; which motivates him/her to work the hours. I believe it is a better way to hire someone off craigslist and pay them to do a service; rather than hourly. [REVIEW_4] I went to see Dr. Taylor because a friend recommended him.  He did appear knowledgeable in many areas but did not listen to or honor the reasons for my visit.  Being a naturopath; he is familiar with both natural and allopathic methods of treatment.  Although his staff said he was familiar with the neurological issues I was asking about; he did little to discuss them with me.  He also did not ask if I wanted a more natural or allopathic approach.  He sent me out the door with an allopathic prescription for something he could have easily addressed with a natural approach.  When I called to cancel my follow up appointment; his staff was curt and dismissive and attempted to make me feel badly about cancelling.  He is not someone I would seek out if I was looking for a kind; respectful medical practitioner. [REVIEW_5] I wish I would have read the reviews before stopping here... I drove in looking to quickly get my tires filled with air because my light was on and I was having a difficult time getting them filled up due to my air valve extensions. I told them this and that I was in a hurry because I had an appointment to get to. I told them I only wanted them to fill up my tires and I didn't need them to do their regular inspection because my car is only 3 years old and had been check just a few months ago before moving here. After waiting nearly an hour I asked the man at the counter how much longer it would be and they took me in to the shop... at this point they told me the sensors in my tires either ""all broke at once or didn't have them in the first place."" The mechanic called two places and told me it would cost $800 to get these installed. I told him I wasn't going to pay that because it's not a necessary expense and I wouldn't be able to afford it. At this point I asked if they had even tried filling up my tires with air; to which he told me no. A different mechanic then filled them up with air and told me that the light probably wouldn't go off because of the ""problem with the sensors."" A mile down the road with full tires the light went off! This was not quick or convenient and I do not appreciate men assuming that I do not know anything about cars in an attempt to get me to spend more money to repair problems that don't even exist! [REVIEW_6] Poor service from the door. Stood at the door for 15 mins; walked in when it was not super busy it was Thursday at 12pm. I'm pregnant and there is no more seating area; which I think was a stupid decision when they reopen so they can flip more tables. Was ignored by 2 staff members who seating 3 people before me. Food was cold the times I come in there. The French toast is horrible. They just good making basic eggs that doesn't take much flavor or time. I get the actual egg not the ready made batter. Over fried meats. Burnt has Browns. Save your money & go to a mom & pop local diner to get more for your money. [REVIEW_7] We have been going to this restaurant for about 2 years. We were regulars until now; but after what happened tonight we will never go back. We noticed that our bill was alot more than it usually would be. So we added up the price of each dish and discovered after calling the owner that she added a 20% tip to the bill without our consent. (on top of our own separate tip) We also ordered 4 dishes and were given enough rice for only 2. So we requested more rice and she charged us another $4. To rip us off even more she taxed us on the total bill gratuity included. We confronted her about this and there was no remorse only made up lies about these charges. You dont treat regular customers like this...sorry lady! [REVIEW_8] Horrible experience; pizza was soggy and cold when I received it; took 2 hours until I actually received my order as well. Absolutely no communication on my order; even after calling twice. Once I finally received the pizza I called to get my money back; which was communicated that I would not be charged; soon to find out that I was charged the very next day. I highly recommend never ordering from here; service was horrible and they were extremely rude. I won't be ordering from here again and either should you. [REVIEW_9] Best sushi in Tampa bay! So fresh and great service; and they have an awesome lunch special. [REVIEW_10] I been to a lot of places but this place was gross. I am sorry to say but there was hair in my good and the waitress was rude. [REVIEW_11] Great quality; fast; friendly; and reasonably priced. I went in to get the length on some unfinished pants adjusted; and they had them ready within a few hours; just how I wanted them. Lee; the proprietor; has a great sense of humor and seems like he loves interacting with customers. [REVIEW_12] Good food; great service.  Hard to beat.  One of the best restaurants in Indianapolis. [REVIEW_13] Love this place. Every time I'm in SB we eat here. Always fresh specials. Lots of fun!!! [REVIEW_14] Not feeling this place! I was so excited about this place opening in Philly area! The place has NO atmosphere at all! It is all the same colors and is very boring! You couldn't tell who was an employee and who was a customer! They had no T-shirts or anything! The line was long; because they only have 1 register; no menu board on the wall or anything. Place is very cheap though with their prices so I will give em that! They don't even have a fountain soda machine; or an ice machine. The food all tasted the same! Really bland and flavorless! I asked for extra salsa; and they said I had to pay for it! Really? How do you sell a HUGE basket of chips; and give 1 small 3 oz cup of salsa? Also when I went; they had no sign so I blew by the place! Don't open unless your ready to open; and obviously this place isn't ready! I can't see this here for more than a year or so! [REVIEW_15] It is unfortunate that with such a unique location and such a brand and product offering this specific store offers such lousy service. The wait is endless; no one is available to help and at Christmas time getting a gift wrap is act of God that requires endless wait. I bought gifts and knew that the wait for wrapping would be long SO I even left my items at the store to be gift wrapped at their leisure. They were not even moved from the counter where I bought them when I returned almost two hours later ready for pick up. This was a gift that needed to be given and The staff COMPLETELY ""dropped the ball"" on my time constraints!   I love their stuff; but today was my last shopping experience at this location: couldn't get a gift wrapped after being assured that it could be done in a timely fashion???  I'll  cancel my card; do everything online and try not to go there if I can. It's really a shame!",6
8,"[REVIEW_1] Tasty kimchi bowl fried rice bowl ($9.99) with bits of pork. I added an extra helping of beef ($1.5) and had it made in brown rice ($1). It came oozing hot chili oil; with delicately cut egg pieces and green scallions on top and a free cup of miso soup too. The bowl and fork were made of recyclable bamboo in a modern design. The lady at the counter; Kelly; is super friendly; it's so nice to be served by spirited happiness. The music is nonintrusive elevator but quite pleasant. The AC comforting against the dry hot Reno air. I did fall asleep right after finishing my bowl which usually means the ingredients - rice; oil; meat; egg - are not of the highest quality. But I don't blame them since you really have to go to places that really advertise ""organic grass fed wild caught highest quality"" etc to get real food these days. I'm on a lazy journey passing thru town just for 6 hours before my Greyhound bus takes me to Las Vegas. It's a short walk from the Greyhound station and expecting not much. In this light; Bob delivered with flying colors. [REVIEW_2] To the reviewer who said 'best Carne Asada burrito ever'; absolutely agree! It's yummy; and huge. The Carne Asada in general is excellent at this restaurant. Their shrimp is excellent and their tacos are good. Honestly I haven't had anything here that I didn't like. The food is really good and very authentic Mexican. Before taking your order they bring you chips and salsa. The chips are authentic themselves; which means they're not all salty as you would expect American chips to be. But you don't need them salty when there's salsa; plus they bring you limes which are an excellent addition if you squeeze them over the chips.   The staff is very friendly and helpful but not in your face as at some restaurants. The building is nice; and it's a really pleasant atmosphere. Plus the food doesn't take very long to come.  It's definitely not a fancy restaurant; so if you're looking for someplace for a special occasion you might want to look elsewhere. But it's clean; neat and extremely relaxing inside. So if you're looking for good Mexican food; this is definitely the place to go! [REVIEW_3] Wow!!! Thank you so much for the awesome customer service and quality tint job! It is very refreshing to know that businesses like yours still exist -where customer service comes first and sound quality is ALWAYS produced! We will be sure to share our experience with others*=) -the one window-ed Versa [REVIEW_4] Today was our first visit; it's a cool little place in a nice neighborhood. Thankfully they have their own parking lot but there's plenty of street parking too; which is good because it was packed. The inside was nice and cozy and it had plenty of seating; not that it mattered because it was so crowded but I can't fault them for that.  The customer service was really good; although the guy who took our order didn't seem to believe that I knew what a double shot macchiato would be because he kept asking me if I had ever had one before. I badly needed pure caffeine so it was just what I wanted; I'm just not sure what the questioning about my choice was all about.  That being said; when I got it it was great; obviously good quality espresso. My husband got their popular hot chocolate which he wasn't a fan of but I really liked since it tasted like actual chocolate instead of like a powder. He also got an espresso bar which was some kind of sugary chocolate treat; and he loved that. Their to go cups are also really cute. It's out of the way but we'll definitely be back. [REVIEW_5] Fantastic food and service! Gumbo ya-ya was delicious; as was the braised rabbit. Also; martinis were excellent. [REVIEW_6] Very good for breakfast. The portions are huge. Our server Frank was very attentive and made sure everything was great. The manager Tim came over and we ask if we needed something cooked special for allergy reasons and he said yes they can accommodate for that; just let the server know when ordering. Coffee is very good and my wife had the tea and it was also good. [REVIEW_7] This is a great place to stay. I picked it because of the full kitchen; it was very helpful. We didn't spend as much money on food. Its very clean and cute! [REVIEW_8] Love these guys. I've been here twice now for two completely different experiences and both were wonderful. The first was as a guest at a wedding shower. They were helpful and courteous and the food they served was amazing.   Second visit was to bring my sister to a place that she could hopefully eat something at without worrying. She has lots of food allergies (dairy; gluten; soy) that really limit her ability to go out anywhere. She loved her food choices here. We came for breakfast and sat outside and were visited by ""Henry"" a big white bird that frequently hangs around. One of the staff (maybe the owner) came out when they saw a little boy trying to get close to Henry and helped him go across the parking lot away from where we were eating to feed him special food they brought out front. This was adorable and helped to teach Henry to learn that he gets food away from the people outside eating. And you should have seen how happy the little boy was. Excellent experience (both times!). [REVIEW_9] Craving sushi tonight but wanted to get away from the norm. I remembered Kei Sushi and headed over to that part of town.  We walked in to a nice; pleasant atmosphere and were seated quickly. The ambience and decor are great and it's not overly loud.  Our sushi chef; Isiah; made some nice suggestions right off the bat a they were delicious. The nigiri was very fresh and full of flavor.  My favorites of the night were the ceviche appetizer; the pink lady and the albacore.  Will put on the top of my list for sushi. [REVIEW_10] Hands down the best place I've ever gone to.  Now that I've moved to DC I hardly know where to go!  The first time I walked in; I had a lot of long hair that I knew I wanted to get rid of.  I wanted to go short -- not bob short; but short-short.  I had a few pictures of cuts I liked; but  no real idea of what would look good on me.  I sat down with Ellen; we chatted for a bit; and she soon suggested a style that I thought sounded promising.  And it ended up being more than promising--it was fantastic!  I loved it; my friends loved it; and even my family liked it (high praise).  It's a cliche to point out; maybe; but i got more compliments from strangers on my hair the months after getting it cut than I'd heard for years prior.  I eventually decided to grow it back out; and kept coming back to V Vegaz and Ellen for trims and cuts along the way.  I think we can all admit that growing hair out from above your jaw to below your collarbones is going to take a very long time and be irritating no matter what.  However; working with Ellen made that a far less frustrating and a far more flattering process than it would have been otherwise.    As for more general things; the atmosphere of the salon is lovely--very well-designed without being intimidating or cold.  I never had any trouble scheduling appointments; and; thanks to the receptionist Michelle's help; was even able to fit a trim at the last minute when I accidentally showed up to the salon on the wrong day.  If you're looking for a great cut; not just a good cut; this is it. [REVIEW_11] It was cheap. Course was nice enough. Great set of rental ping clubs. Friendly staff! [REVIEW_12] It has been a long time since we ate here. But we were getting tired of the same-old; same-old and the husband suggested we try it again. What a mistake. The place looks old and tired. NO atmosphere. But the service was prompt and friendly. We ordered our meals.... fish and chips for me and an open-faced roast beef sandwich for my husband. My dish arrived with three healthy  pieces of scrod in a very eggy looking breading. Fake fries (you know; reconstituted potato parts shaped like fries) and a very mayonnaise - y tartar sauce. The fish was edible. The fries were not. But the real surprise was the horrendous meal my husband was served. Instead of beautiful roast beef; he received fatty; chewy brisket; shiny gravy and those awful excuses for fries. We should have been suspicious when they offered neither a baked potato nor mashed potatoes. Nevertheless; he dug in. He hated the dish and ate very little of it. The waitress questioned him about it and he said he didn't like it.   She came back to tell us that the meat came from the end of the roast (thus the overcooked texture and heavy fat content). Even as we paid the bill; the owner apologized for serving such a lousy cut of beef. Then why serve it???? It makes no sense. In the meantime; my fish was just passable. Not inedible... but not very good.   They did reduce the bill and gave us a $5 off coupon. But too little too late. If you hurry; you will find the coupon in the entrance to the restaurant.   We won't be back; so you are welcome to use it. Though I wouldn't recommend that you do. [REVIEW_13] Been here for lunch so many times. They are always so consistent and the food is Asoooo delicious. Love the Massuman curry lunch special with Tom kha soup. So so good!! Also their Thai tea is the best I've ever had and I've had my fair share of Thai tea. I cannot recommend enough for lunch when in the Phoenixville area. [REVIEW_14] Amazing; authentic; super delicious food. I know its authentic because my wife is Afghan and trust me; I know about authentic Afghan food. Try their Awshak or Buloni for appetizer and Qabuli pulao or Mutton kabob for main course and top it up with Firni for dessert. Excellent service; clean atmosphere and friendly hosts. [REVIEW_15] As an avid knitter; I try to find a local yarn store pretty much wherever I travel. I was delighted to discover that The Quarter Stitch was walking distance from my hotel AND they had a special Mardi Gras yarn in stock. I ended up visiting the store twice while I was in NOLA; once to grab the Mardi Gras yarn and a second time because their selection was just delectable. Added bonus; the staff was amazing and super helpful. I would definitely visit this store again.",14
9,[REVIEW_1] The perfect combination of class and culture.  We came here this afternoon for the first time and were so pleasantly surprised. The IMA itself has tons of really nice exhibits full of artwork from various cultures and eras. Our favorite was the contemporary section on the top floor.   There's also an amazing outdoor garden area with tons of beautiful blooms and plenty of paths to take and spend your afternoon strolling the outdoors. Best part? There's a beer garden! Such a great way to spend your afternoon when it's gorgeous weather outside. Additionally; in the summer they offer mini golf and outdoor movies too. So cool.   On top of all of that; if you're a student; undergrad or graduate; you can receive a free year long membership! This place is definitely worth stopping by if you're looking for a fun and unique way to spend some time in Indy! [REVIEW_2] Fun fun place.  Service is always friendly not always fast. But always friendly and the good is pretty darn good [REVIEW_3] Reasonable price; lots of selection.  The prime rib and meat was great.  The salads are grazed over but you can't help that in a buffet.  We had planned on eating at circus circus but this was the best choice. There were lots of people there but the wait staff was excellent. [REVIEW_4] We wandered into this eatery quite by accident (we saw it on yelp after a morning of sightseeing) We were warmly greeted and served promptly. One had the meatloaf sandwich and one the shrimp scampi with linguine. Both entrees were fresh and wonderful. Tucson; you are fortunate to have this new restaurant/sports bar. [REVIEW_5] Freaky fast is a joke here.  It regularly takes over a hour to receive a lunch delivery from this location.  After three instances of this I am done.  I will not order from this location again. [REVIEW_6] My girlfriend and I had the best time here!  Definitely the most fun and relaxed place for wine tastings. Great wines with good prices. We will for sure be back. [REVIEW_7] This is a great way to spend some time in New Orleans.  The swamp we went to was really beautiful and there was so much wildlife.  I had friends from out of town who had never been here before - they  were blown away!  We saw alligators; wild pigs; raccoons; turtles; snakes and lots of moving water (not sure what was down there).  The Captain was wonderful - he know everything about the area and answered everyone's questions completely.  He really made the tour not only a lot of fun but very educational.  He had everyone on board's attention; from 2 yrs old to 75+!  Will definitely put this on my list of things to do when I have company.  We'll be back! [REVIEW_8] First of all; I can't believe this place is FREE!!!!  If I lived nearby; I'd be here almost every day. So much fun for little kids. I would have easily paid $3 to get in.   In fact; I recommend you guys start charging and hire some more staff. The toys need to be cleaned and so do the slides. [REVIEW_9] Fantastic dentist!! Dr. Jaffari & team treat you like a person; not just a patient but are so comprehensive in their treatment. Cannot speak highly enough. [REVIEW_10] I am so glad we had our wedding here!!! I cannot say enough what a pleasure it was to work with Breanna; the venue manager and Eli; the food and beverage director. Our wedding here was a destination wedding; so we were very concerned about making sure all of our family and friends that travelled a long way to get to our wedding had a good time. Being a couple straight out of grad school; we were also very concerned with keeping the cost manageable. Everything worked out on all accounts!   We first picked the venue for two reasons: the price was right and the venue is GORGEOUS. The pricing was very straightforward; which we really appreciated; and when looking at other options in the Santa Barbara area; the Riviera mansion was pretty comparable with other venues which are not all inclusive (ones where you have to find your own caterer; rent linens; etc etc). Planning a wedding without a coordinator and from across the country; it was also definitely worth it for us to go with a venue that minimized the amount of details we would have to think about.  The looks and layout of the place are what sold us though. With people coming from the east coast and middle of the country; we wanted something that would really showcase Santa Barbara's cool architecture and vibe. The mansion is exactly that.  The layout is also pretty perfect for a multigenerational wedding. We were able to enjoy the California weather for our ceremony and cocktail hour outside; then go inside for dinner; avoiding the cooler night air. Later; we could turn up the party in the bar/dance floor area; while the older folks talked and relaxed on the couches in the living room. It really has something for everyone.  What I didn't realize when we picked it was how absolutely awesome all the staff would be to work with. Breanna was super helpful; answering all my questions promptly and pleasantly; and accommodating my sometimes short notice visits to the area. When we did our walkthrough a couple of days before the wedding; Breanna and Eli paid attention to every detail and made sure we were taken care of; as they did the day of the wedding too. Eli was incredibly attentive and easy to work with! My dad is in the restaurant industry and was in charge of setting up desserts (we had family make some traditional desserts; as well as got some cupcakes from Enjoy Cupcakes- also a great idea!). Eli worked with him to get whatever he needed; risers; tablecloths; etc and was really sweet about it.   The attention to bartending at the Riviera Mansion deserves a paragraph of its own. Breanna worked with me and the bartender (who's name I forget but has worked there for 20 years and is also incredibly awesome) to create a peach moscow mule as our signature drink (our colors were peach and green) and get it to taste just right. She even arranged it so we had fresh peaches! At the wedding; everyone raved about them; even guests who usually prefer something more manly sounding. The staff had all drinks ready to go for our cocktail hour; and also passed trays of drinks; so there was never a line at the bar (something guests also specifically mentioned that they appreciated). Hell; Eli even followed me with my drink for a couple of minutes around dinner since my hands were full of other things! Really spectacular and attentive service.  Five stars all around. It was absolutely a joy to have our wedding here. [REVIEW_11] I go to this subway once a week; the people who work in here have been her for years and really know how to load a sub up with everything you like; the place is always clean and the folks are friendly; best subway around. [REVIEW_12] Really really good.  I had the vegetarian spring rolls and chicken pho. The broth was incredible. Awesome fast and friendly service! Highly recommend! [REVIEW_13] Apparently they make a point to come tell me that I am parked in  one of the take out spots and that I have to move. They have no open parking so I obliged and drove and parked around the corner. Sitting here inside and having ordered I notice that there are STILL two other cars parked in takeout spots and have not moved nor are they looking to the patrons who own them to ask them to move.  Boy- do I feel special.  I'm skipping this place next time. [REVIEW_14] I really wanted to like Casselli's; but it wasn't in the cards. Maybe I just caught them on a bad night; but I didn't really enjoy much about my visit. The waiter was very unpleasant - was banging down the plates and glasses on the table when he delivered them. Maybe he was having a bad day; but I still would have expected better.   We had mixed experiences with the food. Mine and our friends' was OK; but my wife's baked ravioli would have been more use to a hockey team for use as pucks. They were really overdone - woefully overdone.   The worst part was that our table was next to the opera singer guy. He was singing extremely loudly and it was nigh impossible to maintain a conversation - especially coupled with how close we were to the table next to us and their attempts to speak over Opera Guy.  Part of me wants to give them another chance (since I hate writing bad reviews) and the other part is annoyed over the waiter's attitude. I probably will not go back. There are so many good Italian restaurants worth visiting that the opportunity cost of returning to Casselli's seems too high.  On the upside; they have somewhat convenient parking in the lot behind the restaurant (near the Shawmont School).  Note: cash-only. [REVIEW_15] Haven't tried the restaurant but the bakery I can assure you is as As Greek as Greek can be. From traditional pastries to pastries with a twist you will not be disappointed. Always fresh always good.  Service with a smile.   Lively Greek music encourages you to not only   sing along but dance too.,12
10,"[REVIEW_1] I've been here a handful of times; and bagels have always been delicious. I visited the shop on 5/19/18; and this will be my last visit. I went there because I was hungry and in need of food; but it seemed like I walked into the middle of classic P.T. Barnum show: clowns juggling while riding unicycles and elephants parading around on their hind legs. The first employee I interacted with; at the ""bulk"" bagel counter; didn't hesitate to let me know that I was attempting to order from the wrong location. Fair enough. They did have a sign on the counter; but it wasn't as conspicuous as an ""order here"" sign that dangles from the ceiling. Her tone made it clear to me that I had already committed one transgression. I then order from the attendant at the POS. I clarified my complicated order of a breakfast sandwich and two toasted everything bagels with a tomato and garlic cream cheese; three times. The first clarification was that I wanted everything bagels; not plain. The second  clarification was directed toward me because they actually have garlic and herb cream cheese; not garlic cream cheese. The third was my reiteration of the tomato and the quantity of the said bagels. At this point I had more confidence in a drunk ESL Uber driver getting me home safely than my order being prepared as per my request. After waiting for my extravagant order to be prepared to imperfection and gazing at the yellow ceiling grid with stalactites of black dust; my name was called and the first employee I interacted with hastily handed me my bagel bag. On the ride home I asked my partner in crime to ensure that there were 3 bagels in the bag because they probably ""F-ed"" the order up. He assured me that the quantity was correct. When I got home; I feverishly ripped open the wrapping on the two everything bagels; like a joyous child on Christmas Day; only to find     that the bagels had the tomatoes omitted and the cream cheese barely exceeded a skim coat. The breakfast sandwich was anemic at best with barely any protein on it. I am so glad that I expected disappointment. Honestly I'm not too upset because closer to my house there is a new bagel shop: Red House bagels; where the staff is courteous; the shop is cleaner; and the bagels a bit larger. Red House is my new bagel stop.  Sorry Newtown Bagel Co; you've been replaced. Although your actual bagels are slightly better tasting; it is not enough to reconcile the pain points associated with your operations. My words of advice; replace (don't clean) your ceiling tiles and clean the filth from the grid. Having almost 10 years of food and beverage experience; I would hate to see what your walk-in and floors behind the counter look like. Coach your employees on courteous service; or maybe treat them better and they might pass that on to your patrons. Oh and maybe write the orders down before entering them into the POS; because sometimes those machines aren't as navigable for some operators. I'd like to keep going on about this; but I am probably beating an already abused P.T. Barnum animal. [REVIEW_2] This is my favorite place to enjoy gelato in St. Louis.   Consider the...   Coffee house-like atmosphere.  Large outdoor patio with a fountain and surrounding foliage.  Delicious gelato and baked goods.   Yes; everything at Gelateria is pleasing. [REVIEW_3] I Love Love LOVE Trader Joes! This is my favorite grocery store of all time. I wish they would build on in Bloomington; I only get to go there when visiting family in Indy. This location is great; friendly staff always clean and a fun place to shop.   TJ's is crazy different from any other grocery store and most people don't know! A few things about Trader Joes:  1. Everything with the Trader Joe's Logo is  -GMO FREE -Has No artificial Coloring -Has No artificial Preservatives  2.You can try anything is the store!! As long as it doesn't have to be heated (frozen meals etc) you can bring it to the sample station and they will open it for you to try!! I'm talking Cheese; juice; fruits; ice cream; yogurt; chips; protein bars; cereals; candy..anything!  3. They are always sampling items!! While most stores do this for you to buy things (of course they want you to buy it too) Trader Joe's actually wants you to try something you normally would never buy.  They have so many unique and different foods; this lets you try something you may have never even seen in the store before.  4. They always have new products!! This is good and bad; because if you are a fan of a seasonal item you have to stock up when you see it.  Not only do they have certain items that come out seasonally but they are always introducing new items every week.  They even have a New Item Shelf that you can check out so you don't miss anything.  Again though the down side is they are a small store and if certain items don't sell great you may never see them again.  5. You can return anything; no questions asked!  They want you to try new things and if you don't like it just bring back the receipt or an empty wrapper and they will refund you on the spot.  It's also good if something you buy spoils fast.  6. Every store has a mascot (a stuffed animal) the staff hides it everyday so that kids can look for it.  When you find it; go to the sample station for your free Lolipop.  Its a great idea and a great way to keep kids occupied as parents shop.  Those are just some of the main things that set TJ's apart.  It is such a fun and colorful store to be in.  Everyone that works there is always in a good mood and there is always someone around to help you. [REVIEW_4] I was so looking forward to a Pho joint in the neighborhood.  no anymore !     Four neighbors went at different times and all had the same opinion as we did.  I know that they are new ; but at this rate; they won't be around much longer. [REVIEW_5] Really? $45.00 to ""hold my rate?"" The trick fees and surprise billing that shows up in my checking account every few months is garbage. The monthly fee doesn't sound so bad; but the surprise fees and the $100.00 fee to cancel the account is somewhat discouraging as well.   You can work out here if you're rich and have money to blow; but being a member here has severe financial disadvantages. [REVIEW_6] This is the worst. My first time at an Econo anything. Playing nice for group purposes. We get here. They check us in like the rooms are clean. The rooms are dirty. The lady comes to clean the room because apparently they dont have any others clean or available. Go figure. So the manager comes outside to look as if we are lying about dirty rooms. It's hot as hell outside; wasps everywhere and we're standing here. I asked about other clean rooms and he (a-hole manager) (neil Patel) sarcastically states check in is at 2. It's 1:45 though. If you're going to check guest in at least make sure the rooms are clean or let them know it will be a few. So I'm standing outside in the heat as they apparently clean the room.  They took no cleaner in to clean counters; bathroom; etc. Just nasty. Then they just looked in the microwave & fridge to see if it was clean. They didn't wipe nothing. I would never stay at this filthy mofo or any Econo Lodge. Just nasty. Go w/ a big brand like Marriot; Starwood or Hilton where customer satisfaction is part of their branding scope. This -ish is for the birds and folks who need a place for a quickie.... Not even that. [REVIEW_7] Decent food but have some weird priorities and service quality is quite poor. Didn't take our orders until after we sat waiting for twenty min. Food took fourth min and a gentleman sat down after us and finished his food before we even got an apology that our food would be a while. Asked for water and was ignored or forgotten twice. Decent quality food but not worth the wait or poor service. In and out would have been better.. I take it back food was rushed and salt bombs made half the dish inedible and the other half bland [REVIEW_8] If I could give Zero stars I would. We are return customers to this restaurant and now we will never return. We will go out of our way to go to the one in mid-city. We ordered the new sandwich ""The BET"" and paid an extra $2.00 for extra cheese. We received this sandwich with close to ZERO cheese. You would think for a ""cheese"" themed restaurant all of their sandwiches would be gooey with cheese. WRONG. The cheese on the sandwich didn't even cover 1/2 of the 1/2 of one side of the piece of bread. We mentioned it to Ebony at the register that we paid for extra cheese and showed her the sandwich. She brought it to the kitchen and shortly returned to us with our sandwich in hand and said ""my kitchen supervisor said there is cheese on this sandwich and he can't help us"" we asked if we can just add more cheese and she said ""if we want more cheese we will have to pay for it"" (which we already did) ""and he refuses to remake it"" terrible kitchen staff and HORRIBLE at handling service. [REVIEW_9] My family and company used mayflower in late sept of 2013. What a complete mess; from the packing to the delivery. We moved from Southern California to Minot North Dakota for work. We had so much damaged items that it was hard to keep track of. We were told by a rep that our items had been off loaded to a warehouse after loading up at our house to be loaded back up in a moving van (with air ride) well this didn't happen; the same rental freight trailer that was used at the loading showed up at delivery; another lie from the company.The scheduling date was a mess also; the funny thing is the company reps in Minot tried to blame us for their mistakes. We have been in contact with California for this to be resolved and to this date 1-3-14 we still haven't received a call say sorry for the f!?"" Ups. Our salesman in California turned out to be just that a salesman; he didn't give a rats a!$ about anything and refused to return my calls. I would never recommend this company to anyone. Please check out other companies first !!!  Hey mayflower executives I am sure you know who I am ; feel free to call me to apologize and to get input on how this should have been handled !! I would not have given 1 star except it would not let me continue to post !!! [REVIEW_10] Truly awful! I chose this as my birthday lunch place with a friend. The counter clerk/meal maker was disinterested; bordering on rude. This is a small place; so four dirty; unbussed tables are noticeable. After cleaning our own table; we waited and waited. There was no one ahead of us. Finally our paninis were served: both were badly burned. Who serves burned food; unless you just don't care? The salad was bland. The coffee was fine. [REVIEW_11] DON'T BOTHER GETTING THE GROUPON. The sushi was terrible and they DIDN'T HONOR the Groupon because I didn't present it when I was seated. I've used many; many Groupons in other establishments and have never been refused. I called Groupon and got a refund from them and reported that Yakuza did not accept it.  BIG THUMBS DOWN for Yakuza; thumbs up for Groupon. [REVIEW_12] Not my first time there tonight but absolutely my last.  I am beyond sick to my stomach (literally) as I type this and so are my 3 friends that went there with me tonight. Eat here at your own risk; we had a friend in from out of state and it ruined our night. [REVIEW_13] Can't really recommend Jack Flash Electric. I called them a month ago to make an appointment to get a live wire terminated in my house. It took them almost a week to return my call. The receptionist said she'd need to call me back to make an appointment and they just never contacted me again. I can't do weekend appointments; so I understand that there needed to be some wiggle room with their schedule. But they should have at least contacted me to tell me they couldn't do the work. [REVIEW_14] I am not sure they deserve one star..but they do not deserve two. Went this afternoon shortly after lunchtime. Walked in and was seated with my girl near the buffet. We discussed eating from it...but decided against it. I haven't been to a CM since the one left the Foothills mall many years ago....I never had any issue with anything at that location. The one on Campbell was not good. Server was polite; but when she came and gave us silverware...it was as if she was playing tiddlywinks...I was a bit perplexed when my three pieces were laid down knife....spoon over knife at a 45 degree angle; then the fork over top the same way...about 6 inches from my napkin. I hadn't thought about it until now...but I feel she was trying in code to tell me not to eat there. Yeah....that has to be it. I looked at the fork...and it looked as if it was taken from the table behind us....as they were using it....it was replaced with a clean one....I am hoping it was anyways...at least there was nothing on it that I could see...and that is 90% of the battle. On to the food. I ordered a chorizo burro. $9.00. This was the driest chorizo I have ever eaten....as my girth with attest.....I have had much chorizo in my life. About three hours after.....I feel yucky. Anyways.....I will not be returning here. [REVIEW_15] Our sales person C.C was great she did everything she can to get me into the car; i was approved was handed the keys to the car etc. even had me put all my things from my trade in car to my new car; once we get to the finance dept. to sign the final paperwork; We were there for about 4hours that day; they tell me that they forgot to include sales tax from my lease trade in to the car I'm purchasing; which would bring my payments up to $24 per month which would bring my monthly payments to about $491 instead of the $461 we agreed on or i could pay the $930 est. now. I advise them all i could do was the amount we agreed on could not put down anything more. The next day i have Nick contact me and stated if i put down another $1;000 they could help me out; i stated  i could not; he basically told me that ""we are doing you a favor and helping you out due to your credit history; you could pay this now or later but you will have to pay the sales tax"". I felt like he was talking down to me and very unprofessional; i advised him could anything else be done since it was a error on there part; he basically stated no; and said if i could not make another $1;000 down on top of the $1;000 I' already putting down there nothing they could do; and kept saying we are bascially helping you out b/c of your credit history and just kept repeating it; when i stated i could not; he hung up the phone. This has been the worse delearship i honestly have been to; after spending 4hours on Saturday there and another 4hours on Monday..",2
11,"[REVIEW_1] My husband and I go here often and we have yet to have a bad meal.  Love this place! Wonderful service; wonderful food; wonderful everything! Worth your time!! [REVIEW_2] It's ironic that you asked me to call you with no number. Before placing this review; I called and asked for a managers email ; they said they don't have email addresses; I left a voicemail and the manager didn't even bother to call back. 3 days later I get a call from another sales rep. I know it can be busy within a day's work but no call back for 3 days ? This is unacceptable for a business who is looking to sell cars. Thank you for answering my review. [REVIEW_3] The worst body shop ever. They will blame you for their mistake. Don't go here if you have a Mercedes or BMW.  Honestly they did a good job on the paint but they are careless. They scratched up my leather seats; drain my battery; and my panels is not installed right. [REVIEW_4] I ordered the 1st day they were open from grubhub for carryout. They accepted my order and said it was ready before I walked in. I walked into the restaurant and not only was my order not ready; but everyone who ordered at the counter getting their meal before mine; and they were getting it for half price.   I watched 9 people come in; order; and get their food before me; but pay half what I did because I ordered online. I sat there for 45 minutes despite the fact that I ordered ahead of everyone else there; paid double what they did for their food; and was confirmed that the order was ready.  I was apologized to frequently for the wait; but at no point was I offered any explanation as to why I waited 9 times longer than those ordering at the counter; or why they told grubhub it was ready; or why it was charged at twice the price as at the counter (delivered I would understand; but I picked it up).   I live a block and a half away (315 N Senate). I had hoped it would be a place that I could carry out from often; but I was thoroughly disappointed. All said; the food was OK; but the experience was absolutely horrible. Due to that experience I would recommend either Bento Asian (mostly Japanese; $2.50 delivery) or the China King at 148 N Deleware (free delivery) for Asian delivery or carry-out. DO NOT ORDER HERE FROM GRUBHUB OR ANY OTHER CARYOUT/DELIVERY APP/SITE. [REVIEW_5] Went on the Cupcake and Macaroon Tour last weekend.  We went to four places.  The first business was a glorified coffee shop.  No cupcakes or macaroons. We were given half of a ricotta cookie.  Although delicious; it was not a cupcake or macaroon.  The second place gave us a quarter of a cupcake. They did not have enough of each flavor; so when it was my turn; the one I wanted was gone. The third establishment was so awful; they should have paid me to try their sample.  It was a vegan bakery free of gluten; dairy; nut; soy; egg and any other allergen one can think of.  I am sensitive to people with food allergies as my husband has them; but I'm not sure why this establishment was included.  How can a cupcake taste good after you've removed all of the key ingredients?  The last place we went to was the one that was supposed to have macaroons.  We were told they ""ran out"" and instead received a quarter of a defrosted mediocre cupcake.  How do I know it had been frozen and not fresh?  It was still partially frozen in the center!  Luckily; it was a beautiful day to be outside; because this tour left a lot to be desired. [REVIEW_6] Never had Malaysian food before eating here; but it's extremely good.  Roti canai was an excellent appetizer; almost better than the breads at dedicated Indian restaurants.  The noodle dishes are also delicious.  Atmosphere was great; I'll be back soon. [REVIEW_7] They offer lunch and dinner combos. Great prices. Food was ok. They play uncensored rap music through out the restaurant. No biggie I like that. Service was a D+.   Ethics...  I rated 1 star because I bought a restaurant.com gift card and was not able to use on the lunch combos. They call them ""specials"" (restaurant.com certificate not good towards specials) thus not able to get the ""everyday combos"". After factoring that I had to pay full price vs their combo price; it was pointless to use the gift card. I saved $3 vs the $15 value on the card. (Lost the $3 considering gas cost driving from Brandon in search for a good sushi joint)  Dear Sake House; you lost me forever over this combined with poor service. Maybe I'm being too critical but I for sure will never; ever be back. Specials should be specials not every day values on your standard menu. Especially if you are selling restaurant.com gift cards!!!!!!! [REVIEW_8] So incredibly disappointed in this restaurant.  We were so excited to try this new location of Herbie's and it did not live up to expectations.  The food was not to the quality of the prices that they charged on the menu.  The hostess sat us and the older manager was visibly not happy with where we were seated in the restaurant.  The french onion soup lacked flavor and could have used salt and pepper.  It lacked the beefy/wine flavoring that a good french onion soup should have in it.  The Beef Wellington; although beautifully presented was disappointing.  It lacked flavor and had no seasoning in it.  The Mushrooms/spinach/red pepper medley that it was paired with had CANNED red peppers in it. Seriously; a $25.00+plus dish with canned/jarred red peppers? It was like baby food.  The Flank steak had no seasoning to it and the sauce that it was served with it also lacked flavor and tasted like Mayo.  The chicken with shaved brussels sprouts salad was underwhelming.  The ""1/2 chicken"" was the size of a cornish hen. The server sold us on their ""amazing"" red velvet donuts for dessert.  That was a mistake. The donuts were hard and not warm; the ""white chocolate"" icing was hard as well and there was stale broken up donuts sprinkled around the plate with the chocolate.  The coffee was also luke warm.  We will not be back.  Herbie's needs to revisit their seasoning in the kitchen STAT and rework their menu. [REVIEW_9] This is my favorite place to enjoy gelato in St. Louis.   Consider the...   Coffee house-like atmosphere.  Large outdoor patio with a fountain and surrounding foliage.  Delicious gelato and baked goods.   Yes; everything at Gelateria is pleasing. [REVIEW_10] This place is a dirty hole.  Avoid it. They have unfriendly service; crappy beer selection and they have no problems over serving the already inebriated customers.   There is such a seedy element to this place.   In the span of 4 days; 2 men were attacked on the sidewalk after closing time.   I have nothing against guys smoking weed; but the gauntlet of smokers that you have to wade through to get in or out of the bar is just gross.  Ever notice how it's impossible to get a taxi to come to this bar? [REVIEW_11] Came down from Jersey after seeing the Dan Band perform; which was phenomenal! We got the urge to order a hookah with a liquor option. Walked over to Fez.. no one attended us at first so we sat down at the couch area. The place was dead for 10pm Friday.   The attendant came and said let me seat you someplace else. I asked to keep the seat I was already at. He said we couldn't; so I told him to speak to whomever to get the approval. The guy came out and ask what's the problem. I said hey boss; your place is dead and we'd like to sit at the large couch area. He said they can't because that's for parties of 8. I said I understand; but there was no one in your store and if that big party ever came; we would move. Their answer: no we can't.   I said no problem; packed my things and was ready to walk out. The guy asked are you really leaving? I said bro; no one is here. The place is dead. What do I have to do? Order a bottle? He said no again.. so.. went to a better spot! Saqqara Hookah bear broad across from City Diner! So much better staff! No young deutche bags trying to show how much more testosterone they have.  Saqqara had great fast hookah service; really really great food and best part; was their service. They actually made the effort to cater to their guest.   Fez.. you are the old 2017. Do better 2018! Saqqara; keep up the great work! You'll squash the competition in no time! [REVIEW_12] Ewww!!! I used to go to this location all the time; the staff was always friendly and I could count on it being good. There was also usually always an employee cleaning. However; after the experience I had today; I certainly won't be returning. The place was filthy. Food all over the window in front of where you order; food all over the floor; and food on almost every single table. I bit into my taco and thought it tasted weird; then looked and discovered that the chicken was dark meat with skin on it. Wtf happened to this place? I'm really disappointed. Please fix this store; no place where food is eaten should be this disgusting. [REVIEW_13] Went because a friend ask me to meet her there. It lived up to all the bad reviews given. It was 7pm 3 people at the bar; bartender playing on her phone & talking to her friend at the end of the bar. No hello; can I get you something? After standing at the bar for a while she finally came over. I ordered a beer which she handed me unopened. I paid and walk to the table my friend and 3 others were sitting. At about 8pm 15 very young people walked in and had an even longer wait for her to even acknowledge there presence. I was guessing for Karaoke which doesn't start till 9pm. I left at 8:30pm. I have no idea how they stay in business and certainly don't know how she makes any money. Clearly the owner is not interested in making this a place to go. I went to the Old Double D many many years ago and I bet the original owner is glad he's gone-he should have never let them keep the name. [REVIEW_14] Stayed here the day of our wedding. The first room smelled like cigarettes. The second room smelled like chlorine. Mind you I don't have a good sense of smell either. [REVIEW_15] Our first time is our last time.  Worst margaritas we've had anywhere.  What Mexican restaurant can't make a good margarita??  Each of our meals was boring and unauthentic.  My burrito came wrapped in a piece of foil served on a plate (felt like I had hit a drive thru).   No sides...just one chicken burrito for $9.99.   When we tried to use our $3 off $15 coupon we were told we couldn't use it.  Really?  After spending almost $50 on three regular margaritas and two entrees (no appetizers and no desserts and yes it cost that much).   Extremely overpriced; poor service; boring food.",3
12,"[REVIEW_1] We were VERY disappointed with West Side Gravy.  My fried chicken was two small legs and a thigh; all undercooked;  served in a paper cone; with very small sides of tasteless potato salad and so-so coleslaw.  My iced tea tasted sour.  My wife had the lobster roll which was quite small and tasted mediocre at best.  My son had a hamburger and fries which was fine.  The service was adequate; but nothing special.  Not worth the $50+ (plus tip).  We will not return . The big reason for our disappointment is the fact that The Blackbird Restaurant (attached) is run by the same chef; share the same kitchen and the Blackbird is terrific. [REVIEW_2] I just read through all of these reviews and giggled over everyone's unique opinion on what exactly the Goleta K-Mart smells like. My own instincts whisper to me ""cat pee."" And yes! a little sulphur (read that in someone else's review; thanks!) Having lived with cats all my life; it smells like home. This isn't a good thing.  It's almost impressive how bad the check-out is. You can find the shortest line; where there is one or no people in front of you; and it will STILL take you like 20 minutes to get through the line. The last time I went; my nail polish rang up as $82 for some weird fucking reason (probably because their computer system is from like 1983) and then the girl had to do the whole thing over again. The penultimate time I was here; I managed to get in a very short line only to have the lady in front of me decide to sign up for a Sears credit card (REALLY WHO DOES THIS SHIT) at the check-out. Which took an impressively long amount of time. Will I still come here to buy my hair dye? Sadly; yes; because it's like half the price of the grocery store. And lord help me if my natural hair color starts growing in.  Also; I seriously almost run someone over every time I try to park. Not in anger; but just because it seems like the elderly like to hide behind cars and then jump into my view at the last second. It's almost like a conspiracy. hmmm....  well; here's hoping someone finally finds the courage to blow the motherfucker up one day. [REVIEW_3] As a caveat; I give this place one star for the following reasons: the owner of this place is a very reasonable woman; and previous to my last god AWFUL experience here she gave me a great wax/facial several times; and was completely professional.  HOWEVER; my problem w/ this place was the massage I had. I read a comment below from a woman who had a masseur named Kai; and I had a similarly awful experience with this man.  Let me start by saying that I brought my roommate w/ me to get massages before we had final exams last spring; and that we both had an equally unpleasant experience. First of all; we did not know we'd have masseurs giving us massages until we got to the place. Secondly; we waited about an hour our massage; and we arrived to the salon fifteen minutes early to be courteous and on time.   Anyway; the SAME thing happened to me-- the masseur; Kai; kept the blanket off me for too long; and he rubbed a bit higher than most masseurs are supposed to. He also  creepily suggested to me that I should be a lingerie football model during the massage. Fortunately for me; I was not alone w/ this man. My roommate was in the same room (although we had requested to be in separate rooms; which was very weird).  I would also like to add we could hear the man in the next room getting a massage b/c the rooms were only separated by curtains. The entire process was disturbing and uncomfortable; and I'm alarmed this woman still has a business going.   Oh wait- there's more. My roommate's masseur also argued with her that he was rubbing as hard as he could when my roommate asked for more pressure. We both asked for deep tissue massages; and the guys honestly didn't do much else but rub us down inappropriately w/ some oil. We are very easygoing people; but when you pay over 100.00 for an hr massage; we expect to get what we paid for. My roommate's masseur also ran to the bathroom during the massage; and let's just say the doors were very; very thin... and we heard everything. He then tried to massage her afterwards; but we were both so grossed out by the two men that we asked to leave early.  The massages were HIGHLY inappropriate; disturbing; and uncomfortable. Like the other woman commented below; my masseur; Kail; got way too close to certain areas to the point where I had to ask him to stop because I was so uncomfortable. He also did not cut his nails before the massage; and I had a red scratch mark on my upper back for weeks. He ALSO told me to call him if I wanted a further massage. Needless to say; the only person I ever called from that salon again was the manager the next day to get my money back for the service-- she even offered me a free facial; but I said that wouldn't be necessary b/c I was never coming back.  This all happened last spring; and I honestly I probably blocked this experience out of my mind until I recently looked up reviews myself for a salon in the Philly area.  I'm also very shocked the manager has decided to keep these two shmucks around. [REVIEW_4] You think Value City; you think cheap value; right? Wrong!   Think Rothman prices with Ashley Furniture pieces. Not a Broyhill in sight.   Negatives: - Entertainment centers and TV stand selection is small; and over priced selection. -Their ""Clearance"" section is laughable and not much of a sale. No one is going to pay $299 for a nicked up coffee table that was originally $350. Go lower.  - Sectionals by themselves average around $1;000 by brands I've never heard of.  - The staff hangs out like a clique chatting in the middle of the store rather than helping customers.  -Dining sets are nothing special and overpriced as well. I've seen the same selection everywhere else at a lower price.  -5% military discount? Ooooh you're going to knock $20 off my sofa!   Only Positive: -They have a few modern pieces.   Overall:  I think they're high for low quality-mediocre furniture. Shop around town. Or if you do find something you must have here; wait for a holiday sale. [REVIEW_5] I concur with the other comments that this place is awful.   The service here was about as bad as I have ever seen.   The food arrived cold and had to be sent back - which of course turned into a big ordeal.    Until the management here shows some leadership and sets some higher expectations of their service and kitchen staff; I would avoid this place. [REVIEW_6] I came here for a Sunday lunch. Didn't expect much; since it always seems touristy. If you want reheated frozen food; this is your place. Decor is not good; food is not good. Boo. Bathroom was clean. That's earns it A star.  Poor tourists! If they come to Philly and come here; they are getting a very poor representation of what Philly has to offer in dining. Very poor; indeed! Take a picture of the mural and keep walking. There are many; many better places on South St. and around the corners on 2nd; 3rd; and 4th streets. [REVIEW_7] My son got a pho and thought it was ok. My daughter got the tofu pad Thai and she said it was horrible. It tasted very bland; with almost no flavor; also; it was super spicy!! All in all; we didn't really like the food here. [REVIEW_8] I must have been unconscious because I stood in some kind of a line for several hours for nothing... not only was it terrible but it was also the most unorganized mess I have ever seen in my life. Save your money and time buy beer instead [REVIEW_9] I've been here a handful of times and it's always because I don't have time to go to VN Nails near Costco where I prefer to go (they get 5 stars from me).  Kiwi Nail has always done a cheap job trying to take shortcuts wherever possible.  But today I've had it and will never go back!  After getting the typical shabby job on a fill with French tips;  I accidentally smudged two nails really badly.  They needed to be repainted and I asked her to do so... I even offered to pay extra.  The nail tech came over to look and she pressed the clumps back down and painted right back over the mess (didn't even keep the paint in the lines) then slathered so much varnish over the train wreck that it was literally dripping down my finger. After my nails were dry enough to leave;  another tech rang me up and the receipt had no place for a tip.  When I asked;  he told me I had to pay tips in cash... Well it's lucky for me I didn't have any cash.  He said I will have to tip her next time.  NEXT TIME??!!  yeah right!  There will be no next time! Save yourself the hassle and don't bother with this d@mn place! [REVIEW_10] This tour is highly recommended. As a local; they do give you a good taste of new orleans. From gumbo to jambalaya to a muffaletta to a poboy. Very good tour. This is my second tme taking it! Preston was an animated tour guide and very fun to be around. [REVIEW_11] Just ordered delivery tonight; food arrived so hot and delicious we were so impressed. Absolutely delicious and reasonable pricing! Best Italian delivery around. We had the tortellini and another pasta dish and they were both divine. [REVIEW_12] Horrible service and food. Service was terrible. The management staff seemed to congregate at the wait station and chat with the servers in an unprofessional manner. At 8:30 on a Friday night the clean up guy was dragging rug mats thru the dining area. [REVIEW_13] Amazing. Sous vide pork chop was everything I hoped it would be. Best creme br√ªl√©e I've ever had. [REVIEW_14] My partner and I went there for brunch today. Average food; terrible service. Restrooms are so dirty.  Skip it if you may; so many other much better alternatives in town for brunch. [REVIEW_15] I took my family in to eat last Saturday after the Cardinals game and this place was absolutely disgusting.  There was food like half slices of pizza and ravioli all over the floor. Several used napkins on the floor and dirt and crumbs everywhere. I understand it is as after a game; but the amount of dirt that had builded up couldn't have been just for one day; unless the floors literally hadn't been picked up or swept since opening that morning.  Not to mention they were terribly understaffed.",3
13,"[REVIEW_1] Ugh.  Next to the 8.5"" x 11"" piece of paper menu; this place committed my 2nd least favorite Philly Food Establishment No-No: One Waiter to Rule them All.  Food proprietors; I have a questions for you.  It's lunch time; you're located downtown; it's your busiest time.  How many waiters do you staff?  If  you answered ""one""; please stop.  I know times are tough but waiting 45 minutes for 4 cubes of chicken in combination with some rice is not appropriate; especially at lunch time.    This one was especially bad.  He wasn't lazy but just awkward.  And he did all the food at one time; seemingly.    The food was delicious but I barely remember it as I was suffering from ""foodsanity"" where I was waiting so long that I forgot why I had come there in the first place. [REVIEW_2] This review is strictly based on Leslie - an employee at the Goleta store.  She has been very rude on two separate visits to the store.  We entered this evening; and I was so insulted by her behavior I left without ordering the cake for my son's birthday.  We love the cakes and come in pretty often.  I will not come in any more if Leslie is working. [REVIEW_3] I love happy pets inn. We have used them on several occasions and our dogs have always come home happy; clean and anxiety free. The staff is very friendly and the dogs feel comfortable . I will use them again and again. [REVIEW_4] I had a bad experience here a few years ago. We came for a valentine's dinner; and made reservations a month in advance. When we got there; even though we had a reservation; we waited over 30 minutes. We were eventually seated right next to their back door entrance; which people entered and exited through the whole night. It was snowing out; and every time that door opened; a blast of cold air hit our table. It was not pleasant; and when we asked to move we were told there was no where to move us to. On top of all that; the food was lousy and way overpriced. [REVIEW_5] Me and my friend paid to get our open water certification. Dennis Koslin was the instructor and was the most disrespectful ""teacher"" I have ever worked with in my life. I put quotes around the word teacher due to the fact that this was not a learning environment. If you asked any question during the class he would not answer it and would attempt to make a joke out of you as a person (unrelated to the question you asked). If you're looking for a fun learning experience where you feel fine to ask questions; this is not the place for you. If you are looking to be respected on a basic human level; this is not the place for you. If you want to be treated like an animal and for him to speak down to you; this is the place for you.  His father (the guy who runs the actual shop) was very kind and informative. [REVIEW_6] This place is terrible! I've been coming here for a few years with my daughters and although they are more stingy with toppings than other salad works - my kids don't mind. Usually most of their toppings get easily transferred to my salad. However today; Alexa who's the shift leader said ""toppings don't transfer"" and even though my daughter didn't get a topping and they don't offer a discount - I can't get her topping on my salad. It's utterly ridiculous to consistently pay $30 for 3 salads every two weeks at this establishment but thanks to Alexa - I won't be coming here EVER AGAIN. THANKS! [REVIEW_7] BeAutiful; clean spa. Rachel was my masseuse -- highly recommend! Her attention to detail was in point and unlike any other massage I've ever had. [REVIEW_8] This place is terrible. They wouldn't serve me because of the color of my skin. We ended up waiting for our shitball ass food for 2 hours and one 8 oz drink took us 45 minutes. Very polite and courteous waiter though [REVIEW_9] One day after a really long 2 hour class; I was incredibly hungry. I am not a big food truck eater and after walking by I decided; eh why not?  I figured I would order and go home. I ordered the Mexican Chicken Platter and headed to my car. The aroma of the of the warm food had me wanting just a small bite. I figured one small bite and go home and enjoy the rest. Well see; sometimes things do not go according to plan! I couldn't stop eating. One bite just wasn't enough! You see I was so incredibly hungry and this was so incredibly awesome. I finished eating most of the dish and the feel good relaxed chemicals in my brain started flowing. [REVIEW_10] Had the worst experience with the part owner woman that took off my acrylics yesterday. She literally shaved down with the drill my entire natural nail to the skin on 2 fingers completely and leaving spots of skin on other nails.  I am scared I will get an infection. I am left with very painful nails and very damaged nails. This place should be closed down for such inexperienced owners. I thought I had the best; since she said she was part owner. She totally did not know how to take off acrylics.If my fingers end up infected; trust me you will hear from me and I will make sure you are liable. [REVIEW_11] What kind of business do these guys run? They don't update their website and they don't tell you where the truck is located. It's a shame because I was craving some Korean food. [REVIEW_12] Offers ""All you can eat to go"" but follows and tells you what food you can and cannot have without charging extra after paying full price.   Would give No stars if I could. [REVIEW_13] Worst Wawa ever. It's filthy. Being filthy isn't even the worst part of this store. The worst part is the customer service; or lack there of. The employees here act as if they are being forced to work....and they ain't happy about it. I went to the cashier to pay and since I didn't receive a greeting; I extended one myself. Nothing. No hello; no goodbye; no thanks and have a good day. I find it hard to believe this store can't obtain better employees who aren't angry that they have to come to work at Wawa. Someone from management may want to clean house. [REVIEW_14] I have tried nearly every Hilton chain hotel in the Nashville downtown area and am running out of options.  I travel extensively; spending at least 200 nights per year in hotels; with most of those being the Hilton chain.  I've come to expect a certain level of service.  The Garden Inn at Vanderbilt consistently fails to live up to even minimum expectations as have other Hilton chain hotels in the downtown area (Homewood and Doubletree).  Inept and often condescending front desk staff; awful wireless; bland surroundings and generally bad service.  My team and I will be trying a new hotel brand! [REVIEW_15] We arrived a few minutes early for a 7pm reservation. When we asked for our table; both hostesses looking at their paper; then said they'd have to go check and would be back. 5 minutes later; they returned and did not acknowledge us. Meanwhile; another large party arrived without a reservation and were told it would be a 40 minute wait. We then heard one hostess say to the other that she didn't want to seat them soon because the kitchen was backed up and people were waiting 40 minutes for their appetizers. So unprofessional. We walked up again; after they continued to ignore us; and asked about our table. They weren't apologetic when they told us that the girl we spoke to earlier that day was new and never recorded our reservation. They continued to tell us that it would be at least a 20 minute wait before they could put our table together. We got a smug ""I'm sorry; but she was new"" and they brushed us off. I really understand that sometimes things just don't go the way they were supposed to and that people make mistakes. However; a little customer service would have gone a long way. Offer us some water; or a seat at the bar or say that you're doing everything you can to get us in as soon as possible. They basically blew us off and blamed it on the new girl.  Needless to say we left and I will not be returning.",3
14,"[REVIEW_1] Stopped in on a Monday around 7pm and the place was pretty full.  The bartender was friendly and attentive.  The bar seemed well stocked; not a drinker so take that as you will.  Now the food...THE FOOD was fantastic!  I ordered the Pear Gorgonzola Melt.  How they fit all that amazingness on one plate is impressive.  The clientele is all ages and backgrounds; which is great.  Nutshell:  Definitely check this place out for a good sandwich at a good price (~$10) and to catch up on the footy games. [REVIEW_2] Rude employees. Suggested I was lying about trying to place an online order online with cash as an option. I could not use cash as the option as a ""guest"" and I did not want to create an account as I usually use much higher quality pizzerias when I am looking for a pie. I understand this is just a chain store but as a costumer you still expect to not be treated rudely. [REVIEW_3] This place has all you really need: hotdogs; bomb relish; and beer. Oh; and it's open late. The variety of dogs is cool; and I haven't had one that I don't like. The location is prime for late night noms. I've always had great customer service there; and speed of service is good; but not great. I heard there was new management and the last time I went I noticed faster service. Keep it up! [REVIEW_4] Beautiful place with an amazing carousel bar. The drinks were great. If you're looking for a perfect place for a slip-n-fall; here it is! [REVIEW_5] My favorite taco place in SB; the carne asada is the best in town; the al pastor is not as consistently good as the asada; but can be delicious on good days.  Great salsa bar with escabeche and they give you fresh chips with all meals.  I would like to try more of their menu but the tacos are soo good i keep getting those instead. [REVIEW_6] I've gotten my hair cut twice now by Ryan. He was the friendliest and cut my hair exactly has described. I will be returning a third time! [REVIEW_7] Cajun Encounters ... matching tourists with gators since 19somethingsomething  They have a pickup route in NoLa so if one misses it; one can still get to a later stop and get on. Its a pretty comfortable ride to the swamp. You'll get to see (while in the shuttle bus) the abandoned Six Flags along the way.  Fair warning - BYOB. There is a little convenience shop where you pay fully for your ticket; but no booze. And the food gave some people stomach pains. But you can find various gator jerky.   There are modular bathrooms that flush and have running water.  The swamp tour is pretty cool; you get to go under one of the lift bridges (?; they don't draw up in the middle; but lift straight up via four gears). You'll see grass lands; swamp lands; old trees; houses on stilts; and maybe some swamp folk. If you're lucky; you'll see some animals and stuff. We saw a baby gator; a big gator; a tiny raccoon; an angry raccoon; an egret; and a heron.   It might drag on for a while so don't drink too much - you'll be dying for the bathroom. Fun! Definitely don't need to do it again. [REVIEW_8] This is great place to eat. The food was better than expected. Don't let the looks of the place fool you. Some of the best atmosphere I've ever experienced. Amber; our waitress was very attentive and efficient. A pleasurable experience for sure. If you get a chance you really need to check it out. [REVIEW_9] 240 Studio; the owner Michelle Lee; and all the staff are super supportive and truly provide a professional as well as inspiring and creative place to work. The light is fantastic; and the vibe energizing. It's the perfect place for me to work and create! [REVIEW_10] We were really excited to try the Sunday Brunch . We just moved to Dunedin and have been to many spots on Main Street ( Living Room; Casa Tina ; Black Pearl; Pisces; Bon Appetite; Sea Sea Riders ) and had great food and fun . We got there around noon and it was busy . The hostess was sort of confusing but we told her table for two inside . She gave us a pager and showed us to the bar . The bar seats were full so we sort of stood by the door . We were there around 10 minutes when another couple came in and checked in at the hostess stand and came into the bar to wait . About 20 minutes later I checked in at hostess stand and was surprised they were working off two waiting lists - I thought that was odd . The hostess told me not too much longer . The next couple sat was the couple who came in 10 minutes after us . We were called by the host who proceeded to seat us outside . I told him we had asked for inside he was very nice and apologized saying he thought we were first available but now saw we had asked for inside . As we walked back to the bar we saw the 10 minute arriving after us couple at their inside table and decided to leave . We told the hostess ;who really only cared what number our pager was ; that we were upset and she seemed not to really care at all . After repeating that I was upset about the couple being sat before us she mumbled something about coming back and trying them again ! What ?!! Too many places on Main Street for that kind of service . We go out a lot and we won't be going to Kelly's again . We stoped in on Thursday night to the outside bar and asked the new bartender ( she was sweet but not trained ) if it was happy hour she said she didn't know and had to go find out . We enjoyed our drink watching the new bartender and bar back decide what she was going to eat ... that should have been a clue not to try Brunch . [REVIEW_11] I love this place. Best sushi in Tampa. The staff is always friendly and dies a great job. I've never had a bad experience here. You can sit at the bar and watch them create your meal or a table. They have free WiFi so you can make it a working meal.  They do deliver which is another bonus.  I've had them deliver several times and the online system is a little clunky and one time we had a rude experience when the driver couldn't figure out how our condo gate worked. [REVIEW_12] Dudes.  Seriously... so good. So so soooo good.  The rutabaga fries are the most amazing thing ever.  The rutabaga cheese is better than any real cheese wiz I've ever had in my life.  The Reuben cheesesteak may or may not have also brought a tear to my eyes.  I mean;  this place is amazing.  The""pot holes"" brownies. Holy crap. We ate one before we got our food.. ate;  left and turned around and went in and bought 2more. That didn't make it back to Jersey with us.   Don't judge me.  Try one; you'll see. I wish there was more seating;  but other than that; there's not one bad thing to say.  Some of the best vegan food we've had yet.  Thanks wiz kid!! [REVIEW_13] The Barrio IPA is awesome! Paired with beer sponges and you have a great treat!  A+ [REVIEW_14] The pineapple fried rice that I ordered was very delicious. Also service is good and the environment is very positive. [REVIEW_15] This place deserves a special mention.. it's not really on the heart of the city (for tourists); but it's definitely a place you should mark down for one brunch at least...shrimp n grits are hands down the best we've had in the city....the juices were fresh... and for a person who has a hard time eating Omelettes; Surrey's has converted me for sure.. the lump crab omelette with the sauce was just the cure for a dull grey rainy morning...! Word of caution-the place is always full; so make sure you get there at least 30 mins before you really want to eat; just to make sure you don't starve over the delish smells that keep on wafting out",13
15,"[REVIEW_1] I absolutely love Jimmy Johns. I will never come back to this one.  They screwed up my ordered and their first response was ""Sorry; we can't take the sandwich back after its served. That's a health code violation.""   Too many places that care about my business for that crap. [REVIEW_2] This service does not deliver. We paid for round trip service in advance from the airport to our hotel and from the hotel back to the airport 4 days later.  The limo did not show up as promised on the return trip.  After waiting 20 minutes; we took a taxi to avoid missing our flight.  After returning home we called to get a refund for the service back to the airport.  We were rudely accused of not waiting for the limo (despite needing to catch a flight).  She said she would have to talk to the manager.  We never heard back form them and have filed a complaint with the credit card company to acquire the refund.  DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE! [REVIEW_3] Bread tasted old and was dry. Beef had no flavor and there was hardly any provolone. This is a big disappointment and will definitely hurt the brand name over this airport excuse. [REVIEW_4] I have been a loyal customer of Bairds for many years.  The service has been good until now.  On June 5th I brought 4 pieces to Bairds to clean; 2 pants and 2 women's blazers.  When I went to pick them up on Saturday; only the pants were there.  I looked on the system screen in the store with the employee and the system showed a qty of 4 pieces and then an adjustment done by a employee of minus 2 pieces. The store employee said ""not to worry that this happens sometimes. they must have just needed more time on the two pieces"".  I came back today to pick up the 2 blazers and the store employee said ""we dont show that we have anything for you"". I asked what the system showed and he said that only 2 pieces were submitted on the order; and that he saw no qty adjustments! I am furious; as clearly someone deleted any record of my blazers; one only 1 a week old; Tahari brand and the other a custom tailored jacket from Nordstroms. The manager is supposed to call me tomorrow. Let's see how they handle it. I will let you all in the internet world know how I am treated.  Right now I am furious...stay tuned. [REVIEW_5] I'm sure the food is great - it's too bad I didn't have a chance to try it. The service was probably one of the worst that I've ever received; which is too bad because it seemed pretty nice otherwise.  I arrived with my fianc√© and the place was full so we were asked to wait by the entrance. No problem. A small table opened up after about 10 min; and instead of taking us to the table; the waitress led us to the bar. I usually don't like sitting at the bar because I'm short; and this bar was exceptionally tall. When sitting; the countertop came above my chest and I wasn't able to rest my arms comfortably. Who wants to eat like that? We requested to be seated at the table that was just cleared; and she informed us that she wanted to give that table to the family behind us with a child. Okay; fine; I understand that children can't sit at the bar; so we agreed to let them have the table. We let the waitress at the bar know that we wanted to move to the next available table and she said sure; no issue. Another waitress comes by to take our order; we explain our situation; and she comments that if we want to wait for a table; we shouldn't be sitting at the bar; like it's our fault for being at the bar in the first place. She did acknowledge at least that there were plenty of open bar seats at the time; so it was ok for us to sit there ""for now"". After another 5 minutes; the first waitress comes over and asks us again ""Are you sure you don't want to sit at the bar? If you move to the table you will have to wait longer for the food to come out."" At this point; I'm frustrated but I've already invested some time. We tell her (again) that we do not want to sit at the bar; but if waiting for the food is an issue; then can we order now please? They take our order; and after another 10 minutes; we see another open up. Not unreasonably; we thought that would be our table... Until we see the same waitress gesturing to another party waiting at the entrance; letting them know that will be their table. She comes over and tells us that she had already promised that table to them; and asks us again if we're sure we don't want to sit at the bar. At this point; we were so fed up that we just walked out.  I thought that we had been plenty understanding and even let that family go ahead of us; but they were just completely taking advantage of our patience and niceness. If this is how you treat your customers; I don't care how good your food tastes. I'd give this place 0 stars if I could. [REVIEW_6] I'd like to update my review from a few years back. My how things can change. This place is now a 1-star joke. The food has gone downhill at all the restaurants. The 10 dollar parking is ridiculous (thankfully I'm an elite player so woohoo free parking) but my biggest gripe now is this ""bounce back"" play is AWFUL!! How can you truly expect someone who goes through $1000  in 2 days time to be happy with a measly $30 in free play. I plan on taking my mom to Fresh Harvest for her birthday and after that; you will NOT see me anymore. I'd rather drive to Immokalee or to the East Coast [REVIEW_7] Can't believe this pit stays open. Like walking into a Fellini set. Disgusting. Dirty. [REVIEW_8] Mahi Mahi was great; large portion. You could split a meal.You must like smoked fish. Server was pleasant. [REVIEW_9] I would have rather put a hundred dollars down the toilet. Terrible food; prices and service.  This place is a joke. I emailed them many times to let them know how our experience was; only to have our emails returned undeliverable again and again. I own a business and I would have wanted to know how it was being run; employees not giving a hoot about the place; it's food or the most important...it's customers. It's a shame. Shame on them. [REVIEW_10] Normally; evaluating a fast food chain would be absurd but..Church's Chicken rocks! So much better than KFC and if you are nursing a hangover; this hits the spot. The biscuits are buttery; sweet goodness. Mashed taters and gravy consistency is perfection. The right amount of stiffness without being a brick although I recommend a little salt and pepper to spruce up the taste.  Just like I remember from my Southern upbringing. Do not count calories at this place. And no; I do not make it a habit to hit up Church's on a weekly basis. I consider I nice treat every couple of months. Price is good and service is fast even when there is a line and there usually is a line at this location on Lindbergh in South County. If I am going to do fast food; this is my place of choice. [REVIEW_11] OMG!  Seriously; some of these best cornbread I have ever had.  We discovered this family owned place during our last trip to the NO back in 2005.  It was so good we went back for 2 additional hits of their buttery cornbread.  It's crack I tellya; crack.  Why the hell else would I take a picture of it.   The fried seafood is really good too.  Go for lunch; if my memory is correct they have a different menu at lunch and I think they only serve their cornbread at lunch time. [REVIEW_12] They have a lot to learn about service. The male bartender was super apathetic and seemingly annoyed by our existence...ex: when taking our brunch order he just walked up and said ""Food?"" In general he couldn't be bothered to interact with us; let alone do it with any hospitality.   Lousy drinks --  the mimosas are a ripoff. We ordered a carafe; but it was 90% juice; only the neck was topped off w/ sparkling wine. We're not ordering juice here; people; we're ordering drinks! A mimosa should be mostly sparkling and topped w/ juice. I asked if he could add more but his adjustment made no difference. But here's the kicker -- when a friend of the apathetic bartender sat next to us; she was welcomed with smiles and jovial hospitality; and when she ordered a mimosa guess what she got? 90% sparkling wine; topped with juice! You know; the way they're supposed to be made.  Clearly there's no front-of-house manager to oversee and ensure good service.  Food-wise; it's meh. The forgettable $13 & $15 entrees didn't come with sides; so you gotta pay extra to have potatoes or grits or bacon w/ those eggs.  Sorry guys; but New Orleans is a food and hospitality town....You aren't even trying. I don't imagine Morrow's will be around unless you step up your game in a major way. (and writing yourself fake reviews wasn't the solution -- glad Yelp removed them!) [REVIEW_13] I went when they first opened and I didn't want to judge too harshly because it's a new place. I waited several weeks to try again; even worse!! We came for a show with a band and sat at a high top table by the bar. Nobody came by to say hi or ask about drinks. We waited 15 minutes and still not service; I get it; it's busy. So I go to the bar. The bartender is busy with other guest; she says she will be right with me; 15 mins later still haven't been helped. The manager is very present and visible the whole time.  He is yelling at servers and comparing about not doing their jobs. But he doesn't even notice that I have not been helped yet. Finally another bartender helps me and I walk my drinks back to my party. Still nobody has come by our table. We were there for a while and no server has come by and the manager was very oblivious to our distaste or the fact we needed help. On top of that; there was crazy feedback on the music and you couldn't even hear the singing. We finished our beers and went elsewhere. Very disappointing. [REVIEW_14] Went to this store for an alignment;  when I parked the mechanics were just sitting with no work to do. At 8:30 this is not a good sing for the shop. They checked my vehicle and then notified me at I needed approx $1500.00 in repairs. They even said things that were just replaced needed to be replaced. Drove to my normal mechanic and only needed 2 parts for about 1/6 of the price.  Would not go to this place again. [REVIEW_15] My boyfriend and I decided to go to The Smiling Elephant on a Friday night. We had about a 30 minute wait. Once we got inside we ordered. I got the Gai Jee and asked for it to be ""hot"". They gave me a sauce on the side. I poured it on top of my grilled chicken and white rice. I ate it and the sauce tasted awful. I thought maybe I was being picky so I let my boyfriend try. He thought it smelled and tasted awful. The only part of my meal that I could eat was the grilled chicken which was good; but not worth the price. Also the next day I was sick with food poisoning the entire day. I have never had food poisoning in my life and that was the only thing I had eaten differently in the past two days.  On the other hand. My boyfriend had the Pad Thai and he loved it. I tried it and it tasted pretty good.   No matter how good the Pad Thai was; I am not going to risk getting sick or getting a terrible meal again.",3
16,[REVIEW_1] If you are going to the Mall; you have to check this place out.  Ordered a fish taco just to experience the flavor and quality.  Impressed with service; friendly and ready to take your order.  Very very good quality of food.  It's not your average food place.  It's good !!  The double layer of taco with different crunch and flavor ; perfect.  Fresh and flavorful and well worth the expense.  You don't have a fish taco that falls apart like every other place.  And the garnish melds perfectly with the taco. Great food; well worth the price.  Those that know good food;  Go !  Don't pass this up.  Enjoy. [REVIEW_2] We ordered hamburgers and had to take the aweful meat off just to stomach it. Waiter apolgized but still charged us full price plus $.95 per topping instead of menu price of $.50. Also took 13 mins to ring our check up as he waited other tables. [REVIEW_3] quite the professional response Caroline.  yes i do have quite a palate. eating off the streets of Manhattan for years makes one quite the critic.  salty=too much freaking salt. do you understand this?  and medium lamb doesn't mean a plate of blood you reject.  grow up and take criticism well; you are a small/ok place-  deal with it. [REVIEW_4] This is such a great coffee shop and a great addition to east kensington.   I love the music they play here and the vibe is so friendly and inviting. [REVIEW_5] Neil and the crew down at Gardens Of Babylon are incredible! The go extremely out of their way to help answer questions; offer organic gardening techniques; outsource supplies for projects... The list goes on. Having them on-site was another great experience! They were able to get a better grasp of what my landscapes conditions were... Which is challenging (too much pooling water; no sunlight). They go above and beyond to make sure that I stay under budget but to also make sure what will and will not work to ensure a long lasting beautiful landscape. I'd recommend these guys until I was blue in the face. A+++ [REVIEW_6] I chose to dine at Ralph's for my birthday dinner and I am so glad I did!   Food was deliciousssss; service was great and the interior is beautiful.  I will definitely come back to try other items on the menu! [REVIEW_7] i eat at kabob n grill once or twice a week for months now...every single time the restaurant is perfectly clean n the food is always perfect too...every one i have sent there also seems to become a lifetime customer...things are done on a very high level at kabob n grill...i am very fussy n the food i eat is very important to me...it's got to taste great; but it has to be prepared with a very strict n high standard...i have found my extravagantly excellent restaurant in kabob.....i am a mainline business owner 25 years [REVIEW_8] Great starters with bread; peppers and eggplant.  I went from the Italian servers recommended dish and it was excellent!  Solid service and atmosphere.  All the traditional and no so traditional dishes. [REVIEW_9] Absoulutely loved the ambience of this place! The food was beyond delicious and I was blown away by the dessert. Also; service was very good!! [REVIEW_10] Sat outside for an early dinner before the Kentucky Derby. We had the chicken; ribs and macaroni; and the Brie and crab hand pie. All of it was great; the meat was all tasty and tender. The macaroni was very cheesy and had a hint of black pepper. The hand pie; which is new to the menu; was my personal favorite. You could taste the crab and it came surrounded by a well complimented creamy cocktail sauce. Highly suggest everything we had! [REVIEW_11] As a place super close to the Piazza; it doesn't strike you as a busy place with amazing food. This place has great service; with the bartenders and servers always extremely helpful and personable. The place is even packed on week nights. [REVIEW_12] Do yourself a favor and order up a beef gyro platter. It comes with so much food you could probably feed two; but you're going to want to hoard it all for yourself. Plus you get enough hummus and pita to bath in -- win win. [REVIEW_13] Incredible! Best cinnamon buns I've had in my entire life! Always fresh; and still hot right out of the oven.  Staff are always friendly; and price is reasonable.  I always make sure to grab one whenever I'm at the mall! And the frosting is to die for! [REVIEW_14] Reservations Gourmet- to-Go is often overlooked at as a Seminole Heights eatery but shouldn't be. Reservation offers up a convenient service for those without the time to cook. The kicker is; that if you have been to Reservations you'll crave it even when you have time to cook.  Reservations serves quality home cooked meals to-go and their weekly specials are huge deal for those that are budget conscious.  Not only is Reservations good but they are also locally owned and operated. The owners Anthony and Elke live here in Seminole Heights and make everything from scratch.  One order will usually serve a two people.  We have ordered 2 meals which easily served four people and we still had leftovers.  The order pictured to left included:  Yankee Pot Roast; fork tender beef slowly cooked with carrots; onions; green beans and potatoes for $11.95  Chicken Rustica;  boneless breast saut√©ed with crushed red pepper; garlic; capers; olives; tomato and Romano for $11.95  The Yankee Pot Roast was good but the Chicken Rustica was fantastic (BTW I am a fan of olives) . The mashed potatoes are great and the salad's are above average. Other hits include the Chicken Marsala and the Meatloaf. Reservations also carries vegetarian dishes such as the Polenta Lasagna; polenta layered with portobellos; parmesan; mozzarella and pomodoro sauce.  Reservation's specials change weekly. Make sure you sign up for their e-mail list which is on a clipboard on the front counter.  There is seating at Reservations and its a popular lunch spot for those looking for a great sandwich.  The hot sandwiches are a must try. Topping the hot sandwich list are the Hot Meatloaf Hoagie and the Buffalo Chicken Finger Sub for $7.95 each.  If you want to splurge a little you should try a piece of cake which will cost you $4.50. The Cheese Cake is a hit among neighbors but I have to give my personal recommendation to the Carrot Cake. I am not a fan of carrot cake but the Reservations version kicks ass. [REVIEW_15] If I could give it a zero; I would. I order a plain hamburger; and realized they put  bacon in it (which I am allergic to and unable to eat) after two bites. When I went back to the drive-through window to complain (didn't realize the actual restaurant was open--it was almost 2 after all...); the guy took back the burger; said nothing; and disappeared. After 2 minutes of awkwardly making conversation with the next people in line in their car; he came back and rudely told me I had to go inside to get my food. Which I did. And still did not get an apology.  I refuse to go back there after that ordeal; which is a shame; because it's nice to have a variety of places to go to after DT. Guess Freebirds it is!,12
17,"[REVIEW_1] I had a great experience last oil change. It was back in September but it was great! The techs were friendly and efficient! They sent a letter thanking me for coming in and included a $10 coupon! I will definitely be back! [REVIEW_2] Service sucks big time and the manager is downright nasty; but I must say their soups and coffee are good [REVIEW_3] i wish i could have given it a zero or a negative.  my first and last experience was not pleasant at all. i ordered the tabbouleh and hummus platter when it came imagine my surprise to find the tabbouleh was about 96% parsley.  i kept looking for the bulgur wheat and there was literally none to speak of.  when i brought this to the attention of the staff i was blown off and treated as if i did not know what i was talking about.  i then asked for a to go and forgot it when i left.  i came back in under three minutes and it had been tossed already.  the next time i want mediterranean food i will support a local mediterranean restaurant that is owned and operated by mediterraneans.  this is poorly prepared fast food in a semi pretty package. [REVIEW_4] It is unfortunate that with such a unique location and such a brand and product offering this specific store offers such lousy service. The wait is endless; no one is available to help and at Christmas time getting a gift wrap is act of God that requires endless wait. I bought gifts and knew that the wait for wrapping would be long SO I even left my items at the store to be gift wrapped at their leisure. They were not even moved from the counter where I bought them when I returned almost two hours later ready for pick up. This was a gift that needed to be given and The staff COMPLETELY ""dropped the ball"" on my time constraints!   I love their stuff; but today was my last shopping experience at this location: couldn't get a gift wrapped after being assured that it could be done in a timely fashion???  I'll  cancel my card; do everything online and try not to go there if I can. It's really a shame! [REVIEW_5] I recently bought $50 worth of hair products I was specifically looking for.  While I looked three salespeople were in a conversation a few aisles away.  When I was walking toward the cashier; one asked if I needed any help.  Yes about ten minutes ago!  The first thing the cashier asked me was; ""What's your phone number?""  Really?  No ""hello""; have you found everything you were looking for?""  I responded it was unlisted. She looked panicked and told me it didn't go anywhere.  Then why ask?  She then asked me if I had a daughter?  I could give her phone number.  OMG; totally inappropriate question.  Besides if I'm not giving you my phone number why would I give you my daughter's she assumed I had?  I told her I don't give out personal information.    I most likely will continue shopping there; but please stop this policy of asking customers for their phone numbers!! [REVIEW_6] Drove past this place recently and I think it's closed .;.............................................................................. ..............................................;........................... [REVIEW_7] Went to this store for an alignment;  when I parked the mechanics were just sitting with no work to do. At 8:30 this is not a good sing for the shop. They checked my vehicle and then notified me at I needed approx $1500.00 in repairs. They even said things that were just replaced needed to be replaced. Drove to my normal mechanic and only needed 2 parts for about 1/6 of the price.  Would not go to this place again. [REVIEW_8] Rude and impatient while going through the drive thru. It was an inconvenience to ask Monica any kind of question. Won't be back. If you don't like your job work somewhere else. [REVIEW_9] We tried to stop in and wait for a table for the second night in a row. The hostess was utterly useless. She refused to tell us how many tables were in front of us; rough estimate of how long it would be (other than a while); and wouldn't tell us how long a to go order would be. There were empty tables everywhere so I didn't understand why there was such a long wait.   Since we did eat there the night before and we were trying to go back; the food was good. Best cheesecake my fianc√© ever had. My steak was cooked well and flavorful. My baked potato was cold when it came out. Bread was yummy. But the service sucks so bad; I wouldn't recommend it. [REVIEW_10] Horrible buffet; they don't have enough toppings.. you have to wait for the pizza.. not recommend it for one hr. Lunch.. [REVIEW_11] Terrible Service! I went there with a co worker around 5pm to get drinks using a giftcard I got from RiteAid.com. I've been there a couple times because their chicken fingers are delicious! When I got there; I told the bartender that I had 2 /$10 coupons(only because it didnt allow me to buy $20); she said I could only use one coupon per month. So I said 'okay well then we'll just be getting some drinks.'  She never said anyrhing else. So when we get the bill; the owner came over and told me to never come back!! All because we didnt order food and he thought I was scamming him!! (If she said we had to buy food then we would have) Then said shouted that doesn't support alcoholism! (But owns a bar) I can't believe because I had 3 beers after work on a Monday; I'm considered an alcoholic! The bill was about $18 and I was going to give a good tip but.... I'm never going back. Just like another review I saw for this place- ""These people judge a book by its cover."" If you don't want people to use the coupons!! don't offer to be on the website!!. It's simple. Such bad business! [REVIEW_12] This place is atrocious. The food made me sick. My boyfriend and I got the sushi for two and nothing was fresh. At all. The service was even worse. The guy refused to split our check. So bad; we went to chick-fil-a after. Overall; do not come here unless you want to live in the bathroom for the night. [REVIEW_13] The beignets were so bad that we didn't even eat them. They tasted like fried shrimp and were tough as well. The pralines were gritty; but tasty. Also; the computer/register was down so no drinks available from the bar. We offered to pay cash; but this was beyond their capacity and the request was met with silence. The courtyard was lovely though and the staff courteous. But it was such a disappointment on our first stop of our first day to New Orleans. [REVIEW_14] I have to disagree with any of the negative posts listed. I loved this place and was wanting go back as soon as I left. I had the Grilled Chicken Pesto wrap and it was perfect; I ordered a side of hummus for an extra $2 maybe and it too was excellent. The chips felt homemade and were extra crispy; perfect for scooping sauces or dips. I thought the restaurant itself was very clean and especially nice for a quick sit down type of place. The staff was attentive and very helpful and our food came out much quicker than I expected. I will certainly go back and have recommended it to several friends since my first visit. [REVIEW_15] I haven't eaten here in a while because a friend of mines quit; due to rude employers. But I was just starving. I went to order an omelette with the veggies wrapped inside instead of cooked in. I was told that I could not have it that way. Once I asked why??? Both cashiers snapped at me and told me that the cook had the right to make it however he pleased and couldn't I see how busy they were. And they didn't have anytime to special make my order.... After a verbal argument between me and the staff the had to nerve to ask if I still wanted to order. This place has good food but very very poor customer service skills. I will never spend my money there ever again... The worst service I have ever received.",2
18,"[REVIEW_1] Dr. Poblete is the best doctor that I have ever interacted with. Every visit; we spend the majority of our appointment with her face-to-face. No time waiting in the waiting room. She is careful to help us schedule appointments for our baby when toddlers won't be in the office for her health. She answers the office phone line at any time; takes time to talk with us about any concerns (even if we are being overzealous). Then she calls back later to make sure we are still okay.  She is very descriptive in all of her explanations and has a wonderful disposition. Everyone's child deserves care like this. [REVIEW_2] They offer lunch and dinner combos. Great prices. Food was ok. They play uncensored rap music through out the restaurant. No biggie I like that. Service was a D+.   Ethics...  I rated 1 star because I bought a restaurant.com gift card and was not able to use on the lunch combos. They call them ""specials"" (restaurant.com certificate not good towards specials) thus not able to get the ""everyday combos"". After factoring that I had to pay full price vs their combo price; it was pointless to use the gift card. I saved $3 vs the $15 value on the card. (Lost the $3 considering gas cost driving from Brandon in search for a good sushi joint)  Dear Sake House; you lost me forever over this combined with poor service. Maybe I'm being too critical but I for sure will never; ever be back. Specials should be specials not every day values on your standard menu. Especially if you are selling restaurant.com gift cards!!!!!!! [REVIEW_3] Pucketts is really a great Southern restaurant. You'll get friendly service and so many great food and drink options. My personal favorite meal; so far; is the Smoked Meatloaf. This is not anything like Mama's meatloaf. It is a combo of their brisket and pulled pork. I love that the topping is not too sweet. It's so good... makes it difficult to try other dishes. But; you may also want to try a burger with the pimento cheese....Yum! They have great seasonal cocktails; and my current favorite is the Honey; I'm Home. It tastes like the perfect light summer drink. Their weekend live music is always great as well! Great food; great people! [REVIEW_4] Freaky fast is a joke here.  It regularly takes over a hour to receive a lunch delivery from this location.  After three instances of this I am done.  I will not order from this location again. [REVIEW_5] Went here on a Friday night awkward because no system for how to get a table. The margarita I had was really weak. Asked for extra limes and never got any. The chicken tacos are incredibly bland. Literally chicken and salsa verde nothing else; which would normally be okay; but the chicken didn't have any taste. Got charged $2 for a little cheese to put on my taco for taste. Ambience was cool and different; but everything else gets a thumbs down. Service was marginal at best. My friends had their orders messed up. First and last time coming. [REVIEW_6] Total Wine & More is much; much better. I don't this this BevMo location will be open much longer. There are probably a maximum of 2 employees working here at any given time. Most of of their inventory is out of date and overpriced by a wide margin.  No wonder this place is so empty. [REVIEW_7] Staff is amazing here.  So helpful and supportive when we stayed in 2015.  They knew we had a lot of stuff to load in our car; plus two little kids; so they let us take our time.  We were way past the checkout hour by the time we left; lol!  Hotel room was always clean; house keeping always prompt.   They left the room neat as a pin.  The breakfast had a lot of variety; including beverages.  The breakfast area was nice to sit and relax in.  The hotel itself is beautiful.  You could tell the staff paid attention to cleanliness and detail.  Only thing I was kind of put off by was that the bathroom and shower room didn't have locks; but that was a minor issue.  I don't give five stars easily; lol; so I would definitely recommend this hotel! [REVIEW_8] There's a reason why they're # 1:  They're the Best!  My daughter [a UCSB student] needed a short-term public storage unit because her new apartment wasn't available to move-in; before the lease of her old place expired.  So; I researched online for some local businesses.  Only Public Storage is up front about what they charge for their storage units and their website is user-friendly.  Others claim they have competitive prices; but what does that really mean?  Why don't they all clearly list their price for a particular size unit and tell you if it is available or not; without subjecting you to a sales pitch.  I inquired via their website; but they didn't have the courtesy to reply.  Public Storage was also the closest place to her Apt.; UCSB; and offered the best deal too.  With their ""$1 for the 1st month promo"" it was a no-brainer decision.  Public Storage has got their act together and are very professional.  Does the competition allow you to reserve a unit without making a deposit?  Before I was finished registering online for their ""Express Check-In"" during the reservation process; their manager Kristine called to welcome me and answer any question that I might have.  That's impressive.  They also sent a written confirmation restating the size of the unit; your preference [of indoor vs. drive-up access]; the cost; and your move-in date.   When we were ready to move into the unit; Manny was our on-site team member; and he made the process hassle-free.  It was ready; and I had a choice of several that were available.  F.Y.I.; if you want to keep a mattress clean; then buy one of their giant plastic storage bags.  Their office is well stocked with essential supplies and padlocks too; if you didn't have one already.  Moving out was just as easy; if not easier.  We came when it was convenient for us and left the unit clean and unlocked overnight.  I notified Public Storage online of our move-out.  They inspected the unit; closed out our account; and sent me a receipt.  [I didn't even need to re-visit the place; but did since I was in the area a few days later.  I just wanted to tell Kristine and Henry; who greeted me; what a pleasure it was doing business with them.  I would highly recommend Public Storage and would without hesitation; re-use them again; if the need arises. [REVIEW_9] Awful noise and constant interruptions by staff to ask how things are going.  Ridiculous dancing. Etc. never again...goy a headache in about 10 minutes! [REVIEW_10] What can I say...the steaks are awesome...especially the coffee rubbed fillet...the prices could come down a little though; but still one of the best steaks out there.  I would go here any day over Conors; Bones; Ruth Chris; etc. [REVIEW_11] They moved to 1515 DeKalb. The office is GORGEOUS! They have heated massage dental chairs and tvs on the ceiling. Love it! Staff is awesome! [REVIEW_12] This place has gone downhill in a hurry.  When it first opened; the donuts were actually good and had creative toppings.  Now they have creative topping but the actual donuts don't taste fresh.  They have opened up a few locations and now the quality at the original location isn't there. [REVIEW_13] Soo disappointed. Ordered delivery and specified that it was from a hotel. They brought no utensils and told them I did not specify them. They changed my order without asking me. The kicker was that the Biryani I ordered had hard things in it; some of which were whole cardamon pods but also (and yuck) a partially eaten stone fruit. Please don't get delivery. If anything eat there; but I will not [REVIEW_14] Punctual; professional; meticulous about keeping our home clean during the sweeping of our chimney.  Took the time to explain the different types of hazards that could occur and were very considerate when asked to check the outside air vent to the fireplace. They removed a bird nest and did so without asking for asking for additional compensation.  First class service.  I can see why they've been in business so long. [REVIEW_15] I will forever be disappointed as to how ""un-outlet"" this place truly is. Although; I've given this store EVERY opportunity when I've been in the market for new appliances; I have NEVER found this outlet to serve my needs and my budget accordingly nor honestly.  The pricing is foolish. For example; two identical refrigerators; one marked ""returned"" and one clearly damaged were priced exactly the same as the NEW unit I saw in Sears proper at the Deptford Mall three days prior. The posted ""Yellow Tag Clearance Event"" is fraudulent.  I can only surmise that people that do buy here are just lazy. Perception of value is more important than reality in retail. So be it. After nearly 10 attempts to shop here; I am done.",7
19,"[REVIEW_1] Super Fun place that we happened on by chance during our weekend child free get-a-way.  This place made me wish I had brought my kids along.  It is a great family spot with really amazingly good food!  We will be back! [REVIEW_2] I am thoroughly impressed with Diva! The whole group of salon professionals are very good- starting with Tina! They will bend over backwards to make you happy and fit you in as they are always busy! Prices are good! [REVIEW_3] I moved from Chicago to Philadelphia over a year ago.  Everybody here raves about the restaurants; but I have yet to find many that deserve five stars; or even four.  This is the best restaurant I have eaten in in Philadelphia.    Tahini and bread  arrived at the table; and I thought; hum; plain but I'm hungry.  They must put crack in that Tahini.  I wanted to lap it out of the bowl like an uncouth dog.  The bread is excellent too.  I love a menu with many organic meat choices.  How often can you order an organic beef shishkabob?  It was superb.  The meat done perfectly; the onions nearly caramelized but not quite so they still had some substantive crunch.  The purslane salad tasted like I was eating a plant in the middle of a garden.  It is not often that I dream about a salad but I do dream about this one  My husband had a chicken dish with black eyed peas and green peas and fantastic rice.  I won't begin to describe the flavoring; it is beyond my culinary vocabulary.  We asked what spices they use; and in addition to traditional zatar; they use their own blend of spices.  I don't even need to know what is in it just so long as we can keep coming back and ordering it again and again.  I was so full but ate dessert none the less; which I usually don't do.  But when a diner is this good; I had a feeling the desserts would be too and I just needed to find out.  Pistachio creme brulee.  It could have come out over the top; but no indeed.  It was pure pistachio heaven in s super light yet rich custard.  Heaven. Heaven.  Our service was superb.  The squeezed us into a last minute Friday night reservation with the caveat that we would need to get through our dinner in an hour and 15 minutes in order to accommodate a reservation made prior to us.  Given the time constraints they never made us feel rushed and timed the meal perfectly.  Then my husband left to go to the restroom; the waiter picked up his napkin and refolded it nicely on the table.  Do I care about the napkin placement in the middle of a meal?  Not really; but it is a sign that the waitstaff is incredibly attentive and extremely well trained.    My eating out plan for Philly might just be to skip eating most everywhere most of the time so I can frequent this expensive; though appropriately priced restaurant.  Kudos to the chef. [REVIEW_4] Best pizza I have ever had! Delivery is always so fast; never waited longer that 45 minutes ! I Highly recommend this restaurant! Prices are great as well! [REVIEW_5] Found this place strictly because of Yelp. Fantastic breakfast. I had the hash mountain which truly is a mountain and delicious. My father in-law got the french toast and his exact words were; ""This may be the best french toast I've ever had"". Kids enjoyed their meals. Especially the sausage. Nice big links; not those teeny little ""Johnsonville"" store bought sausages. Service is a bit slow but in my opinion that's part of the ambiance. It feels and taste's like your over at your grandmother's house for breakfast. Why rush it? We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and I'll definitely be back to try the lunch menu. Thanks Yelpers!!! [REVIEW_6] I purched a bed 6 months ago. It IS STILL ON THE SHOW ROOM FLOOR. It has collapsed SEVERAL times.  Now I purchased their warranty; "" someone will come out with no question and replace your furniture"". That's a lie. I went into ashley to see what I should do about this on January 22nd. They put in for a service technician to call me. 2-24-16 i spoke to someone and explained that my bed was collapsing with any movement. Without sending someone out to look at it...they sent me new rails. 3-4-16 i received the rails in the mail. 3-7-16 i called for a tech to put these rails on. They out out a ticket and said i would get a call in 24-28 hours. 3-10-16 technician called and scheduled me for their first available appointment 03-17-16. I made it known that I WOULD NOT be available until after 5pm. 3-16-16 I received a confirmation call IN SPANISH confirming my appointment date and time. I DONT SPEAK SPANISH! I called them back after work requesting someone call me back that next morning and give me the information in English. No one called 3-17-16 I called the tech company again around 10am and they said someone would be out between 11am-2  . I reminded them that I told them I am not available until after 5pm. And canceled this appointment and refused to reschedule. I GAVE GOTTEN NOTHING BUT A RUN AROUND. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM HERE! [REVIEW_7] Great food at a great value! My favorite items on the menu are the Pho; Pork Bun; Bahn Mi; and the pot stickers are delicious!The Bahn Mi comes on true French bread (I recommend the pork belly). As for Pho; I usually get the beef with extra bean sprouts. Pork Bun is my favorite menu item; it comes with vermicelli noodles; cucumber; carrots; and more. The best server there her name is Tim. Ask for her if you want to get the best service! [REVIEW_8] The worst Chicken Parm. Sandwich I've ever eaten. The chicken was dry and flavorless...I have a feeling it was not made that day. They put a ton of red sauce over it (no garlic; very little seasoning ); and small piece of cheese that was barely melted.  I took a few bites because I was hungry and threw the rest out; glad I only got the 6 inch. Would never go back there....blech !!! [REVIEW_9] Incredible! Best cinnamon buns I've had in my entire life! Always fresh; and still hot right out of the oven.  Staff are always friendly; and price is reasonable.  I always make sure to grab one whenever I'm at the mall! And the frosting is to die for! [REVIEW_10] Love their pizza; lunch time salad bar deal is a great value. Take my wife there once a week for lunch. Family atmosphere; back bar; game room but to me the best part is the pizza! They also have rojo potatoes; an old tradition from the old Shakeys era. Friendly people work there; worth checking out! [REVIEW_11] Amazing Bakery! As you walk in; you get a draft of fresh baked bread! One of the best Guatemalan Bakeries within California and Nevada. I recommend you also try the tamales! [REVIEW_12] So I hadn't been to Pita Jungle in a long time and was craving hummus. I wasn't really sure what I wanted besides that. But I have to give a shout out to Kirsten behind the bar who was AWESOME!!! She sat and talked to me like an old friend and went into detail about all the dishes I was thinking about.  The food was amazing; the service was tremendous and Kirsten knows how to make people feel at home. I'll definitely be back again! [REVIEW_13] Oh man! This is the spot right here! Everything is made to order and sooo worth the wait. I'm from Chicago and have been a self proclaimed sandwich expert for most of my life...this place deserves every bit of those 5 stars! Well done guys! [REVIEW_14] Ordered the coconut curry ramen and it was so delicious. The broth was extremely flavorful; and savory. Party in my mouth! [REVIEW_15] The BEST hotdogs around! No lie! I used to say down town LA or pinks Hotdogs were the best! But nope!  Daves dogs are BOMB! Plus he has something different on his (secret menu) every week!  Staff is really nice! I go at least once a week!",13
20,"[REVIEW_1] We live in the neighborhood and have eaten here many times. I feel as if this restaurant is going downhill. This time we were there for dinner early on a Sunday. The bathrooms were filthy. There are 2 and one was not usable due to all of the paper towels that had been put into the toilet (there was no toilet paper). The other one was usable but also no toilet paper. Our server; Ashley; was not interested in providing any semblance of customer service...RUDE! We had a simple question about the beers on special and she became quite defensive. My daughter spilled her drink; which I realize is a pain in the ass for the restaurant and server (although we were outside so it wasn't that big a deal). We apologized profusely but she didn't even try to hide her annoyance. Finally; the chicken quesadilla should have been labeled the gristle quesadilla....more fat than actual meat...yuck. We love the proximity of this place to where we live and it was great in the past but not anymore...will likely not return...not with so many better quality restaurants in Northern Liberties and Fishtown. [REVIEW_2] Couldn't have asked for a better location but horrible maid service and not worth the price. Horrible communication between the staff. The room was nice but didn't include a mini fridge or blow drier. The wi-fi was also a problem. It stopped working and when I asked the front desk about it they told me to call a number.... Which I was on hold for too long with. The pool was heated and had a nice view but one night was hot tub hot and the next was luke warm. Wouldn't recommend this hotel. [REVIEW_3] Best restaurant in St Pete hands down. Probably the best in the Tampa Bay area. You have to try the Gambas Ajillo! [REVIEW_4] I stopped here because it was by the hotel I was staying in. The guys working at the shop were super nice and friendly. I really like the buy one get one deal they do. I also ordered some hot wings and they were pretty good. They had a ton of sauce on them which is awesome. Next time I come back to town I will be sure to stop here for some more pizza! [REVIEW_5] Best Cuban sandwich in town; and quite possibly the best black bean soup I've ever had. Super friendly service. This is definitely a spot to check out. [REVIEW_6] I absolutely hate coming here to pick up a package. It's difficult to locate and they have terrible service. They are not even set up for customer traffic at all! And I only came here because it's impossible to set up a convenient time for a package delivery at my home. [REVIEW_7] I was in town on a business trip. This is a cool; fun; dive bar bar. No matter how you describe it; I had fun and so did everyone else. We sat at the bar and had no issues with empty glasses or bottles. Great service; drink specials and friendly locals. The place is big and they do serve food; however we did not eat here. Also plenty of pool tables; decent outside patio. Great place to stop by and enjoy some beverages and meet some local folks. [REVIEW_8] This is the worst Hertz location. I rent a car once or twice a week for work and have been to a lot of Hertz locations. The customer service is poor; the car pick up location is inconvenient and the cars never have a full tank of gas. Let me share with you some lessons learned; which the Hertz people should tell you but don't:  1. Before you leave the rental counter; make sure you have a parking ticket to exit the garage. 2. I have never rented a car from this location with a full tank of gas. They tell you it has a ""little less than full"". How the heck do you return a car ""a little less than full""? I always end up filling up the tank for them because I don't know when to stop pumping.  3. The cars used to be in the downstairs garage of 30th St station. Not anymore.  Go out the rental office and make a right; up the ramp until you find the escalator. Take escalator up. Walk across the overpass and take the escalators down. Leave the building and cross the walkway to the rental cars; which are outdoors. So; if it is raining or snowing; good luck. 4. Take parking ticket from lesson 1 to exit the parking area. 5. Upon return; just park in any spot and bring your keys back to the rental counter (back into the building; up the escalator; across the overpass; down the escalator; across the length of the station) to return the keys. Don't expect a verbal confirmation of your total; don't expect a smile or someone wishing you a good day. Just walk away vowing to take a cab the next time. [REVIEW_9] Chicken was salty; I ordered 1/2 chicken; rice and plantains to go for lunch. With the chicken and rice; I only received 2 pieces of plantains & paid I've $8 for this meal. Totally not worth it. There were great reviews but it was not my day. I will have to think twice before ordering from here again. [REVIEW_10] This has been an awful experience. We walked in around 1:30 pm and we waited for our drinks for 40 minutes and had to remind the waiter three times. Half of our table received their meals while the other half had to wait an extra 20 minutes. There were two tables here and a few at the bar; not busy at all. The table behind us walked out due to the awful service; and I'm currently wondering why I didn't. never going back [REVIEW_11] Every time I go there the service is terrible nd today they didn't have anything except pulled port. Terrible service and terrible management [REVIEW_12] I recently moved to the STL area from Denver and have tried several different teachers -- I can say that Danielle; the owner of D's; is far and away my favorite.  Danielle has a wonderful understanding of alignment and sequencing. Her verbal cues were clear and I felt like I learned a lot during just one class. I really appreciated that she did a lot of hands on adjustments because it kept me feeling safe in the poses. Her transitions between poses and sets were really creative and kept me engaged.    Overall; I walked away feeling sweaty and sore in a good way. All the students in the class seemed really comfortable with her and she made an effort to talk to me as a new student. I will definitely be back and look forward to her classes. [REVIEW_13] This is probably my favorite trap and skeet club in the entire United States. Top-notch facilities; and top-of-the-line instruction from Tim Miles of Coyote Springs (he's the best in the business). Call Tim today and arrange for a lesson. You won't be sorry. [REVIEW_14] uhm awesomely WING-ASMIC!!! [REVIEW_15] FUCKING AMAZING! Quite a surprise and hidden away. If you like retro design and tiki drinks this bar is great. I had no issues with the service... If you are dying for a drink  then just walk up to the bar; dummy.",8
21,[REVIEW_1] I have been here twice. They just opened about 3 weeks ago. Our food and service was good and I hope they stick around! BYOB The soups are delicious especially the #1 soup w the seafood.  Very friendly staff.  They need to have their sign out up out front!  They are tucked away on the side of the shopping complex and easy to miss. [REVIEW_2] Best nail salon. Only place that puts up with my particularity. Chris always makes sure that my nails look perfect. They also do a great pedicure. Finally found my nail salon since moving up here. [REVIEW_3] A very simple and very casual Nashville staple sits across from Vanderbilt University on 21st Ave.; South. The food is phenomenally basic but completely predictable. it's the atmosphere that you are coming for and that's the five star experience. Service with a smile.  Get a bucket of reasonably priced beer and some tacos or chips and sit outside. As so much has changed in the surrounding area this place remains a true neighborhood constant. Obviously better to enjoy in the nicer weather as eating indoors just doesn't have the same appeal as the outdoor opportunity.   Heads-up-- parking  is almost nonexistent but you can try The neighborhood or simply walk or Uber from your hotel. [REVIEW_4] Thai Fusion is hands down the best Thai food I've ever had - and it's just right around the corner from my house! The service is excellent and the staff is incredibly friendly which definitely bumps them to the 5-star rating. [REVIEW_5] I love coming here to do my smog on my cars great service and chipper then most!!! I totally recommend this place. [REVIEW_6] This is my first choice whenever we decide to go out to dinner! They have a huge selection of foods that will fit any type of person who will be dining there. Their staff is super nice and will accommodate to whatever your needs may be! The restaurant itself is beautiful and very relaxing. In my opinion; Fellinis of media has the best Italian cuisine around. [REVIEW_7] Never disappointed at Maynards. Outstanding Arizona wines. The celery bisque and bistro salad made for excellent appetizers. As main dishes we had trout and swordfish respectively. The fish was exquisitely prepared; leaving its inherent flavor come through; not smothering it in sides. To top it off; an outstanding peach budino. Attentive prompt service. Great experience. [REVIEW_8] My family has been going here for years and loves it. They have wonderful bread and a salad that is to die for. Also; fettucini is yummy as well and chicken parmigiana. Also love their cappuccino freeze dessert. Please go! Yum [REVIEW_9] Amazing fresh authentic food. My favorite beef pie. You have to stop by and try this place. You won't regret it. [REVIEW_10] Came here on a whim after just moving here 6 weeks ago. Absolutely loved it! The service was stellar. The food was good (nothing to write home about); but overall a great experience. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who anyone looking for a casual meal and a good time. I look forward to returning for more happy hour specials and even the occasional live music show. [REVIEW_11] I LOVE this place. Best veggie burger in town (handmade patty!!)! And the pretzel buns?? YUM. [REVIEW_12] Seeing as though this restaurant was directly across the street from our hotel; we opted for convenience; and safety (as it was Bayou Classic weekend).  Luckily; having no reservations; we were immediately seated. Our servers were great; and had excellent product knowledge. I was sold on a Blantons; and the Wife went with some vodka concoction; that was also excellent. For a starter; we went with the seafood gumbo. Amazing.  For our entrees; the Wife had a white fish; with crab meat; and I went with the shrimp and grits. We scarfed down these entrees like starving Ethiopians. The food was really that good. As far as my shrimp and grits; it was; by far; the best I've ever had.  Perfect food; excellent drinks; and great service. I can't wait to try a John Besh restaurant again. [REVIEW_13] I booked an appointment with Rebecca online - Not knowing what to expect when I arrived to this new salon. Everyone at Halo Hair was wonderful! The ladies who run the place are very warm. My haircut and color went great. Their prices are fair. Definitely coming back! Rebecca was very nice to talk to and work with. [REVIEW_14] We love Mamma Maria's!  The aroma of garlic is enjoyable & makes you anticipate the delights in store when you enter the restaurant.   We started out with a very friendly server who took our drink orders and appetizer order & told us about the soup of the day. Her name was Tracey. She promptly delivered our drinks and let us know that Kristen would be taking over serving.    A very courteous gesture in my opinion.   Kristen was bubbly; friendly & very attentive.    Now for the food; the calamari fritta was delicious and lightly battered. This was tender and had a delicious flavor; served with a chunky flavorful marinara and juicy lemon wedges. The white pizza was delicious and mouthwatering. The crust crispy and the abundant flavor of the roasted garlic was a delight! Always delicious and always consistent.  Looks like they have a tempting selection of desserts; but I showed some discipline and didn't indulge. [REVIEW_15] Love that the Owner is there and takes pride in his work. He has been in business for over 20 years and always gives the best work and price!,15
22,"[REVIEW_1] If you are thinking of staying here for a wedding night; DO NOT!! I have stayed at many other Embassy Suites over the years and have always had a great stay. This happened to be a very different stay. From the check in when my daughter told them it was her wedding weekend and the response was ""Oh"". The housekeeping staff never cleaned the room so the wedding night was an unmade bed with no clean towels. Bellman never showed up to help with bags so the wedding party all dressed in long dresses had to handle the cart and take care of the brides dress. The whole experience from each department failed. Valet was slow and they weren't about to help with the bags or help anyone into the car until $20 came out. We were late to the wedding because of the staffs inadequacies. Stay at the Marriot across the street. They are more accommodating. [REVIEW_2] I had a little Happy Hour dinner here with my girls after work. Great location; right down the street from Rosalita's. I arrived early and got a table for the four of us. Our waitress was awesome; very welcoming and knowledgeable. I started off with the red pepper and gouda soup- just as wonderful as it sounds. Plenty of substance; not overly cheesy - very filling for a soup. Everyone else got one of the signature martini's. Everyone loved them; except two people with the same martini complained their drinks were dissimilar; and the waitress and bartender quickly corrected it; no problem. They have small plates there; which aren't my thing; but the one person in my party who got one liked it.  There was a fish special that looked and apparently tasted delicious. At the end; we each got desserts.   This is definitely a dessert bar- the portions were huge. I seriously thought they brought me two. I ordered a blondie; and received a large brownie AND a nice portion of ice cream- I was in heaven; just as delicious as it looked.   Great service; great food; great dessert. All I need.   On another note; I love that they had several areas; a bar; an area with tables by the window; and two sections with more personal seating; sofas and comfy chairs in the back. Really something for everyone; except for people expecting big burgers... [REVIEW_3] As a property manger I have used Alpine consistently for the last 4 almost 5 years for my re-keys and lock outs.  The quality and  continuity of their service is unparalleled.  I probably should admit this but after locking my keys in my car at a showing at the back of Cold Springs....on a Friday late in the afternoon the guys at Alpine came to my rescue.  I cant imagine using another locksmith.  They are great with my clients and exhibit professionalism beyond compare at evictions.  They are  my go to and will remain such for years to come. [REVIEW_4] Ok; only 8 taps; but they support AZ beer! All 8 are AZ beers!  Great service; and the location is in the Beer Triangle!  WOB is next door; Club Congress is across the street; and Borderlands is a short walk away! Also Barrio is a short and I mean short drive away! Great place; cozy atmosphere and great beer! [REVIEW_5] I have tried all the big named and $$$ dry cleaners around the Carrollwood area and this small place outshines them all. Good pricing and they actually listen to you when you request No Starch please! Very friendly and open from 8-7 daily. [REVIEW_6] I've been coming to Linda at Venus experience for two years now and I hate going anywhere else. She is so thorough and quick that I forget I'm getting a Brazilian. Cheap efficient and relatively painless go Linda! [REVIEW_7] This place is wonderful! We found it today while looking for dedicated Gluten Free restaurants. The bakery is ran by a friendly; hard-working mother who's autistic son works there as well; and they only employ individuals on the spectrum.  The items were all great. None of the foods tasted any less as gluten free; casein free desserts. The cookie dough chocolate cupcake was especially good. I really like that they have interesting options too; like jalape√±o strawberry bread; and the owner said they are coming up with new ideas each week and letting people vote on them on social media.  The owner went out of her way to be kind. She realized that our toddler is also on the spectrum; and she invited her to help water plants out front. The workers were perfectly accommodating and not phased by our daughter throwing a tantrum on the floor.  They definitely seem supportive of the community. I saw that their artwork on the wall is only from individuals with mental disabilities. They sell autism shirts there as well. Definitely a great place for the community! [REVIEW_8] How can something so simple become so hard?   Ducked into Mr. B's for a quick lunch at the bar. I ordered a Mr. B's luncheon salad (dressing on the side) and a catfish fingers app. The salad came WITH dressing; the overly loquacious bartender was at the far end of the bar; regaling diners there with the tale of his losing another customer's credit card earlier in the day; and despite my efforts; I was unable to get his attention. So; I ate the dressed salad. Twenty minutes later; the bartender finally came by; and asked if I had received the catfish fingers. I had not.  The bartender ducked into the kitchen; came back; and assured me that a fresh order of catfish was being made for me. Waited (in vain) for another 30 minutes. When I had been waiting a total of 50 minutes and had still not received my food; I asked for a check (minus the catfish) and a manager. The manager heard my story and professed to be astounded; and he assured me he was going to investigate in the kitchen as to what went wrong. Then he jumped up and left.  Anytime that I've experienced a restaurant malfunction of this magnitude; I've been offered some measure of hospitality. Neither the bartender nor the manager cared enough to offer me a drink; a dessert; or any other compensation for the time I wasted trying to have a simple lunch. What a supreme disappointment from what I thought was a high caliber operation. [REVIEW_9] The first time I visited the Deli I wanted to order everything off the menu. Our group ordered four different sandwiches; and all were delicious! They were very filling! They also have great blues music! This place was so packed on a Thursday night (no room to sit) so I would suggest getting here very early! I plan on going back; possibly for lunch so I can sit down! GREAT place! [REVIEW_10] Do not order the burgers! The menu laughingly states that they have the best burgers in town: not even close. Burger King has more flavor than these clearly frozen; stale tasting; poorly cooked pucks. Also; you could tell that the appetizers; while properly hot; were food service grade; pre-cooked; frozen concoctions that they then reheated. I cannot speak to other menu items; but I'm not going to waste any more money here. There is no excuse for not serving fresh food. [REVIEW_11] Last week; my husband and I went on the swap tour (it was about 2 hours in length). Our captain was amazing: as a native; he knew just about everything in terms of the habitat and history. Knew all about the wildlife and he made the tour SO fun. Saw tons of gators; and the tour guide caught soft crabs and snails for us to pass around. We were in Nola for 5 days and this was definitely a huge highlight!! [REVIEW_12] When I get massages I care more about the massage itself over the ambiance but I could not resist the opportunity to grab a massage after breakfast here. We managed to get the largest suite for the couples massage that day and I could hardly get myself to leave once the massage was over.   The service amenities are impeccable (true for all services at the Four Seasons) but I was still impressed nonetheless from the entire experience. I was a bit concerned when I met the small-framed woman who was to administer my massage but she did not disappoint; she was strong and knew how to get out out all the knots in my neck; shoulders and back. All the small details made the difference here (i.e. lavender oils); suite decor; etc.  Guests of the hotel receive 20% off hotel services and I highly recommend you budget time before and especially after to hang out in the relaxation lounge on the second floor to have some tea/water/lemonade and soak in the amazing views of the garden and the ocean in the distance. [REVIEW_13] Wow!! AWESOME!! I have always had fast; friendly; reliable service! Take out and delivery no matter what my order is always fresh and delicious. FRESH FRESH FRESH. Always catering to families with their  friendly staff and seating available with an entertainment center so dad can watch the game. They make every effort to make eating at their restaurant the best part of your day. I cannot say more positive things about Seasons of Wayne. [REVIEW_14] Julia was amazing!! She arranged a beautiful floral arrangement for us on Mother's day after finding out that our online order was delayed until May 10. Who knew that we were going to find someone so artistic in the flower department at The Fresh Market.   Well; you heard it first from me because I have been ordering flowers forever from florists and after she put it together she revealed that she had 35 years of experience. I picked out the flowers that I liked and there she went meticulously placing them exactly where they should go.   And BAM! in less than 10 minutes it was done. It was like meeting the ""Flower Whisperer""; no kidding. I'm definitely going to go there every time I need a beautiful arrangement. Next time I'll let her pick out the flowers as well. :) Thanks; Julia! [REVIEW_15] Wish I would have came on Yelp and read the previous reviews; it would've saved me a lot of time and frustration. I ran in today to see if someone could take a look at my right passenger front wheel. My tire pressure light was on and I noticed a piece of tire was lifted. I go in and he tells me it's a couple hours wait. Ok; I'll give you that I just showed up so the wait thing is to be expected. I ask the guy if I can make an appointment to come back. He says its first come first serve. Really? When I've made appts previously with other Just Tires? Why not just say you don't want my service? Bottom line? Guy was rude and lacked any customer service. Went down the street to Mr. Tire and was in and out with a replaced new tire in half an hour. Oh; and they appeared WAY busier based on the waiting area and cars in the garage.",11
23,"[REVIEW_1] Same great food as the other PJ's; just a lot closer! This place isn't as large as some of be others but maybe when their year round deck is it will be. Highly recommend for a game [REVIEW_2] The gentleman in the truck was very nice so he accepted making a fish quesadilla for me although it's not on the menu. It was the best quesadilla I had till this moment to be honest [REVIEW_3] Planet fitness; specifically the one on Murfreesboro Rd in franklin; is fantastic! Being a fitness junkie and having spent many years in every gym known to man; as well as being a personal trainer for about a decade; planet fitness is refreshing. I don't have the same need to go workout for 3 hours a day and stare in the mirror at my progress and compare myself to what I looked like a month ago; and to the other people around me. And Planet Fitness caters to that. It's so clean and well maintained. The staff is super friendly and i truly believe the laid back atmosphere that  encourages you to come do your own thing when it's convenient for you is because of the attitude generated by employees.  The locker rooms are great. Never had a complaint and I LOVE the black card member benefits! [REVIEW_4] Came here with my boyfriend on a trip to NOLA and the food was fantastic! So delicious; the staff kind; an incredible mission. We loved it and can't wait to come back and keep supporting the community. [REVIEW_5] The Steamboat Natchez was excellent! The ride was lengthy and enjoyable and the guide was very informative. We also had access to a lot of the boat and were able to go into the engine room and see how the ship operates. If you are mildly interested in taking a ride on the Mississippi; you won't be disappointed if you ride on Steamboat Natchez. [REVIEW_6] This was by far my favorite Cuban sandwich of all the Cubans I've had to date. We were treated to a free coffee after the meal as well as a spin of the wheel which led to a free dessert. Over all the experience was excellent.  I can't wait to go there again. [REVIEW_7] This is the best Barber shop in the city.   If you've been to Aidan Gil in the last 7 years; chances are you got your hair cut by one of these barbers. Sarah; Nate; and Mike have been delivering the freshest haircuts to Aidan Gil customers for the better part of a decade; and now they have their own shop. They are all great barbers and great people.   The atmosphere is light and fun; it's like you're getting your haircut in your friend's living room. The haircuts are always on point; the fades tight; and the shaves close.   Go in; get a drink; relax and watch some TV while you wait; refill your drink and enjoy your cut/shave. [REVIEW_8] Delicious food and great friendly staff.  Had the half rotisserie with cilantro rice and spicy beans--got the half so I would have leftovers! Everything was delicious and flavorful!  Meat was spiced perfectly and was moist; almost smoked.  Skin was tender and not tough.    The beans (pintos) were full of flavor with a little kick and the cilantro in the rice added a great little fresh note.  Everything came with 2 difference sauces... One was a garlic mustard sauce (called simply ""yellow"" by the waitress) and the other was like a bright green chimchurri.  I could drink both by themselves; but each was amazing with pretty much everything on the plate... including just my spoon. :-)  They gave me extra for my leftovers as well for free; which was nice.  Look forward to coming back here!  Great for a quick lunch. [REVIEW_9] We like the food here very much. Even the house salad is super fresh and delicious. The soups are tasty and full of good spices; vegetables and if desired meat or fish. I've had the Tom Yum with Seafood #51 and it is consistently awesome. You probably have to enjoy Thai cuisine or be open to experimenting to get the most from a visit to Tin's.  If you are into really good Thai food this is a great place to visit. [REVIEW_10] This McDonald's is as terrible as they come. They have no care; mess up every order; take at least 10mins to answer you in drive thru at slow points in the day. Stay away smdh! [REVIEW_11] Holy cow this place is good.  I was in the area and hungry; so of course I turned to Yelp.  I read that other reviewers loved the shrimp tacos - oh my God; they are amazing!  I also tried the taco al pastor and it was great.  Next time; I'll try a burrito; but I'm definitely coming back for more shrimp tacos! [REVIEW_12] I am so done with this franchise.    We had been ordering from them almost weekly since they opened and at first; their pizza was outstanding.  Plenty of toppings; spicy sauce; and a light crunchy crust.  Gradually; however; they declined in quality and quantity.  We quit ordering for many months.  Last weekend; we gave it another try; but it has gotten worse.  Very skimpy toppings and the crust was slightly underdone.  The pizzas in the box looked nothing like the pics on the box.  I'd say our pizzas were equivalent to a $5 hot-n-ready from Little Caesar's; but we paid ~$15 each.  So very; very dissappointed. [REVIEW_13] As good as it gets in a mall food court concept (even an upscale one). The salads and bowls were delicious. The frescas were delicious (the lime; ginger; cucumber one in particular). The service was fast and helpful. I liked how they let you customize the bowls on the menu. We were able to make a bowl that had chicken; vegetarian by adding tofu. Will definitely be back. [REVIEW_14] Very cute place and good food. Pear cider beer was really good the service was really good and great ambiance and the price was very reasonable [REVIEW_15] Great little reward for a great end of the week. Only problem is seating. No outside seating because it's cold outside; but the tasty treats make up for that. The southern carmel cake is my favorite.",13
24,"[REVIEW_1] beware of this hotel!!!!! they just approved a policy of charging customers $50 a night for incidentals!!! if you stay for 5 days thats $250 just for incidentals on top of your nightly charge for your stay! are you kidding me!!!! oh yea; if you don't have a credit card  it's double that; yes $100 a night for incidentals!!!!!!! finally; they don't tell you this till you get there at check-in!!!     ps. yes that includes all you cogic people there for the convention!!! [REVIEW_2] Ok had Sunday lunch with my mother and grandmother here and it was just terrible. Our server didn't even tell us his name and took forever for him to take our drink order. We asked for sweet and low with one of our unsweet teas and didn't receive it. Had to ask for it again to then receive the sweet and low. We ordered the bloomin onion and the chesse fries. The bloomin onion was not the onion the restaurant usually uses because it was on the spicy side. The chesse fires when on the ok side since they did not put much chesse or bacon on the appetizer. So in all reality we ordered a plate of fires with a little chesse and bacon. My grandmother ordered the 6oz steak and it was also on the spicy side. I however ordered the same thing but I ordered mine medium rare but when I got my steak it was rare instead of medium rare and also was really spicy.  We then had to ask for a bottle of steak sauce because if you ask for steak sauce for a party of three you will only get one tiny cup full of steak sauce for the whole table. Had to order a to go order for my father couldn't make it to lunch and our waiter said he would put it in after we had finished our meal. When we finished our food and the waiter gave us our check we still haven't received our to go order. Had to sit and extra five to ten minutes to get that said order. Lets just say we gave a bad tip. Be caution to this place not worth a hundred dollar bill for a spicy mouth and bad experience! [REVIEW_3] All I have to say is that Epcot's Mexico had better tacos than this authentic Mexican joint.  And that's pretty disappointing.  The meat was mildly warm and wasn't seasoned well enough. The beans and rice were bland as well. They were out of steak; so we mistakenly tried pork skin. Imagine eating diced slugs stuffed in a soft tortilla that keeps falling apart. Now pretend that moment in time never happened and you didn't waste your money on something that traumatizing.  Yeah...not as easy as you'd think.  I was really looking forward to the hole-in-the-wall authenticity; but I was sorely lead astray by previous reviews of this place.  Just don't do it. [REVIEW_4] If a customer goes through the trouble of choosing a specific hair style; shares three photographs of someone modeling the exact hairdo; and discusses it at length with the hairdresser; then it should stand to reason that the customer receives that hair style. Not in this case. I must have caught her on a bad day.  Liberty took it upon herself to cut an extra six inches off my curly hair; which I didn't see until the haircut was complete because she had me facing away from the mirror as she worked. When I confronted her about it; she said the girl in the pictures was ""tiny;"" so the hairdo wouldn't look good on me. I regret paying for this abomination; much less leaving a tip. [REVIEW_5] One of the worst customer service I have ever experienced at any Toyota service center! Twice in the past half year; I have had very poor customer service here. The first time was when I bought my car in specifically asking for an inspection of my right front tire; informing them it had been leaking air a few days ago and I had to pull over to get air pumped in. They found nothing... only 2 days later; that same tire went completely flat. I took my car to a local auto shop; and they found a huge nail stuck in the tire that would've been found if Toyota had done a careful inspection the first time.  Second experience was even worse and more shocking. I took my car in for servicing on a Saturday morning. The service person could not answer many of my questions; and when he stated that he was new; I kindly asked him how long he'd been working there (thinking that if he was so new that he didn't know a lot of info; that I'd ask another representative to help me). Out of nowhere; he yelled out in an extremely rude and angry manner;  ""That's none of your business ! ... I won't have you harrassing me..."" Everyone in the room was startled and turned around to see why he was shouting so loudly.  Perhaps he acted this way because there was no manager on duty; however; this behavior is customer service at its worst. As a person in the service industry myself (I am a physician and my patients' health; safety and satisfaction come first); I am shocked by his blatantly inappropriate and unacceptable behavior. This behavior reflects poorly on his company; and I hope nothing like this happens to any other customers in the future. I went to another shop to have my car serviced; where customers would be treated more politely and with respect. [REVIEW_6] I didn't enjoy my experience at Clayton nails today 7/3/2015. It was all because of the nail tech; i didn't get her name but she was young; Vietnamese with a med length bob haircut. I went in for a gel color polish change. Her work is not as neat as what im use to there. She for some reason placed two scolding hot towels over each of my hands while removing the old color. I told her that the towels were too hot and she than removed them and swung them in the air to cool off than reapplied. She than asked 'is this better princess "".  Than she turned around and ask if that woke me up. I've had a gel polish color change several times before; no one has ever placed hot towels on my hands EVER;  i don't know why she did. After the gel color polish was applied and dry she repeatedly reapplied a top thick coat over and over. I kept having to place my hands under the uv light again; thats never happened before either. I guess i have to pick one person to go to and stick to them religiously. [REVIEW_7] At their previous location; I tried Phat Bites. It was dirty and gross. I literally saw the guy mixing a potato salad with his bare hands and then wipe his nose to return to mixing.   Years later; at their new location; I decided to give them another chance. I will concede they said they have a new cook this morning; but my oh my; the food was so bland and undercooked and just overall gross. It's bad enough that the environment is reminiscent of a garage sale turned restaurant - where the items were kept in their original condition by failing to clean them. But on top of that; it's just overall dirty.   Now; the icing on this dirty cake; is that the servers (if you can call them that) are not kind. They are unaware of the menu; they act like it's a burden to help. They need training. One guy was way more concerned with air drumming than attending to my drink order.   It's a bunch of young people; poorly trained; making gross food; in a dirty environment; where they're too cheap to provide real silverware or even a salt shaker. And WAY OVERPRICED. I got to pay $50 for my crap experience.   Seriously; let this place be overtaken by the mold that's likely growing in the corner of the room.   Thank you.   I will never return to this place again. [REVIEW_8] Casinos are just lame.  Ate at the ""International Buffet""; which was pretty standard.  ALthough...they did have real horseradish for the prime rib....nice bonus.  The only  time I come here is to see a concert at the AVA amphitheater.  Otherwise...I would skip it. [REVIEW_9] I have heard tons of good feedback from people about this restaurant and have planned to go eat there because of it. But i feel a bit disappointed in their customer service; i had been calling for a week for their catering services and no one ever called or texted me like they said; they didn't have prices to offer and only one person apparently does their catering quotes. If you offer catering and want to gain profit you should have something set. I ended up having to get a diff person to do it but was looking forward to their tacos. A bit bummed; maybe in the future i might eat there but I'm dissatisfied in my service as a potential client. [REVIEW_10] If I could give them 0 stars I would. Horrible customer service. I order my coffee as follows; cold brew; no water; 2 shots. This tote always gives me and issue with this order saying that they cannot make it as follows; although the app offers that as an option for online ordering; and every other Starbucks out there has zero complications with this order. Infuriating. [REVIEW_11] My partner and I love McAlisters; but not this one! The service is horrible!! The manager leads by example- he does not seem to care that customers were waiting to place orders. He and two other employees did not acknowledge us or the other customers for at least 10 minutes. When he did he acted annoyed. The dining room was a mess; the employees were too busy engaged in their own conversations. We/I will not come back to this location. Though it is convenient we will go to the one in Creve Coeur. [REVIEW_12] Absolutely worst Hertz location!!!! We use hertz for a large company. I will not use it again in St Louis. Carried on luggage; off plane quickly; then waited 25 minutes for a shuttle. I saw all other vendors go by 3-4 times. Ghetto rude workers. [REVIEW_13] Place is horrible. They make it look on the website like it is a made to order deli but we disappointed to find this morning that it's actually just a couple day old sandwiches in a refrigerator and a bunch of random other crap. On top of that the sandwich was ass. [REVIEW_14] As 45 put it best...  this place is a ****hole.   To the people in charge of the entire brand Steak and Shake:  take note of how Freddy's operates. Ditch the worthless waiters who understandably are as motivated to return to the table as I am the proctologist..   it's flipping 3.99 meals and half the customers are kids. Of course you won't make crap for tips.   Put up a coke freestyle machine and have people place and order up front. I'll get my own refills and napkins. Faster mind you and with pleasure.   PS.  It's not normal to had a 4 year old a fully loaded plate of food. [REVIEW_15] Pretty slow service and the waitresses aren't very kind. I guess I was expecting something different at a diner with high ratings but I understand it's in the middle of a tourist area. However; service should be a priority. Something that really bothered me was how much trash was left on the floor of the outside deck- it all has the potential to blow right into the ocean. NOT OKAY. I had to stand up several times to grab straw wrappers and napkins before they blew into the water. If you're going to have a waterfront/beach front business; be responsible about it. It would be a very easy fix-just a screen on the bottom of the fence. The food was good but I won't be back.",0
25,"[REVIEW_1] My absolute favorite coffee place in Reno! Love everything here; including their mochas; lavender lattes; food (there's an AMAZING bread pudding). Great atmosphere where you can hang out with friends or study. Also love the Coffeebar in Truckee! [REVIEW_2] Wonderfully busy yet graciously homey atmosphere. I have been coming here a few times a month for the incredible Cajun-inspired Pasta Alfredeaux topped off with Cookie Dough Egg Rolls. Bring friends; bring a date; sit on the patio and people watch in this great area of Nashville. [REVIEW_3] I can't say enough good things about Cash-n-Carry Paper! Like; literally; I could go on for hours! These have to be the friendliest group of guys to ever run a company. They're pleasant; hilarious; knowledgeable and they make you feel attended to rather than pushed.  It's always nice to be able to peruse around a store and not be hounded; yet also be asked if assistance is needed. They never seem impatient or frustrated even if you ask for a dozen different things at a dozen different times. I've seen them walk people around the store getting every item that customer needed and they did it with a smile.   My hubs and I cater for a living so once we found this place; we made it our goal to shop there as often as possible. Their prices are better and their selection is more vast than some of their paper supplying counterparts.   They greet you immediately with genuine smiles and their smiles linger in the atmosphere as you shop. It's such a great little business. I hope they have nothing but success. They deserve it. They got the business and customer service formulas right! [REVIEW_4] When you need a glass of wine over lunch to relieve your hectic mid-week morning; this is great place to be.  Simple but well created dishes; and good recommendation for wine from the staff.   The chicken sandwich over chilled wine certainly helped me today. [REVIEW_5] Excellent venue for a quick lunch! NY style pizza accompanied by a delicious fresh salad.  They offer Daily weekday specials.  The best part is sitting out on the shady patio. [REVIEW_6] Emilio Valsecchi has been my mechanic for well over 10 years; he's  meticulous in the attention and care of his work. his skills vary from domestic to the most difficult Import vehicles. if your looking for an honest mechanic...i highly recommend Emilio; he takes wonderful care of my Land Rover. [REVIEW_7] Fabulous; quick; stress free windshield repair. .. didnt cost a penny out of pocket. I would definitely use this company again and would recommend to anybody!! [REVIEW_8] Wings Wings and more Wings!  Chatham Tap is my favorite place to get wings in the Indianapolis area.  They are meaty; the sauce is great; and I usually always have to take some home for the next day.  I went with a fairly large group and got to sample different things on the menu.  I highly recommend the onion rings!  They have a large selection of beer as well.  Since I heard they were a ""soccer bar"" I did not know what to expect when I first arrived.  However; the atmosphere is great.  It is full of fans of all different sports and the staff is willing to show whatever sport you want to watch on TV.  The service was excellent.  No one in my group had to ask for one thing while we were there.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who is up for a great meal; great service and a great time with friends. [REVIEW_9] So I hear whispers of a reemergence of brunch I truly believe this is the best brunch spot in New Orleans.  And they only do it once a year. Great local favors. Great service Their so called biscuits and debris should be called the ""life changing flavorgasm"" at that moment when you realize simplicity and perfection collide; dazed and confused you will awaken your senses at Carrollton market. The oyster good enough French omelet is everything I wanted in life and more. Thank you @Carrolltonmarket I am speechless. And that does not happen often [REVIEW_10] Food here is amazing! Ordered beef ragu and chicken ragu. Both dishes are very tasty! Plus it's BYOB!!! [REVIEW_11] From the very early stages of a venue visit to finalizing details of the big day; the Riviera Mansion exceeded our expectations. Breanna is an incredible coordinator--so lovely and warm to work with.   After researching several venues; we decided that the Riviera Mansion was a great fit for us. The menu looked fantastic; the staff was super accommodating; and Breanna really worked with us and our wedding planner to help design the vision and ""look"" we were going for. We said we wanted everything to be outdoors...no problem. We said we wanted string lighting and chandeliers in the trees...no problem. We wanted to use all the ourdoor lawn for cocktail hour; dinner and dancing; have a live band and a dj; sweetheart table and cake table. If we dreamed it up; Breanna and the staff were all hands on deck to work to accommodate it.   A few months before the event; we did our tasting for the menu. And the food was OUTSTANDING! Really great portions; delicious flavors and beautiful presentation. And I will say that the food was consistent from tasting to the actual wedding; and our guests RAVED about it. We even had people asking for seconds! Wedding food is never something that typically stands out; but I can say the steak and the fish options we had were absolutely delicious. And again; Breanna and the kitchen were able to accommodate when I requested that the fish needed to be wild and sustainably caught--again no problems.  I would be remiss if I did not mention the Food & Beverage manager; Eli. Eli was such a sweetheart--making sure we thought about everything during the preparation walk through meeting and that we were happy the day of and throughout the event. You can tell he takes great pride and joy in his job and venue.  Breanna; Eli and team were so flawless in organizing everything that we honestly had nothing to worry about--working with this venue was stress free; which made for two very happy brides. The venue is beautiful; the staff is so dedicated and happy; and the service was wonderful. I can't say enough good things about the Riviera Mansion and their ability to host a great party! [REVIEW_12] Dr. Biscardi is really an eye expert. My eyes are having complicated problems; some doctors even do not sure which is the best way to treat my left eye. She helped me to order a very special type of contacts for my eyes. Dr. Biscardi was very patient and explained my every concern. FYI; she seems having a busy schedule; need to book an appointment in a month advance. [REVIEW_13] We had to use this main post office to get passports and although they get really busy; the passport guys at this location are a class act.  So; the passport office here opens at 8:30am and it's the only post office in Tampa that you can walk in for passports. I had to get my children passports and it was about time for me and HubbyStanks to renew. Since the only appointment we could get closer to home was during a school day we decided to walk in. The gentleman who I spoke to on the phone about the walk in was nice enough to let me know about arriving before it opens if I want to get things done without the longest wait.   We got there at 8:15 and already there were people waiting outside with numbers. How nice that a postal worker came out and passed out numbers to the early birds. When it opened we were number 29! Although there were only 2 lines working at a time; the men behind the desk would give a person paperwork if they didn't already have it filled out; call the next number; then ask if the last number was ready. Wow! You won't find that at the DMV or any other government office.   Another gentleman came from the back to ask if there were any renewals and since HubbyStanks and I were renewing he took care of our paperwork without us having to wait for our number. We then sat back down with our kids. When it was our kids turn our postal guy; who was retired navy; was so cool; cheerful and friendly. He made us smile and we even talked about different Naval bases that we lived.  HubbyStanks realized he needed to expedite his passport so we went into the main post office to retrieve our mail and make the change. Everyone was so helpful in allowing us to change our mind and make the changes!   If you need to walk into a post office or even book an appointment I highly recommend using the main post office. They really have it together here. They make a somewhat painful experience a lot less painful with their awesome customer service. [REVIEW_14] The Cubby Hole is very intimate and has great food. I've been there several times for lunch and breakfast; they don't disappoint. The coffee and baked goods are excellent. [REVIEW_15] Very fresh ingredients with an authentic taste. Priced per taco to mix and match- which I prefer. Would definitely come back for my next taco fix!",15
26,"[REVIEW_1] My boyfriend and I were looking for some good Mexican food for his birthday; and since I missed the boat on getting a reservation at El Vez I figured we would give this a try. The reviews seemed okay and everyone said that the drinks were really good.   Not at all true....  To start with; we ordered the guacamole. I have had a lot of different kinds and make it myself at home; and this was incredibly bland with not a lot of flavor.  I ordered the Carnitas Tacos and my boyfriend got the Brisket Tacos (special of the day). They were all right; but the waiter told us right off the bat he would recommend a side since they were small portions.  We didn't end up eating any of our side since they were so big; we each only finished two tacos!   The most disappointing part of this whole experience was the drinks.  I got the Classic Mojito (which I have also had and made many times before) and he got the Mexican style Mojito; that apparently is with cilantro and tequilla instead of rum and mint.  The first batch were really delicious; so we ordered another round. Not at ALL the same drink.  They looked very different; but mainly they didn't taste at all similar.  Very very sweet and acidic; way too bitter.  We politely called the waiter over and asked if the bartender wouldn't mind remaking them since the first drinks we had were very different; and he obliged. A few seconds later the bartender came back and told us she remade the drinks but tasted them and they tasted exactly how they should be.  She was very condescending and rude (My boyfriend and I have both worked in customer service before...when customers are being polite in their complaints; there is no need to be rude back) and said she would make the drink for us 10 times if we wanted but it wouldn't be any different. She said that they first AMAZING drink we had must have been made wrong.  She kept asking us how they were different and we had trouble explaining to her exactly what to change; so we decided to let it go and asked for the check. Yes; we still got charged for the shitty drinks that we left on our table.   For a tequilla bar who is apparently known for their drinks; the inconsistency is frightening.  I was very disappointed in the entire experience; not what I was planning for the first birthday that my boyfriend and I spent together. [REVIEW_2] Went for Dinner; it's BYOB so we brought some wine. Had some questions about the pasta dishes; Paula herself helped us. She even made a fresh zucchini pasta dish for my mom; as the one out had pancetta and my mother is vegetarian. She then recommended the pork chops with broccoli rabe and fried polenta. It was amazing; pork chops were juicy with a crisp outside; broccoli rabe had little to no bitterness and a delicious garlic flavor; polenta was crisped just right. Had tiramisu for dessert; the portion was generous; the flavor was delicious and decadent. Paula was incredibly nice; checked in with us and even remembered our names. Would absolutely come back! [REVIEW_3] I blame these guys for my bloated tool collection; because there are only so many keys I need copied; but whenever I pass by; I just HAVE to go in to shoot the breeze with the owner and/or employees. The relevant: they somehow manage to have every single thing I've ever needed; from specialty sizes of sanding belts; electrical supplies; crazy novelty keys; extra-extra-long drill bit collars. The irrelevant: between the three guys; you will always have a great conversation about music; travel; drugs; sports; history; or politics waiting for you. A real gem! [REVIEW_4] Don't waste your money and time! Although they have an attractive price of $21 for buffet but it's a rip off! I came here with my family tonight. It was a get together and we had 24 people in our party. We didn't expect too much since the price was very reasonable for sushi and korean food; however; we were extremely disappointed by the quality of the food. Nothing tastes fresh; and that's pretty scary when serving sushi. Additionally; most of the trays were either empty or only had little portion of food on them. We saw other tables eating raw oysters but when we went up to grab some there were none. We then waited and didn't see any come out for 20 minutes. We then asked the waiter to check and after 45 minutes a chef brought about 10 oysters out. He then said ""that's it; no more"" in a rude tone of voice. When my aunt asked one of the chefs if he would bring more out. These were his exact words: ""this is a buffet; not oyster buffet"". We asked the waiter if we could speak to the boss and the waiter said that chef was the boss. Really? That's how you treat customers? I'm pretty sure they won't be in business for long. I suggest going elsewhere! [REVIEW_5] Had a wonderful experience with JT and Ashley Furniture store!! He was helpful even when I had to change my order. [REVIEW_6] Very disappointing customer service here. Seems like the employees are too busy running around restocking shelves to actually assist customers. Looks like the issue is poor management. I prefer clothing stores that focus more on customer service than stocking shelves. [REVIEW_7] By far the best breakfast I have had in a while. Huge pancakes. Simple home fries with not all the extras. The owner is super sweet and really generous. Deffinetly a new favorite. [REVIEW_8] Took my vehicle here for some work a few years ago for a manufacturer recall. Problem went away and then started hearing another noise which I thought was related; but turned out was a completely different issue. Kevin and his mechanic lifted my car right up and fixed the issue FREE OF CHARGE even though I told them I'd pay. Outstanding individuals for doing that. Highly recommend! [REVIEW_9] This hotel is a gem in the heart of Philadelphia.  It's a cozy; quaint; and charming property. The rooms are spacious; modern and gorgeous.  The decor is chic and attractive: big wooden desk; hardwood floors; couches and throw pillows: Looks more like a friend's apartment than a hotel.   Free breakfast is always a plus for those of us with limited time. It's not a hot breakfast (I've had so many mass-produced bad ones; so I'm not complaining) but greek yogurt; a huge croissant; an orange and some cranberry juice hits the spot! They leave it at your door though; instead of ringing your bell to wake you. So if you ask for it to be delivered at 7 a.m.; check outside your door; by 7:01 it WILL be there.   Coffee; a variety of teas; cold and hot water; as well as ice and a bowl of assorted fruit are available 24/7 in the lobby. There are doorbells for each room; and the hotel can only be accessed after hours if you have a key card. Floors are acessible with a keycard as well; for extra protection. The staff is very polite: one of the few places in Philly where someone will actually say ""good morning"" to you (No; seriously. I lived there for 5 years; so trust me on that). They're also extremely helpful. When I checked in the night before; the gentleman at the reservation desk called to make sure I had a cab waiting for me at 8:15 the next morning so that I could make my speaking engagement on time. While I was getting my clothes ready; my iron was making more wrinkles than it was taking out; so I asked them for a new one and within 30 seconds; I had a brand new model with all the bells and whistles.  I've read a few reviews talking about the noise level of this place. My room was closest to the reception desk and I never heard a peep. There were people out and about; but I didn't hear a thing. And I'm a very light sleeper...  A few things to note: Its location on a tight; one way street can cause a little difficulty if you're traveling solo; but if you have one person to unload the car while someone else parks; you should be fine. The parking garage they use is about half a block from the hotel; but you have to drive in a big rectangle to get there.   There's a stand-up shower instead of the traditional bathtub/shower combo. It fits one comfortably enough... provided that you're not too far from average height and build. (My boyfriend is 6'2 with a football player build and he made out okay.)  Don't expect much of a view. The view from our room was of the side of another building. But that's what the city is for... go out there and see something!  Overall; this was an excellent trip and a great find. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone. [REVIEW_10] A GREAT used book shop.... very few duds.  I  CAN NOT comprehend these lazy; ""elite"" Yelpers who give this place three stars and complain that they have to look for books in actual space.  It's not Google or Amazon; it's reality.  Living in it; drifting through their jammed stacks is bliss; finding something you weren't looking for is bliss cubed.  Huzzah for Book Trader! [REVIEW_11] I have been several times and it has been adequate. The last two times I have been there it has been TERRIBLE. The portions have diminished and the quality of the dishes have followed suit. I mean to a detrimental degree. I would not recommended dining here. [REVIEW_12] I bought my first road bike from Keswick Cycle. I was extremely pleased with the sales staff and had a great overall experience. Fernando deserves a special mention as he is extremely knowledgeable. His professionalism and excellence enabled me to get a great fitting bike; on time! [REVIEW_13] I have to say I thought that this was going to be an awesome body shop; based off of their reviews. I was very wrong; and now I am extremely disappointed. I figured I'd at least leave a review; so others would not share my experience.  I went here after I was involved with an accident; my insurance company USAA referred me to this shop. Upon arriving the place is clean and look like a secure lot to leave your car in night after night while getting it repaired; the front-end staff was friendly (Jackie is a sweetie) and the gentleman Kenny that quoted me seemed nice until I started asking question.  I explain to the Kenny what happen during the accident; once I was done he started writing his initial estimate. The original estimate that  was made; is made before my car is even worked on and is just preliminary; this is not a true or accurate estimate since the car has not been worked on or disassembled to see further damages. However Kenny definitely did a less then par-look of my vehicle that he told be needed about $500.00 in repairs. What a Joke.   This was odd to me because I had taken it to a non-USAA body shop before taking it here; so that I could have an unbiased estimate. When I started asking Kenny question he quickly got defensive about the quote stating that this is all USAA would cover.   This confused me an truly contradicted the 1st body shop I choose to stop at (Which was Infinite of Tampa) Still I think its funny that I got quoted at a few other very well know and highly rated body shops in the area later that day that were also not on the USAA list and they quoted me a proper and accurate quotes so that my car was not two toned and it was a complete repair from the loss.    Kenny said statements like: **(""Each of these additional areas contain pre existing damage not related to this loss (stone chips and sub standard prior bumper repair."")** Kenny was happy to quote me but not happy to submit a supplement estimate that would cause about $2000 more worth of charges. He said things like ""USAA will not over it.""  So verse Kenny backing up his new customer; to help the insurance company see why the repair needed to be done this way; he decided to tell me I will need to do the run around to get it cover. What a bunch of cowards... You would think that they would want all the business they can get; like most small businesses. However I understand why they wouldn't do the repairs; it affects their relationship with USAA; because they would have had to express to USAA that the cheap amount of $500 that they already distributed to me was not going to cover the true repair.  Advice For Kenny:  Most cars in all of America have normal wear and tear damages that are common and irrelevant; to the accident. Which in this case damage the right of my bumper and right fender and right H.I.D.  I think every driver in America can agree that they have some random scratches and stone chips on the their vehicle; this shouldn't stop your insurance company from doing a complete repair. People like Kenny should genuinely be ashamed when saying things like this to insurance consumers trying to hoodwink them out of a complete repair.    However I guess when your business is fed LEADS from USAA it is necessary to keep USAA happy; by doing the cheapest possible repair to your car. I don't think as a consumer it is at all wrong to tell your insurance companies that the cheap quote from they're less then par-auto body shop won't do. The Fact is a USAA adjuster never said that the repair couldn't be covered you Kenny just thought it couldn't be covered; and misleading customers in no joke.  I want everyone to know that if you choose this body shop base on a USAA recommendation; prepare not to be heard and your concerns invalided; with trivial insurance BS; as you will only get the repair that they think they will get approved with the insurance companies; and not the repair your car deserves.    Side Note:  USAA cover all the cost that this auto body shop said they wouldn't. Thanks USAA; as I know consumer who pays the monthly bill to be insured properly is your number one concern. Big thank you to Infiniti of Tampa for sticking by me to make sure all the repairs got covered. [REVIEW_14] My husband and I were visiting New Orleans and decided to schedule a couples massage. Our experience was great! My therapist was able to get all the painful knots out of my back. I could already feel the difference before I even walked out the door. My husband was so relaxed during his massage that he fell asleep. The atmosphere and decor were my favorite part of this experience. The low lighting and comfy chairs really promote relaxation. I have been to many different spas in many cities and the atmosphere here is always what I look for in a spa but rarely find. I wished they had light hors d'oeuvres and cold water option. The water was room temperature. Would definitely recommend this spa to a friend and we will definitely visit again next time we are in New Orleans. [REVIEW_15] DO NOT GET LASER HAIR REMOVAL DONE HERE!!! I purchased a Groupon for 6 sessions and 8 sessions later barely saw any results. Keep in mind that I am a perfect candidate for laser having fair to medium skin tone and dark hair.  The staff's reaction to my concern/frustration was ""well everyone is different"" and that they would do an ""in house Groupon"" if I wanted to buy another package. Why would I waste more money on something that didn't work in the 1st place?? I should also mention that I'm not the only person who did not have good results; a friend of mine had the exact same experience at Co Capelli.  I'm not sure if their laser is bad or if the people administering it just don't know what they're doing; but I didn't show up for my 9th appointment (I would have had to purchase more sessions-NO THANKS). Funny thing is that nobody even bothered to call and ask if I needed to reschedule; which you would think is pretty standard when you miss an appointment.   However; there is a silver lining to all of this. The Groupon gods must have taken pity on me and an offer popped up recently for  Hairfree Nashville; a place that actually SPECIALIZES in hair removal  (it was even $10 cheaper than what I originally paid at Co Capelli). I was hesitant but decided to give it a try and WOW...amazing results after the 1st session. These people are REAL professionals (not some girls who decided they needed a break from cutting hair and wanted to play around with a laser). I didn't realize how awful Co Capelli actually was until I experienced Hairfree Nashville. The space is lovely and does not reek of salon chemicals which is an added bonus; and the staff is VERY knowledgeable about the process of hair removal. The laser itself is 1000 times better and blows a cool stream of air so it was MUCH less painful. I was also given real goggles to shield my eyes that fit like sunglasses; not the uncomfortable metal tanning bed goggles that mess up your eye makeup which Co Capelli for some reason has opted to use.   Bottom line- if you are seriously considering investing the time and money for hair removal please do not make the same mistake I did. Go to a place that actually specializes in laser like Hairfree Nashville. You will not be disappointed! http://www.hairfreenashville.com/",9
27,"[REVIEW_1] Great atmosphere with a beautiful view. You can sit on the back dock and listen to the music. The menu is small but the food was very good and well presented. The staff was great and very pleasant. Overall; this is a great place to come relax and enjoy the beautiful weather while eating some delicious food and having a run runner.  And the best part is this place is dog friendly! [REVIEW_2] In the heart of my hood; I adore crescent park. Out of towners should check it out for the views alone. Clean; well-maintained; and fresh flowers keep me coming back for more. I love the ""softer"" running paths that give the knees a Lil' break! A great compliment to an wonderful corner of our city. The dog run is also a plus (water fountain and all!). [REVIEW_3] One of many stops here it's always fresh food for a reasonable price .My favorite appetizer is the blackened calamari and alligator . It's small and cozy but they are expanding . [REVIEW_4] I've been to New Orleans several times but this time I was looking for a different kind of dessert type of treat aside from the go-to beignets. So I found this spot on Yelp. They had 8-10 flavors to choose from so we got 4 of them. Praline bacon; raspberry white chocolate; pineapple upside down; and cookies and milk. Praline bacon was the 1st one we tried and it was a tough act to follow! It was a flavor party where sweet; savory and yummy had me dancing. The pineapple upside donut was good. The raspberry was my least favorite. However; the cookies and milk pulled up the rear and made the wait worth it. Overall; the donuts are great and whatever batter they use for the actual donut is really tasty. I will be back for some donuts AND sliders next time. [REVIEW_5] What a cool museum! Lots of hands-on; engaging displays. Wide variety of activities from science to art to exploring jobs like boat pilot and being a vet. Not so big to feel overwhelming; relatively healthy food option (subway) and no gift shop to try and wrangle your munchkins through.   The museum is clean; staff friendly; and safety has been thought about in each exhibit. This is truly one of the best museums we have seen in a bit - and our keepers agreed (and had as much fun as us monkeys!).  The Verdict: If you are in Tampa and looking for a great activity; check this space out - you won't be sorry!  Enjoy the Ride! Baker & Biker [REVIEW_6] Great burgers!  Still full in the morning with a meat hangover.  Fries were excellent too.  Service was good.  Busy night but felt taken care of.  Highly recommend. [REVIEW_7] Surprised I haven't posted a review for Twisted Iron before - I've tried them a number of times since they arrived on the road. From their waffle fries to their chicken and waffles - Twisted Iron has always whipped out some tasty food truck eats that are both unique and delicious. I was really happy to see them out and about after Tampa Luv Chicken's unfortunate ending.  Although I'm not originally from Tampa; I would say my taste for fried chicken and waffles is probably the most Southern thing about me and Twisted Iron delivers. The owners are young and friendly - clearly passionate about their food. Prices average $6-$10 which is standard for food truck food.  The actual food truck itself is modern with a clean wrap and mostly visible interior. I'm not much of a dessert guy - but I do like waffle dessert choices that are offered by Twisted Iron.  Shoutout to Anna M. for sharing some of her pulled pork waffle fries with me today at the food court - they were delicious and hit the spot! I hope to see Twisted Iron around soon with some new creations. [REVIEW_8] We were really hoping to find a very good; local Vietnamese restaurant ...unfortunately this is not it! After reading the glowing reviews of other diners we had high hopes...but after our mediocre meal I thought maybe we had stumbled into the wrong place. The decor was nonexistent; bathroom filthy; and our appetizer was served after our main courses. If the food was excellent I could overlook all that...but the food was very disappointing. We won't be back...and our search continues for a good Vietnamese meal. [REVIEW_9] Jenna and Noel exhibited the perfect example of impeccable service and genuine hospitality. I was driving when I got a flat tire and had to pull into the Fleming's parking lot. The roadside assistance service was taking forever so I walked into Fleming's for food and drink. The kitchen was closed at 2:00 and not opening until 4 o'clock for dinner; but Jenna and Noel happened to overhear my telephone conversation about my flat tire situation. They immediately poured me a drink and asked the Chef to open the kitchen early to cook me a meal. After they also invited me to try a new wine they were considering adding to the menu. They went above and beyond for me during a time they were not supposed to be working simply because they knew I was dealing with a stressful situation. Acts of kindness like this are rarer than gold. I never do online reviews but I could not let this story go untold. Thank you for the excellent food and service! Will certainly be back! [REVIEW_10] Great fresh oysters. I'm giving them five stars for the wonderful happy hour. 75 cent oysters from 3 to 6. Friendly and quick service. [REVIEW_11] Checked out the first show of the evening on a Friday. We got in line at 7pm for the 8pm show because it's a small room and it gets crowded. We were around 10th in line and got a seat versus having to stand in the back. And the wait goes by quickly because of all the hoopla going on in the French Quarter at that hour. We saw a really creepy looking stilts monster walk by...he even stopped to chat and take pictures. We saw the Preservation Hall Jazz Masters featuring Leroy Jones.It was an amazing experience. A couple of the tunes were mellow but most were lively and since it's a live band in a small room you really feel the music! All the musicians were fantastic and they feature each other with a mini-solo in most of the songs so you can appreciate each instrument. Admission is $15 for about an hour of music but totally worth it. Definitely a must-see in New Orleans. [REVIEW_12] I had a great experience last oil change. It was back in September but it was great! The techs were friendly and efficient! They sent a letter thanking me for coming in and included a $10 coupon! I will definitely be back! [REVIEW_13] This place is just the best. If you really have to ask why it's all in the name itself. If u don't like chicken then don't come here bc their birds are fly! Don't forget to try their fried corn on the cobs. It's dank! [REVIEW_14] Has many beer choices that are only available at bar that were served in unclean glass.  Wine pour was very small for the large price.  Restroom appears to have been cleaned last week my shoes stick for a moment with every step '' heavy pee smell all the way home''  I would go here again if I became a drunk with very low standards. [REVIEW_15] Oh. Mi. Gawd.  Eat. HERE!!!  Don't pass go. Don't collect $200. Eat. HERE!!!!   The bacon is to die for!!  The br√ªl√©e-d grapefruit - please can I have this every morning!!!  I got the fig & prosciutto toast. It's all soo soo soo good!!  I don't love breakfast but I may have changed my mind. The wait is a bit long but it is WORTH EVERY freaking second.  Try the champagne mojito for a nice refreshing twist on mimosas!!!   Eat here - have you figured out yet that your mouth and your belly will dance?!?!   Eat. Here!!!!",13
28,"[REVIEW_1] STAY AWAY!  TOTAL THIEVES.  The worst customer service I have ever received.  I went to this studio for awhile and enjoyed it.  Then I had to cancel for medical reasons; so I went into the studio; spoke with the guy at the desk and filled out a cancellation form.  They kept billing my credit card; so I went back in and showed them my cancellation form.  The guys at the desk said sorry; we'll refund you.  A week later; the manager calls me and says I'm a liar; that I forged the form; he's not refunding my money; and he's going to keep billing me.  Then he said I need to come back in AGAIN to fill out another form.  I could not believe it.  The manager called me a liar and a forger and pledged to keep steeling my money.  WTF?  DEFINITELY DON'T SIGN A MONTHLY CONTRACT!  They might steal your money; too.  Then call you a liar. [REVIEW_2] Darn awesome. Love the ambiance; love the food; love the music. My father even drank whiskey here and loved it; which is just crazy making. Also very friendly and fun bartenders/staff. Highly recommended.  Only downside - it gets packed; and there's really no place to wait. [REVIEW_3] Love it here  The atmosphere is great the options are more than average and the lunch bento boxes are great.  If you have the opportunity always try the boba as well.  Those complaining are just picky and should go back to eating at home.    Try their beef braised soup as it is hearty and delicious. [REVIEW_4] Define the worst Mediterranean food I have ever had.  The hummus appeared to have a good texture; that is the little bit I could see under the ocean of olive oil.  The pita bread was burned- not just over toasted; but black on the majority of the wedges.  I went home and was sick the rest of the evening from the amount of oil it had in it.   The manager was probably the worst of the experience. He told my gf he would ""upgrade her hummus for no charge; because normally it's $1.00"" but said it as if he was doing us this huge favor.  He then continued to yell at us from across the restaurant after we sat down  (instead of coming up to our table and actually having a conversation) and says; ""please let me know how your food is because that's the only way I can know if we are doing a good job or not is when customers tell me.""  But we agreed that the vibe he gave off would not be that of open mindedness and gratitude if we were to say anything about his plate of olive oil; er I mean hummus.  There is also a sign that advertises the ""cleanest bathroom in town"".... Ehhhh ok; good to know for our next road trip. [REVIEW_5] Will never go to this dealership again.  Got a written price quote via email for a Honda Odyssey. Went to the dealership; but they did not have the color and model I wanted (in which case why quote a price; but lets just ignore that as agressive marketing.) We agreed that they would add a DVD player to a lesser model; and also agreed on the price - this time with a printed quote in my hand. Went back after a week to close the deal and pick up the van; but they wanted a higher price; in effect renegging on the deal.  I walked out.  Went to a different dealership - Burns Honda - where I got the model I wanted and at the promised price. [REVIEW_6] I went to this salon to get the devacut which is dry cutting for naturally curly hair and I came out in love! My stylist was Mario he did an amazing job on my hair. I have dry; thin 3a 3b hair and he knew exactly what to do. He did my cut which I needed badly and diffused and used Devachan products. Love it!! Thanks Mario!  *You have curly hair? Get your hair cut here!* [REVIEW_7] The scallops and broiled crab cakes are really good! I rarely like seafood at diners but it's excellent here. [REVIEW_8] Went there the other night and the service was horrible. Girl behind counter yawned in my face than said ""what you want?"" Seriously? That's how you ask to take my order? Wow.. Trying not to judge the entire experience on terrible service; we tried our sundaes and were even less impressed. Our turtle sundae didn't have any caramel in it - you know -one of the main ingredients; my Christy had the worst iced brownie in it if ever tasted - total bargain basement; still frozen; so bad even a little Debbie brownie would have been a massive upgrade & the Smore was a pretty light on toppings; pretty sad excuse... Not going to waste my money here again; that's for sure! Will spend my money @ How Sweet Is This & Fritz's for now on; where I actually get what I pay for and more... [REVIEW_9] This place is great! We went twice with our 3 month old - once on a busy Friday night and once during the week and both times they sat us right away - stroller and everything!  The pizza is as close as you'll get to a slice of jersey style pizza. No soggy crust here. The pasta dishes and apps we tried were also very good. The delicious and free garlic knots pretty much guaranteed we were going to have leftovers - which we enjoyed the next day.  Overall; great service and experience - will be back many more times. [REVIEW_10] I have lived here for 8 months and have never been so infuriated by an apartment complex. I've been living in apartments for 15 years. They are way overpriced; too many hidden fees; apartments are old and poorly maintained. Apartment was dirty when I moved in. Carpets were not cleaned and walls not painted. Looks great on the outside. Are currently painting the buildings. I have had ongoing maintenance issues. I call on A/C every 3 to 4 weeks; malfunctioning smoke detectors; broken door lock; broken washer and hot water coming out if the cold water faucets. Nothing is ever resolved. Staff are pleasant but resolve nothing. Corporate is useless. I was advised they aren't there to resolve resident issues but were there for the shareholders. This is not my first experience with a Camden property but it will be my last.  There is a very detailed review dated May of 2015 regarding fees on apartment ratings.com. I would encourage all to read it. Every word us true. There are so many great Apartments in Tampa. Don't  choose this one!!!!!!!! [REVIEW_11] i cannot recall any major problems with projection or sound; so i'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say there were none.  but that's the only positive thing i have to say about this place.  not enough parking; lazy and incompetent staff; and screen-talking so loud and unchecked that it MUST be the norm here.   i seriously doubt that screen-talkers read reviews of theaters but in case you are one and you do: i didn't pay to hear your opinion; reaction; or synopsis of events for the person you came with that missed it because he went to the bathroom/was busy talking on his cell in the theater.    if the fact that you had to drive to it and are surrounded by strangers didn't clue you in; i'd think that for the prices they charge to see a movie you'd realize this isn't your living room.  i hate you.    end rant. [REVIEW_12] Amazing service;  food; menu and people.  Bacon pastry has no rival....  Simply amazing...... [REVIEW_13] This restaurant was a spare of the moment find and we truly lucked out! My best friend and I are total foodies and truly appreciate a full dining experience. Lately going out we have been disappointed in the lack of service at so many restaurants. We went in with no expectations other than it looked good on yelp. When you initially look at the menu and the descriptions; it automatically creates a high expectation for the food. I can say that there were 0 disappointments the entire night! We received exceptional service and excellent food! We ordered the Simple Green Salad (far from simple; DELICIOUS LIGHT DRESSING); The Prince Edward Island Mussels (PERFECTLY cooked- all mussels opened and not chewy at all!); The Grilled Lamb Loin; and Seared Red Snapper Veracruz Style- BOTH so unique and flavorful! For Dessert we had the bread pudding (best I have ever had in my life!)  The waiter was extremely personable and the manager came over multiple times to ensure that we were having a great experience. I have respect for this establishment- there are two types of people in this world; people who work for the paycheck and people who work because they love and care about what they do. This staff works for their wonderful reputation.You can tell that the Red Owl Tavern's employees try to establish a relationships with their guests; rather than just trying to flip tables and want to be hospitable. The manager was in communication with us the entire night; ensuring we were having a great experience; as well as the waiter being prompt and attentive from the moment we sat down to when we left. They even gave us the dessert on the house! We will definitely be returning to the Red Owl Tavern next time in Philly.  HIGHLY recommend the Red Owl Tavern:) [REVIEW_14] Great sushi and reasonably priced! Friendly staff is a plus! They recently expanded their menu which has been a lot of fun too!! The VIP card is great for frequent visitors and if someone in your party isn't up for sushi they can order from the Chinese place next door. [REVIEW_15] Poor selection of slot machines.  Tried the buffet and had bad service. Never had anyone check up on me or even get me a refill with an empty cup sitting on the table over half an hour. Food was also not good quality. Also felt sick the next day.  Went to a concert and it was delayed but they did not allow the band to play their full set.  I would still come back for concerts but not for any other reason. Also I would eat off property first.",8
29,"[REVIEW_1] So; so disappointed in this place. It used to be great when it first opened; but the past two times I've gone it's been terrible. The experience Villagio offers does not match up with the price of movie tickets; food; beverage; ect. If I'm paying $26 for two tickets; over $12 for food and beverage service then I expect to receive more than 1 star service AND for napkins; utensils; ect.. To be brought out with my meal. The staff looks miserable; no one seems to care about overall customer service. [REVIEW_2] Just walked out of this place.  When we got there the wait staff was all outside and we were the first people in there restaurant. We sat down they gave us water and then never came back. We waited 20 minutes again we were the only people here and NO ONE came and even asked us if we wanted a drink. We finally left without ordering after waiting the 20 minutes only to have a couple walk in sit down and have a waitress come up and start taking their order. Horrible service. This was our first time here and I wouldn't come back. @Nick from the blue duck  if you are at work now then you were one of the people who did this and yes it's unacceptable. [REVIEW_3] Ok had Sunday lunch with my mother and grandmother here and it was just terrible. Our server didn't even tell us his name and took forever for him to take our drink order. We asked for sweet and low with one of our unsweet teas and didn't receive it. Had to ask for it again to then receive the sweet and low. We ordered the bloomin onion and the chesse fries. The bloomin onion was not the onion the restaurant usually uses because it was on the spicy side. The chesse fires when on the ok side since they did not put much chesse or bacon on the appetizer. So in all reality we ordered a plate of fires with a little chesse and bacon. My grandmother ordered the 6oz steak and it was also on the spicy side. I however ordered the same thing but I ordered mine medium rare but when I got my steak it was rare instead of medium rare and also was really spicy.  We then had to ask for a bottle of steak sauce because if you ask for steak sauce for a party of three you will only get one tiny cup full of steak sauce for the whole table. Had to order a to go order for my father couldn't make it to lunch and our waiter said he would put it in after we had finished our meal. When we finished our food and the waiter gave us our check we still haven't received our to go order. Had to sit and extra five to ten minutes to get that said order. Lets just say we gave a bad tip. Be caution to this place not worth a hundred dollar bill for a spicy mouth and bad experience! [REVIEW_4] The service was lacking. The waiters and waitresses don't know the menu and when you ask for certain things to be brought to your table; it's constantly forgotten. The food is visually appealing but some of the most awkward and distasteful food I've ever had. The waffles are stale; the biscuits are hard as rock and their chorizo is not real chorizo.  The only thing this place has going for it is the atmosphere and their alcohol selection. [REVIEW_5] Absolutely delicious food every time! So fresh and so reasonably priced!! First place I come to when I come back home to New Orleans!  Love it!!! Friendly staff and awesome atmosphere! [REVIEW_6] Food showed up cold; salmon was raw inside; plastic in the dessert; fatty lamb chops and some sort of stringy thing at the bottom of my wine glass!! The service was great though. [REVIEW_7] Absolutely the worst meal I've had. The pizza was cold; the gyro meat looked like it was yesterday's offering; red potatoes were cold. $35 with two soft drinks. Upscale setting for awful food. Neighboring restaurants were full. Pita Jungle was empty on a Sunday night. [REVIEW_8] The ambiance and live music here is fantastic. The band was pleasant and not overbearingly loud.  However the whole ""you have to be out in 1.5 hours"" is a major turn off. I could understand if people were sitting around not ordering but if you're ordering food and drink that makes no sense.  The food was decent but nothing to write home about. The service however was terrible. Since everything is served tapas style the food comes out as it's ready. Unfortunately my tacos took so long that everyone was finished eating and I still didn't have my food.   Then I saw the table next to me (which arrived 30 min after us) served not one but two taco plates. When I asked the server what's going on; she gave me a really bitchy attitude and acted as though she was talking to a child. She goes ""yeah like I said the kitchen is backed up."" To which I said yes but not enough She did take them off the bill but her attitude was so off putting and condescending I didn't even care at that point.   The tacos still took another 15 min after that.   Also they have 2 different websites with different menus which is confusing. I went there based on one menu and got something different. Annoying. [REVIEW_9] So here recently the staff has apparently decided to just close up shop whenever they feel like it regardless of posted business hours; sometimes 7:30; sometimes sooner.  Makes you wonder if the owner or franchisee knows that.   The place improved for awhile and now it appears to be headed down hill again [REVIEW_10] This is the worst Taco Bell there is; and sadly; the only one open past 10; and sometimes 9 depending on how the others feel that day. I guess it's just a Nevada thing; or a Reno thing; but the Taco Bell's here are a joke and this is the worst. Been sitting in the drive-thru for 10 minutes only to be told the item I wanted isn't offered anymore; even though commercials are still playing for it. They've forgotten our food more than once; and I personally won't eat here (wife is the hopeful for it because she loves Taco Bell) because it's given us both food poisoning.  Go to Del Taco; same food poisoning; but you'll actually get your food in a timely manner; probably. [REVIEW_11] My boyfriend and I decided to go to The Smiling Elephant on a Friday night. We had about a 30 minute wait. Once we got inside we ordered. I got the Gai Jee and asked for it to be ""hot"". They gave me a sauce on the side. I poured it on top of my grilled chicken and white rice. I ate it and the sauce tasted awful. I thought maybe I was being picky so I let my boyfriend try. He thought it smelled and tasted awful. The only part of my meal that I could eat was the grilled chicken which was good; but not worth the price. Also the next day I was sick with food poisoning the entire day. I have never had food poisoning in my life and that was the only thing I had eaten differently in the past two days.  On the other hand. My boyfriend had the Pad Thai and he loved it. I tried it and it tasted pretty good.   No matter how good the Pad Thai was; I am not going to risk getting sick or getting a terrible meal again. [REVIEW_12] Absolutely the worst meal I've had in a very long time. Everything was super greasy; salad was old and wilted and I spent more time picking out the rotten pieces of lettuce than I did attempting to eat it. The ranch dressing; honey mustard and ""roadhouse"" dipping sauce were all disgusting. The fries and chicken tenders were not only greasy but looked and tasted like someone's leftover lunch from yesterday that they over cooked in a microwave.  Again; worst meal ever! [REVIEW_13] I'm from out of town and picked up an awful sinus infection. I neeeeeded hot and sour soup. I got broth with some vegetables and about 2 ounces of corse ground pepper. It was awful. I ordered for my son and husband and their food was awful. The crab Rangoon was burnt.  Three entrees; 1 pint hot and sour soup and one order crab Rangoon. It was almost 60 bucks for tiny boxes of food. [REVIEW_14] After trying to talk Thai with Chef & waitress so I tried it here but come out super...disappointed :( Okay their menu has variety noodle styles to choose but not even one item that we love.  ie. we ordered (SUPER spicy) somtom came out just a plain salad on top with dipping sauce from the bottle; curry tasted suck even my white folks said so :(  Don't get me wrong; this restaurant may great for some local clients but I won't recommend you trying if you seeking for authentic Thai taste. [REVIEW_15] A few years ago I bit into my roasted peppers AND a fish hook. The staff could not have cared less; pretty much insinuating I brought the hook with me to put in their food. They didn't even take the dish off the check; even though I wouldn't eat it or anything else after nearly having my gums impaled. I'll never go back & have advised others to stay away. Not even an apology. I should say there was a lot of blood & they couldn't wait to get me out of there (after paying the full bill). Rude does not even begin to describe that staff.",1
30,"[REVIEW_1] Great shop! Lots of options. Very helpful service -- David will help you pick out everything. Framed 5 items. Reasonable prices too! [REVIEW_2] A+++ service and accommodations. Food was delicious and came promptly. Servers were friendly and clean. A little pricey but we chose to eat on the pier; so we knew it ahead of time. Overheard a conversation with the manager and a patron where the manager was going out of his way to accommodate for the patron but the customer chose to leave instead. Great service we will come back every year. [REVIEW_3] Waked in and ordered a meal. Simple; 1 egg; regular hashbrowns; order of bacon. 30 minutes later I get just my bacon. And now I'm still waiting. The worst staff. [REVIEW_4] This is the first time I have tried this place and I will definitely be coming back. The wait staff was very friendly and explained things with ease. Shortly after we sat down a plate was brought out with papad; a lentil cracker. With it was 3 different types of chutney. They were all equally good. We started off with Vegi Samosas; and Gobi Gopura. Both were excellent. I have never had anything with Cauliflower that tasted so good. You must give it a try. I had the Bangan Bhar as my entree. An Eggplant dish with tomatoes; onion; and a spice blend that sent it over the edge with flavor. The portion size was large and left me with leftovers I can't wait to dig into.   I was surprised at how dead the restaurant was for 7pm. As we were there other people starting making their way in. Restaurants don't stay in this location for very long. I'm not sure why. But; I hope this one is here to stay. Definitely check it out. [REVIEW_5] The Real Deal  We ate some of the finest pastries I've ever had in my life at this bakery. Word.  We were fortunate enough to be with the other Gruntled Brunchers; who are friends of the proprietors of the bakery; so we were treated to a sampling of many of their pastries.   Just some of what we tried: opera cake - a moist; multilayered cake which reminded me of tira misu; apple strudels; fruit tarts;  eclairs; chocolate covered strawberries. All were delicious; but; then; the cheese puff pastry came out.   The cheese puff pastry is on a level all its own. Impossibly; insanely flaky; just sweet enough; almost salty. How can this be? I could have eaten five of these. Make certain you don't miss this.  We were fortunate to be there on Good Friday; so we could get a hot cross bun. I thought a hot cross bun was some hard crusted bread with a cross cut in the top for rising. I was so; so wrong. This traditional treat is a brioche-type bread with a tiny sprinkling of sweet fruit pieces throughout; and an icing ""X"" drawn on the top. Again; light; airy; with sweetness that is a hint; not a sledgehammer. There's a bunch of history behind the hot cross bun; and Patricia; the executive chef; took the time to tell us. Check it out on Wikipedia if you're curious.  And; I have to say something about the raspberry ""bear claw"". If you've ever had what others call a bear claw; forget those. Brent said it's an insult to this crazy-good; flaky; just-right pastry to name it the same thing you can get out of a vending machine.   We took a field trip; as Harry said; through the kitchen; where Ziggy; the owner; pastry chef; and all-around nice guy; was making a Harry Potter wizard hat cake. He rolled out fondant icing and expertly threw the thick layer over the cake. He gave us a taste of the fondant. In my experience; fondant is pretty but not so tasty. Not so for this chocolate fondant. Mmmmmmm! I would happily have eaten a huge slab of this stuff.   We left with a tea cake in tow. Ziggy told us it was something like a Kugelhof; and not as heavy as a pound cake. It was so beautiful; I simply had to try one; though at this point I really didn't need more pastries. I had a piece as soon as I could get a knife. Again; unbelievable...I can't say more. Somehow it was simultaneously buttery but light; and just moist enough without approaching stickiness. I had more of this than I care to admit right after I'd eaten my weight in sweets.  At this point; I'm glad I do not live down the street from Maple Street Patisserie. I could see myself having a problem if I lived too close to a bakery this tempting.  Just to sum it all up: the sweet pastries are delectable; but the breads; brioches; bear claws!; and tea cakes are in a class all their own.  And; I haven't even tried the savory croissants yet. [REVIEW_6] I am a regular at this Scotty's location.  I have been to all but one Scotty's (Bloomington); and this one is the cleanest and the friendliest.  The manager always comes over to greet us; and he and my pop go at it over what school is better purdue or IU.  It's great for him to have someone like that to nit pick with.  There is a kids place as well.  I don't recommend you sit over there if you are trying to hear the game; or your partner.  I love this place.  I rave about it to friends about how much better it is than downtown; 96 or even three wise.  One gripe...the French press coffee would be much better if you ground the beans more coarse.  My mom always gets grounds in her cup...even after waiting the recommended time.  If you did that; it would be perfect!  Thanks! [REVIEW_7] One of the best burgers I've ever had! Village Whiskey has high-quality meat; great preparation; and awesome sides -- it's my favorite burger place in downtown Philly.   The aioli and fries are delicious; too. Last time I tried truffled cauliflower; I'm not usually a huge fan of picked foods; but it was fantastic! The cauliflowers and carrots were crispy; and the juice had a light but very tasty flavor. I would definitely order it again.   The one catch: it is pretty expensive. Probably place you would go to for an especially fun or nice meal; but might not be able to afford each week.   The decor is cozy and up-scale; with small round tables surrounded by tall couches to sit on. You can hang up your coat when you enter the door; and the hostess stands behind a large wooden whiskey barrel. It's a small restaurant; so it's better for dinner with a few friends or a date than large groups. The waiters are very friendly and attentive; and service is quick. All in all; a very pleasant dining experience! [REVIEW_8] Big shout out to Cecile for helping us load our plywood as we got ready for IRMA. Thanks so much! [REVIEW_9] I love this stand so much. The flowers are so vibrant and will last much longer than the regular store bought bouquet you find in supermarket.  They have a wide variety of flowers and many ways they can be arranged. Very affordable and attention to detail. The staff are friendly and helpful. From holiday parties to life events they always have something eye catching and meaningful that can be made to leave a lasting impression. [REVIEW_10] I have never been so insulted and talked down to in my life. Michelle; I think that's her name it's on my receipt but she never introduced herself; was the rudest person I have ever given my money to in my life. When we sat down she was talking about personal issues with the barback loud enough for us to hear and I thought that was odd in and off itself. When she gave us our menus she said a few times ""these menus are good for the next 30 seconds.""  Sorry but either give us brunch or give us dinner menus and explain that the kitchen is in the midst of a shift change; don't make us feel pressured because you dropped menus that have an extremely short time limit. Instead of eating we decided to just get drinks. She let us know that the brunch menu libations were; her words; 2 for 1. We ordered a mimosa off the list and hung out. When we got get drinks they set two wooden tokens down but didn't reference the at all; so we didn't know what they were for.  Eventually ordered some food off the dinner menu to go. She was very non existent the whole time we were sitting at the bar; not attentive at all. When we asked for the bill I saw that both our drinks were on there. I asked about them and let her know about the 2 for 1 statement she said. She then proceeded to tell me it was buy one; get one and that's what the tokens are for. I told her that ""buy one get one"" and ""2 for 1"" are different and if we knew it was BOGO we would have ordered another drink (if she would have even paid attention to us).  After a little back and forth she said she would take care of it and that ""they weren't trying to screw us.""  She talked to us like we were the worst people on earth because she doesn't know how to explain her own restaurants policies. I work in an industry that has me visiting 10-15 bars/restaurants/hotels a day and I have never had a worse hospitality experience in my life. Tavern Management - this employee is losing you revenue left and right.  Not only is she not taking care of customers and grabbing reorders; she is turning people away for good. This treatment was so horrible and off putting that I am going to go out of my way to recommended against going to Tavern due to the disrespect we felt. Hopefully your floor managers recognize how bad she is and theyo do something about it because she is taking money out of your pocket every shift she works. [REVIEW_11] I go here all the time for a quick bite to eat in the city. The food is fresh and there's a big variety. They offer good coffee; sandwiches; breakfast and even have a little grocery store with produce and frozen foods and much more. Super convenient and the staff is always very pleasant with a good sense of humor. They even offer a sandwich happy hour during the week. There is seating available as well [REVIEW_12] The BEST hotdogs around! No lie! I used to say down town LA or pinks Hotdogs were the best! But nope!  Daves dogs are BOMB! Plus he has something different on his (secret menu) every week!  Staff is really nice! I go at least once a week! [REVIEW_13] First time diner and I will definitely be back.  The food was awesome.  Best fried cheese and wings I've had in a while.  Shelby was our server.  She did a great job.  I'm looking forward to coming back next week.  I can't believe on Thursday tall PBR drafts are 2.50. [REVIEW_14] Great concept; perfect atmosphere; even better food.  What looks like a small corner store in Bywater opens up to a large courtyard in back with tables and torches strewn about seemingly haphazardly; like a friend might put together for a party on a Saturday night.   A stage in back houses an assortment of bands; and from my singular experience I will say the quality of music is exceptional. We saw a great jazz trio followed by a funk trio of organ/guitar/drums that was so good... Shout out to the drummer who had my jaw on the table all night. So tight and sublime.   To get to the courtyard you pass through the corner store full of wine; find a bottle that suits you; maybe some cheese or charcuterie; then head out back to find a table and park for a bit.  The food was better than either of our meals the previous two nights; and at half the price.   I had pork shoulder (in a broth born for sopping with good French bread); but honestly the chicken confit was the best plate of food I've tasted in a long time.   Olive oil cake is worth a taste for dessert.  Little cold this week so the heaters were out; which was great; but I'm looking forward to a warm sultry night here sometime in the near future! [REVIEW_15] Yessiree!!  This place is truly my new favorite place to eat in St. Petersburg!  Small and intimate; with a cool rustic elegant vibe.  We showed up at 6:15 with no reservation and walked right in. By 6:30 there was a line at the door and an hour wait. The menu offers an eclectic mix and it all looked amazing!  We had the short rib appetizer to start. Which was glazed in an Asian sauce with a little kick yum!!. My husband had pasta with a white sauce which I swear he hummed with delight thru every bite. I kept it simple with a burger which I was told would be life changing. They weren't kidding! I have dreamt of it nightly since our visit. Will I go back?  Hell yeah!  I'd camp out for this place !!",13
31,"[REVIEW_1] We love Philly and go every New Years Eve. We have experienced many hotels in the area ... this by far was our worst. The location is ok; not great. Their are some restaurants ( El Rey; continental) within walking distance. (walking distance to us is 5-10 blocks). The parking is $36 a day. The valet was polite and did there jobs. Front desk was nice and did there jobs as well. No issues with the staff. The lobby is misleading.The room size is average but the bathrooms are small and nonfunctional. The bed sucks no polite way to say it; first night I was up every hour due to the discomfort. REQUEST extra pillows! Was not super clean either in the bathroom. The rooms are not sound proff!!!! We could hear a couple fighting on top of us. To the point where we had to go to the lobby because we thought he was killing her. We could hear full conversations. Now this also explains the people who frequant the hotel.  This point is even more illistrate by the fact when we brought the fight to the attention of the staff they were not phased. I know it was New Years but listening to a girl getting choked out was not a good time actually it was a buzz kill. So we will never stay here again. [REVIEW_2] I had the WORST experience at this nail salon. I am not a local; visiting SB at the time. My cousin and I went to get our nails done; and I was simple just getting a polish change. The ""technician"" was an older woman; which is fine but she was very rude; unfriendly; sharp; and rough when grabbing my hand. She attempted to paint my nails; but it was pretty awful. It was a quick and sloppy job that she wanted to charge me $10 for. I asked to speak to the manager; just to see if I would get a discount or what; cause I really did not want that lady to re-do her poor job as she was very rude. The manager refused to speak to me face to face; but I could see her in the back. The woman who did my nails became upset very quickly and attempted to grab my hand and force me to let her re-do her first job. It was SO unprofessional; and at this point everyone in the salon was looking at this situation. I just wanted to leave and gave them the money. I have NEVER felt so mistreated at a business; and felt that the manager should have made more of an effort to make sure the customer left somewhat satisfied. I WOULD NOT recommend visiting this salon. [REVIEW_3] They have the WORST service advisors! Used to be good before Kelly and her team left. Unfortunately; it's convenient to work if I need oil change before I can make it to another Honda dealer. [REVIEW_4] Rude. Had me wait while they took other people. I just let my daughter get her nails done. I paid and she put my money on the counter and moved her head to look behind me to ask the lady she is ready. So I sat and watched her take the next lady and her money. Well she thanked her for business and gave her money in her hand bottom line. So now I can say it's a racist business!!!!! I watched them greet everyone and thank them for their business. BUT ME. They won't get another dollar from me or anyone I know. [REVIEW_5] Great food and great experience  This is a small restaurant with very talented cooks and great food! This is a great restaurant to seat down and just have few drinks and have a delicious meal. I took my wife here for a romantic dinner and I was not disappointed; and you will not be either. [REVIEW_6] OMG 2 PLUS hours after a b-ball game waiting for our order TONS of people after us have eaten and left and they lost our order and said ""Oh well we  don't have your order you have already  paid for; we have others ahead of you "". WTF NOOOOO we had our order placed first it's not our fault you lost it hours ago so make OURS!!!!!!! (They didn't. ).  They came at least an HOUR AFTER us.  Forget  this place.  The WORST service  I will NEVER come back and will highly NOT suggest this place.   The food came 3 hours later and the onion rings were cold (how could that be ?. Ribeye sandwich didn't taste great and was not worth 10.00   POOR SERVICE; food isn't great; dirty smelly restrooms & I had to clean our table no YUCK!!!!! DO NOT come here!!!! [REVIEW_7] Just got home from my LONG drive to Philadelphia PA. I had a house full of guests  and the general consensus for dinner was island cuisine. Unfortunately; I forgot that this is the Penn Relay weekend (huge mistake). After driving 1.5 hour and taking 30 minutes to find a $15 parking space; I finally arrived. The place was not too packed but half the patrons were gathered around the ordering counter. It took me a few minutes to realize that this increadibly roudy; vulgar bunch had aready placed their orders but were just hanging out at the counter; thus preventing newly arrived customers from placing their orders. I tried my best to get noticed and to get to the counter but had no luck. Ultimately; I and a few other customers (or should I say ""potential customers"" eventually gave up and left. The cincher for me was that the staff were clearly aware of what was occurring but made no attempt to control the crowd. I may have waited if the staff showed some business savvy and kept the counter area clear but unfortunately; they appeared overwhelmed and confused. i've eaten at the Jerk Hut several times (food is OK-good) but this visit left a bad taste in my mouth so I may have to reconsider future trips across the bridge for authentic JA CUISINE!! PS: Memo from prior visits; their wait staff can be a bit rude. [REVIEW_8] DO NOT GO HERE THEY ARE THE WORST  GO TO MASSAGE ENVY  IN MT LAUREL OR CHERRY HILL AND BE TREATED RIGHT  Hand & Stone is a money hungry thieving deceptive company. I had the worst massage at the Marlton location then as I went to pay with a Gift card that was given to me as a gift I was told by the rude receptionist that I had to pay $11.00 because my card had expired. SO I RECEIVED A TERRIBLE MASSAGE AND WAS RIPPED OFF FOR $ 11.00. I filled out a bad survey online then received a nasty email from the Manage her name is Jessika Morrow SHE WAS THE WORST I guess she feels it's ok to talk to customers like crap has horrible manager skills and should not have this position. when I said I would leave feedback as the worst place and massage I have ever had her response was I DON'T CARE DO WHAT YOU WANT... GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS The worst. I then called the Corporate Office and asked to speak to the Owners of the Franchise there names are Steve and Fred Vaccaro needless to say after leaving 3 messages for them to call me about this terrible situation they could have cared less to have called me to listen to my concerns. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO HAND & STONE AGAIN I GUESS THE $11.00 WAS WORTH LOSING A CUSTOMER KEEP IT UP AND YOU WILL BE HEADED WHERE KMART AND SEARS ARE GOING.....GREAT JOB JESSIKA WHAT A GEM... [REVIEW_9] We went with the simple choice and were not disappointed. Eggs; bacon and buttermilk pancakes. I can't put my finger on exactly what it was that made them so good; but the pancakes were divine! Worth it in our opinion! Even saw a girl from the voice while dining here! [REVIEW_10] Had a situation a few weeks ago where I needed emergency surgery and the Doctor at Urgent care recommended this hospital.  Having just moved here from a much smaller city; I was kind of scared of what a ""big city"" hospital would be like.  Boy was I wrong...  I went in through the ER; but Urgent Care had called ahead and let the hospital and surgeon know that I was coming.  We were greeted warmly by the ER staff and triaged right away.  They had all of my records; but still put me in the waiting room for a bit because they were pretty crowded and didn't have a bed for me yet.  They asked me a little bit later if I would mind being seen in the hall - at that point; I really didn't care if they yanked out my appendix in the bathroom so I said yes and was shown to a bed.  I am nosy enough that I enjoyed the location because I could nose on all of the comings and goings in the ER and it kept my mind busy while I was waiting for the surgeon.  He arrived and explained to me exactly what was going to happen and what a couple of follow-up scenarios were based on how my surgery went.    After surgery; which went fine; I was put on the 4th floor to recuperate.  I found out that all of their rooms are private rooms; which was nice.  I was in the hospital for 5 days; and could not have had a better experience.  Everyone I came in contact with (and I mean EVERYONE from the housekeeping staff to the doctors; nurses; techs and volunteers) treated me with kindness; patience; and respect.    I was there a couple of weeks ago...yesterday I received a get well card signed by all of the people who cared for me at Mercy!  Really a nice touch and just shows even more that they really care about their patients. [REVIEW_11] I would give this place negative stars if possible... and I would like to know when people actually went here!? Where were the short lines? The brilliant employees who made jokes and whimsically processed your organized paperwork? Where were the birds singing merrily?   1. There are never any parking spaces in the small parking lot.  2. The people here are the rudest people I have ever come across; and that factors in for the fact that they have to work at the DMV and deal with idiots all day  Let's see --first visit the person at the front desk turned me away because I didn't know you needed to bring a personal check or money order and wouldn't even let me get a number if didn't show her I had all my documents were ready to be processed- well I thought;  ok the website doesn't say you only take checks but OK; this is my fault and they mean business here!   Second visit I was told the wait was 2 hours - they are only open during the hours I work 8:30-4:30 so basically you have to miss work to go to the location in South Philly. I had to go back to work so I; yet again; assumed it was on me to figure out how to do this the right way. I'll try again; I told myself.  Third visit I was prepared - I had all my paperwork--took 2 hours off work- and I was told the wait was 1 hour 23 minutes. I'm going to do this!! I was number 748 and they were on number 730 when I sat down. Score! Over an hour later; the TWO people working there had only gotten through 4 people. One woman spent the whole time waiting on the same person who looked like he handed her a paperclip and a plastic bag and she made all kinds of calls to try to get his documentation (remember I can't even get in the building without showing mine)... the other person working there; while he was moving at a faster pace; took 2 people in a row who didn't have numbers. Then a man came over and said ""My sister so and so is coming"" and the woman nodded. 15 minutes later; the line hadn't moved at all and just before the man called the next number (number 735- still nowhere near me ) a woman comes up and announces she is so and so's sister and with no number; no line; no waiting; gets to go and give her paperwork in and was promptly waited on. Now; after 90 minutes and the line only moving 5 people my patience was wearing very thin. I complained about what was going on and I was told that ""oh honey those people were here earlier and lost their numbers"" OH YEA RIGHT. Then the woman finishes with ""paperclip no documents man"" and announces she is ""going on break"" and gets up and walks around and starts playing with so and so's sister's baby while she gets waiting on and the rest of us sit there like total fools.   I left and will never go back. If you no choice but to go to this location; take a day off work and get there as soon as they open. Also know that your number means nothing and the wait will be over 2 hours. And no one will be nice. Or try and make friends with someone who works there and that way you don't even need a number. [REVIEW_12] I would have rather put a hundred dollars down the toilet. Terrible food; prices and service.  This place is a joke. I emailed them many times to let them know how our experience was; only to have our emails returned undeliverable again and again. I own a business and I would have wanted to know how it was being run; employees not giving a hoot about the place; it's food or the most important...it's customers. It's a shame. Shame on them. [REVIEW_13] Had a really good time here. The staff was quick and friendly. We had the breakfast buffet which was really good and had a great selection. Definitely will be a place I recommend to my friends. [REVIEW_14] Ignorant bartender. Took forever for him to wait on you at a table on a Sunday afternoon; not even during football season.  Lesson learned. Never have a bartender wait on you for food.  Number 1; they don't want to do it; but also; they don't know the menu or anything about the kitchen when you ask a question. This is a typical suburban blue collar and millennial underwhelming establishment to watch Sports in with a pint of flat Budweiser. It is perfect for blue collars who swear that walk in dressed like they just finished a 10 hr day either painting; fixing drains; or laying down planks; or up on a roof. After 10 or 11pm the DB millennials roll in; espec on weekends. [REVIEW_15] Mark; the owner is almost always on site and is extremely helpful without falling in to  the pushy category. I'm a man that has a difficult time putting things together to make an outfit and Mark will pull a number of pants; jeans; shirts; belts; shoes; ties; sweaters; hats and even a cool scarf and tell you what works together to really ""make an outfit"". Prices are reasonable in that he often has a promotion going and I'm happy to pay for great service. 5 stars.",5
32,"[REVIEW_1] Love coming to this place for a quick bite. There Indian tacos are really good as are there regular tacos!! [REVIEW_2] My wife recently attended an event here held by the UCSB Arts&Lectures program. The personnel and volunteers were very efficient and helpful; they communicated and worked very well with one another and with the public. The venue was clean and attractive. The event went smoothly; thanks to the great organizational skills of all involved. [REVIEW_3] Nice food but don't go to this place when their busy time; such as brunch time:))    After we ordered about half hour; our food still not show up and we ask the server that we waiting long time. You know what; our server told us ""you guys only waited 22 mins."" WHat the hell is that answer supposed to be???!!!!  And we ask separate check the guy said ""we dont do separate check when we are busy."" :)) Well... i dont offer tip when you busy then:)))) Who fking cares!! [REVIEW_4] Slum Lords of the worth kind.  Don't expect your security deposit back. If you so much as put a hole in the wall to hang a picture they will charge you for damaging the property. They will lie and say you broke things; and the place was trashed in order to keep your security deposit. They will basically try to get as much money out of you as they can. If you try to pay online that will cost a fee; but they won't tell you; just so they can get more money.  They also do not upkeep their properties well. Our roof leaked and the air conditioning didn't work. They would not replace it or pay someone properly to fix the roof. They are slum lords of the worth. They will take your money and claim you ruined their place without proper evidence. Do not trust them. I don't care how bad you need a place; they will mistreat you and steal your security deposit. You have been warned! [REVIEW_5] I visited this store a few months ago; and they were extremely friendly.  Bought my new phone there.   If I lived in that area; I would only visit this store.  However; I visited a location in Texas as the service was terrible.  This Sparks location was worth my trip and purchase experience.  thanks [REVIEW_6] Had a great time out with the girls! The instructor was super patient with these non-artistic painters. Everything somehow turned out the way it should look. Great time! Definitely recommended!! [REVIEW_7] Still a Great experience. Worth going out of your way to try. Food is excellent supurb service. They take great pride in their product; and it shows at every level. Do NOT MISS the incredible bakery! [REVIEW_8] Tonight I was really disappointed. I called and placed a take out our about 45-1hr prior to closing. I ordered a chicken Fajita and chicken enchiladas with chips and dip. The only thing right was the chips and dip; if you count that each chip was broke then maybe not. I should have taking pics of this mess I was given but I was to upset once I drove all the way home only to realize my order was WRONG and MISSING.. had no black beans and rice or sides for my enchiladas. You could barley see any cheese. I called immediately and spoke with the manager and was told that the enchiladas would been taken off my bill. No dinner than I hung up and opened the burrito I noticed I had no fajita peppers... none just rice beans and chicken..  I immediately called back. The manager agreed that the orders were wrong and she apologized and asked if I was close she would have the order remade; and take the entire order off my bill. Since I was feeding more than myself; I decided that I would return for the remade order so my teenager would eat tonight as planned. Well.. I drive 10 minutes back and get my remade order and another apology. The worse part about this is I should have cut my losses... but this is the same place that I hosted by friends Bridal shower in the private dining hall and the service was amazing; this is the same place that I have come for happy hours but tonight I should have said NO!! Get home and bam.. burrito smelled great looked great but NO Chicken.. NONE.. just beans; peppers; rice and cheese even tasted the cilantro but Where is the Chicken?? I didn't bother to call back this time. I'm gonna just cut my losses and not go back. Not a good feeling when you really want something tasty to get and get turned off Twice!! My nephew agrees.. he just went to Wendy's. Now I hope my refund is correct. Seems likely the next problem. [REVIEW_9] Where to begin; a $ 7 tip was added to my bill prior to Svc rendered. Shouldn't that be my choice. It is a gratuity is it not? My order took over 2 hours to arrive. When the gentleman arrived he did apologize for the delay. The reason I have never heard before. He told me a coworker took his car to p/u his/her daughter from school. That's a new one. So as you see; 2 hour delay does not = a $7 gratuity; nor does it = more than 1 star. [REVIEW_10] Wonderful experience! Kelly at the front counter was more than helpful. We do a lot of traveling for work and I must say she did an exceptional job helping us find food around the area and almost acting as a tour guide. Her service was more than appreciated and we will definitely recommend staying here. Clean rooms; great service and shuttle bus driver was extremely friendly and helpful as well! [REVIEW_11] Michael and Chris were great! It was easy to book the tour and the Michael took us out on a tour; we saw Dolphins; homes; see life and spent time exploring an island. I can't wait for the next time we visit Clearwater I will certainly take the tour again. Keep in mind that if you are a beginning jet skier let them know so they can put you with other beginners. [REVIEW_12] This used to be my go-to spot for mani and pedis; mostly because it was very close to my home. I moved to port Richmond about 6 years ago and about a year ago this place was taken Over by ""new management"" and completely changed and at all for the better.   When they first switched over the new owner would offer you champagne or wine and made promises of what else was to come. For example They offered your own tools to you if you were a frequent client ; and punch cards for rewards. However ; I watched the quality of this place go right down the drain. The service became slow and less accommodating. There's no way I could get out of there in under an hour mostly due to the inexpirienced techs who I felt were winging it. I started getting the worst work and have since moved on. Stay out of there locals ; there's way better shops out there! [REVIEW_13] Here is a tea review. Yup; a tea review for Bittersweet!   Tea tea tea. This is our second time here 5 years apart. Super nice service both times.   Now; he (I assume the owner) brews iced tea over 12 to 16 hours. It is really good; really; really good. You can tell he takes pride in this tea and his establishment.  This time; I also had a fantastic almond croissant. The white icing is wonderful. Should have bought two the husband took way too much from his ""bite."" In the past we had cupcakes and also really enjoyed these.  We will be back on our next NOLA visit for certain. [REVIEW_14] So they renovated the place and now it has more counter space. I thought now they possibly can fit in more baristas and improve the quality of the drinks. But I was deeply DISAPPOINTED again. We ordered two lattes; and the barista steamed the milk in a big pitcher then poured out both of them at once. So instead of two lattes; we got one has too much milk form like a cappuccino; and another one is basically hot coffee-flavored milk without much form. I would go to Joes or Elixir nearby instead. [REVIEW_15] Went here to redeem Groupon; frist time staff member said she couldn't use system and for me to come back after she extended it. I went back and I was told I was out of luck it expired.  Way to waste my time and very un-Yoga like. I will stick with Wake up Yoga and PSC; they know how to treat people.",8
33,"[REVIEW_1] The first time I visited the Deli I wanted to order everything off the menu. Our group ordered four different sandwiches; and all were delicious! They were very filling! They also have great blues music! This place was so packed on a Thursday night (no room to sit) so I would suggest getting here very early! I plan on going back; possibly for lunch so I can sit down! GREAT place! [REVIEW_2] I had been wanting to try this place for a while as it was really close to my internship. It's a cute; tiny spot that seems good for getting a few hours of work done or even just chilling. The crowd when I walked in was mixed; it included a man busy at his computer as well as a mom & her child enjoying breakfast. A couple others came in and out while I was ordering as well.   I was really impressed with the beautifully crafted ""Lucky Goat"" latte I ordered...Dark chocolate; hazelnut; sea salt! It was delicious The barista was also patient and nice as I looked over what to order. I would definitely be back to try the other special drinks which all sounded amazing or try some of the fresh baked pastries. I'm also curious about the iced coffee.  One suggestion I'd have is for them to update their website! The website still lists fall specials and I know they have a couple of new drink specials every season! I'll be back soon to try more items off the menu! [REVIEW_3] Came here for brunch at 1 on a Saturday while visiting from out of town. Drinks are good but come out slow and it took over an hour to bring out our appetizer The service is really slow. Our server seemed very overwhelmed but the restaurant wasn't even packed. On a Saturday afternoon with nice weather there should probably be more servers working. Tables are left messy and we actually had to wipe the food off of our table ourselves.  I ordered the steak and eggs and when I asked our server if the eggs could be prepared over easy instead of scrambled; she said she didn't know because they pre scramble the eggs in the morning...  When our food came out it was atrocious. I am appalled that the kitchen would even send it out in the state that it was. 1 burger had an eggshell on it and the other had cold congealed cheese and the bun was twice the size of he burger. The steak and eggs were the size of a side. And the eggs were scrambled...  Advice to management- hire bussers and greet people as they walk in... It's not always obvious when you should seat yourself. Also isn't fair for servers to have to have to apologize for management and kitchen staff not doing their jobs right.  After all was said and done; management gave us $10 gift cards which didn't even cover the cost of our drinks and even our server said 'this is bullshit'. [REVIEW_4] Just recently ate here for the first time. The hype was real. My girlfriend had the Greek Salad while I ordered the Chickpea Vegetarian Pita and they were kind enough to allow for some substitutions. The food was on point and portions were very filling and satisfying. Great staff and environment. Will definitely be back again! [REVIEW_5] Fantastic food and very reasonably priced. I got the mahi mahi tacos and they were excellent. I could have eaten half a dozen of them. [REVIEW_6] Braving the twisting road and hiking down to get there (NO parking.)we were met with a what i will call; THE REST STOP. If your idea of a ""Special Night"" out involves sitting in the dirt on tree stumps watching LA poseurs vaping after all-day wine binging sounds fun; this is your kinda place. Their walk-in hut offers beer only; no place inside to sit and relax. The outdoor BBQ sandwiches feed the crowd as they stare at the road to see who arrives next. The band was good; but were crammed into a corner of the dirt; near the beer hut with no dance floor.The only place of solace is the Tavern itself; and a charming respite from the outside. My ribs were tasty; but my husband's fish entre was a big disappointment. The servers were tense feeding the crowd on a holiday weekend. In short; I will never be back. The whole vibe just sucked. [REVIEW_7] We made reservations; and were seated upstairs about a foot from the band at a table that seemed more like a bar table. After sitting for 45 min with NO SERVICE; just empty glasses and silverware; we left. While leaving the host kindly insisted to grab the manager after we told her what happened. (The hosts were wonderful!)   The manager did nothing besides essentially say that this wasn't typical and to come back. [REVIEW_8] Rude and impatient while going through the drive thru. It was an inconvenience to ask Monica any kind of question. Won't be back. If you don't like your job work somewhere else. [REVIEW_9] Don't go here. They gave me grief over the groupon then didn't bother to actually change my oil filter or tell me that they hadn't changed it so I drove 5k miles on an old filter. Crappy customer service; rude attitude; find somewhere better. [REVIEW_10] I've never seen a larger or better selection of beer in my life! All are sold by the bottle; and the prices are awesome! The employees are always happy to help and greet you with a genuine smile. Little known- this place also serves sandwiches; panini's and wraps. The different choices are sometimes exotic; but alway delicious. But if you know what you want; you can always ""create your own"" any way you want it. If you're on the run; you can get anywhere from this location. Or- just grab a table! Enjoy a beer or two with your sandwich and see what's up and coming in the local community. I love this place. [REVIEW_11] Best steaks around!   The atmosphere and service was wonderful.  I would only recommend to go after 8pm due to the limited seating available.   My personal favorite was the 10 .oz filet. [REVIEW_12] Horrible service! They asked us to put the baby carrier on the floor instead of giving us a bigger table. Are you kidding? I felt completely guilty to have suggested the place. Unbelievably lousy service. Never again! [REVIEW_13] Wonderful; amazing; awesome convenience store. Best soft pretzels; great sandwiches; breakfast; breakfast burritos; chicken finger bowls over mac and cheese; drinks; teas; lemonades... I love it. I wish these were in California and/or New England. [REVIEW_14] Best sushi around. Always fresh and outstanding! They have some great and different signature rolls. [REVIEW_15] The waitstaff were attentive and very nice! That is the only positive comment that I have for this establishment: I waited fir over an hour while moderate celebrities were ushered in. After all of the waiting the food was not good. Grits were hard and not seasoned; shrimp & fish over cooked; it was a disappointment.",8
34,"[REVIEW_1] Everything about this place was wonderful. The waitress was lovely and I loved the architecture. The food was amazing! I had a salad and green beans which were probably one of the greatest things I've ever had before. I definitely recommend coming here. Everyone is so nice! They even brought free dessert because they look so long on our order even though it wasn't long at all! Definitely come here! [REVIEW_2] Listen; I can even take my meat-eating parents here without a hitch; so they've gotta be doing something right. I have encountered almost zero disappointment at this place. I've been vegan for almost 10 years now; lived all over; and this is the best vegan take-out joint I've EVER been to.   My favourites are probably the Crispy HipCity Ranch ('chickn' burger); Ziggy Burger (tempeh); Jerk Caesar Salad; Green Lemonade and sweet potato fries... my Philly-native husband loves the cheesesteak.  I love salad but couldn't get into the udon and spinach salads (could have just been the service that day---few toppings on either). Definitely don't make up your mind about this place until you've tried a burger! [REVIEW_3] Extremely competent; prompt and upfront and fair about price. Had an issue that required trouble shooting; some general repairs and adding outlets done to my complete satisfaction. I will use them a gain and give my highest recommendation. [REVIEW_4] Beware of smiling Joe! We bought living room furniture from him. We trusted him. He told us that once furniture was delivered it would be harder to return; however; he didn't say it couldn't be returned--just harder. When I called to tell Joe two of the furniture pieces weren't going to fit and we needed to exchange; he said ""oh; let me talk to customer service and call you back."" I let two days pass and called him back since he didn't return my call. The person that answered phone asked if they could give Joe a message; I said yes; that they could tell him I wanted him to call me back like he said he was going to do. Within 2 minutes my phone was ringing; but it wasn't Joe. I think she said her name was Madilyn; not sure. She said that she was just calling to tell me there are no returns or exchanges. I told her that Joe had said it was hard and the paperwork just says Ashley reserves the right to refuse returns but it doesn't say they won't. She proceeded to rudely and condescending ly say that she could read the paper to me. I told her thanks but I know how to read.   It's sad that some Ashley employees in Clearwater Florida are rude and intentionally mislead what would have been ongoing customers. Our home is new and we need more furniture. However; we will now look for a more reputable company to give our money to. Hope it was worth it smiling Joe and condescending customer service person [REVIEW_5] When the boss is away; the kids will take a little bit longer lunch hour and venture to Broad Ripple to eat somewhere they've wanted to try for a long time!  I can't believe I didn't make it here sooner.  I don't know which I liked better; the owner or the ham croqueta sandwich.  He was super friendly; making sure to talk to everyone and was happy he didn't have to deport anyone for not liking his food; which I don't think is possible.  The sandwich was bigger than I expected and loaded.  There was more ham on it than I normally eat at Christmas dinner; yet at the end; I was somehow wanting more.  The black bean soup was the perfect side dish.  Pro tip: check out coupons4indy.com before you go!  Can't wait til next time! [REVIEW_6] This place has gone downhill since they opened few months ago. They need to improve cleanliness big time. [REVIEW_7] Amazing place! Great for kids and there is a sandbox they can play at. People were nice the nachos w chili were good . Mostly the atmosphere fire pit and seats by the ocean were our favorite [REVIEW_8] We had another outstanding meal at J Gilbert's. Sunday is half price wine night so we started with a great red wine. The calamari appetizer was tender and delicious. We ordered 2 versions of the filet combo. One with crab cake and one with scallops. Both were excellent. Grilled asparagus was perfect and the Lobster Mac and cheese and the au gratin potatoes were decadent sides. You can't go wrong with any of the entrees here. I do not know why it wasn't busier! [REVIEW_9] UPDATE to my used car purchase ..... it's been a little over a month; and the detailers wax and scratch remover has started to wear off; and wouldn't you know; scratches EVERYWHERE on the hood and trunk. Deliberately hidden by a professional detail job..... you seriously need to hate yourself if you are going to buy a car here. I guess this is why they were so hell bent on selling a dings; dents; and scratches warranty. [REVIEW_10] Great choice in a small shop. Worth the drive. The wine cakes are excellent! Just went here for first time based on yelp reviews and will definitely be going back [REVIEW_11] Though top notch service is demanded at a JW; I was thoroughly impressed with the property; service; and staff.   I only had two complaints. One was the noise level as there was an outdoor concert until 11pm. The other was the below average bartender at velocity during lunch. Nothing terrible; but lacked enthusiasm and desire to give good service. Obviously the concert wasn't the hotel's fault. The bartender issue wasn't worth dropping the rating a star.   Overall; the GM of the hotel seems as though he/she has it together. Thanks to all the staff for a nice stay. [REVIEW_12] If I could give zero stars I would. I never ever have had such an experience at an establishment. I came here with a group of 8 for a birthday dinner. We had more than 1 server. I have no idea what any of their names were. They give NO REFILLS on anything (soda; tea; lemonade; etc) which I think is insane! So they recommend buying a pitcher. The pitchers and ice bucket were both in plastic containers you can get from the dollar store.   We wait nearly 2 hours for our food. Majority of our party ordered mac & cheese as a side. Once we got our plates we noticed their was shrimp in our mac & cheese. When we questioned our server; she responded ""Oh I thought she told you we ran out"". Mind you; that is completely fine; but what if someone had a seafood allergy?   To top it off; 2 of our party members (birthday girl included) did not receive their meals. They didn't even check back at the table until we flagged them down to report the missing plates. Our server then responded; ""I honestly don't even know what you ordered"". We didn't even finish our food and the birthday girl didn't even want to eat them to even bother making her food since we had waited so long and they were closing. We asked to speak to a manager and was told they would come. When they didn't; we asked again. At this time; our ""server"" (the same one we asked to get a manager) claimed she was the manager. WHICH WE KNEW WAS A LIE.   I understand they have just opened but theres no way an establishment should be run this way. Our entrees came out on glass plates; but everything else was on paper plates.   I WOULD NOT recommend this establishment to anyone. They didn't apologize or seem interested in good customer service. [REVIEW_13] five stars because it is a casino. They have lots of slots.. everything from a nickel and UP! I play the unicorn slot machine because it reminds me of the unicorns; my favorite band. I usually walk away with the same amount of $ I spent-- I make enough to buy a round of drinks.  Brittney Mullen is the best cocktail waitress. She is the fastest and nicest cocktail waitress ever. Request her many times. [REVIEW_14] Great place for a large gathering. I was there for a private party and they have a great space for it. The cocktail menu is very good; and the good is great - would reccomend the black forest chocolate cake if you like chocolate. [REVIEW_15] What a dive! It took the new owners no time to return Kelly's back to its dive status of yesteryear. The food is so-so. It's dumpy and smelly. The floor is sticky. The tables and chairs are a mess. The silverware is grungy. Not fit for anyone but drunken college kids Best to go to a restaurant if you want to keep your appetite and eat. This is just a place to watch kids puke out front; if that's what you;re into.",10
35,"[REVIEW_1] ""Feather free"" in my profile.  ""Feather free"" in my reservation.  ""Feather free"" by special request when I called four hours before arrival.  ""Feather free"" confirmed upon check in.  In the room?  Feathers.  Will Hyatt ever understand how important this is?  Will it take another trip to the emergency room?   And $29/night to park also absurd for St. Louis.  ""Sorry about that sir"" gets old. [REVIEW_2] I've been 3 times; so I think I can share a fair judgement.  This business is a lot of show; without the go.   Service has been the overall department that has been completely lacking along with some breakfast items are products of horrible cooking.  First time: asked for black coffee and a matcha latte; dad didn't get his coffee until our food already arrived (which also seemed to take forever) and I actually never received my matcha latte after asking and reminding waiters more than eight times; 8!!! It got to be comical; which is why we counted.  By the end of our breakfast they finally offered it to me in it as a to go drink and still had the audacity to charge me for it; so I said no.  Second visit; was dinner with friends; this was a much more pleasant experience; there was four of us; we shared a bottle of wine and I remember I liked my food. No complaints here. Third time; was another breakfast round... I'm not sure what it is about breakfast but I don't think they do a good job for breakfast. To start with; we were given menus for both breakfast and lunch; which was appreciated; but no drink menus and we were specifically interested in mimosas or Bloody Mary's etc. because we didn't know what to order; or what was our options were... my dad ordered a Bloody Mary; and I ordered a Mimosa. I only mention this because it was frustrating to see other people have different variations of mimosas and also bloody mary's; other breakfast cocktails which we didn't even know existed.  My dad ordered a ham and cheese omelette with his side of home fries. I ordered the power bowl muesli.  We got through two drinks before the food came; which actually was a long time. By the time our food came; the order was wrong - my dad had fruit; but no home fries as he requested.  We immediately let our server know; and she said she would go grab them.  Additionally; our plates were extremely bland.  Just an omelette; no garnish or sides at all (other than the fruit in the side bowl.  The plates just looked sad.  Also; I could tell by looking at the omelette it wasn't good; that's how bad it was; and my dad concurred.  The wait staff failed to bring his home fries in any kind of fast or quick manner; so we reminded our bartender; who then reminded to server; once my dad got a refill on his coffee we also then reminded that server as well.  We ate through the entire meal; never got the home fries; and in the end right as our check was being delivered we mentioned the homefries again; and that's when the bartender sent a server running for them; and as we were signing our check is when they came out and were offered as a ""to go"" option.  While a simple side; it was really disappointing to go the entire breakfast with an awkward feeling of  ""I guess they just don't care"" and instead of comping anything; the manager offered me a $15 off coupon the next time we came in.  It's just hard to ever want to come in again... and didn't feel like an adequate apology on a $45 breakfast.  And lastly my dads omelette tasted like McDonalds.  Only upside was that my muesli power bowl was delicious; just hard to believe it took as long as it did to come out or that anything cost as much as it did with as horrible of service and lack of ""care"" put behind anything that was done there. [REVIEW_3] This is my first ever yelp review; because I thought that Albert's was so fantastic and deserves the good review and hopefully future business. I rented a 14-passenger van to take us from Mt. Laurel to Philly and back for a bachelorette party. The price was the most affordable we found. The staff were always quick to get back to me and flexible when we needed to change our pick-up time. Our driver; Jay; showed up on time; was patient with us throughout the night as we bounced around to different places; and so incredibly friendly. We couldn't have been happier! Definitely go with Albert's. [REVIEW_4] A disclaimer: I only had their beer; did not dine here.  I think this was the best brewery we went to on a three day trip to Tucson; and coincidentally it was the busiest one. Finding a seat here took some serious time but one thing we did notice is that no matter how busy they were; the servers were always available and ready to help. There was no feeling whatsoever that we were being rushed; or couldn't get service. It was just that everyone was good at their jobs!  The NCAAle; an English Strong Ale; was glorious. Nothing like a 10oz glass of strong ale to wake you up when you get that 2:30 feeling from your sugar crash. The patio is a nice place to sit and offers a nice view of the Tucson ""skyline"" while you drink. Loved this place! [REVIEW_5] This place was awful. I went because it was the only place open late at night. Burger and fries were horrible and I got an apple pie which tasted like it came out of a refrigerated box. [REVIEW_6] Still my favorite Roast Beef Poor Boy in the city! Bring your wet-naps; you're going to need them! Hot Roast Beef and an ice cold Dixie; Ahhhh; that's living. [REVIEW_7] So I've only had delivery; so I know the food has to be even better when its fresh. Cheese steak with provolone was awesome. The steak was tender. [REVIEW_8] We have been using Robert since he walked around our neighborhood starting his business about 7 or 8 years ago.  He is always responsive; does a great job and makes my yard something I don't worry about.  He does the spring turn on; sends guys to fix broken sprinklers; does PHENOMENAL clean up when I ask; shuts down and winterizes the yard and truly; truly loves what he does. If you let him do his job you will be thrilled.  I don't ever worry about my dogs being let out and he is familiar with both of them!!!  He is honest; hard working and his crew is great.  If you are in need of a great service Keeping it Green and Robert are your company.  He also sells Christmas trees and we just love him.  There is no one better!!!! [REVIEW_9] Red Lobster used to be THE place to go back in the day; even more so if you were landlocked with no access to seafood. But sadly; it's just become a shell of its former glory. The lobster tank was the perfect metaphor for today's experience; vacant cold and empty.  Despite this one star review I think our server Ryan was great. He was personable; friendly and proactive. You do the best you can with which you are given.  Cleanliness: 0 stars. Our table appeared clean but I came to discover that no it's not the table varnish peeling off; it's in fact grease of some nature; most likely butter. The crumb catchers in the booth were full of crumbs and food particles; the menu could have used a wipe down and the silverware was spotty. Even worse were the implements served with the appetizers. The spoon with the lobster and artichoke dip had dried food stuck to it and the greasy mussel spoon had fallen into the broth before getting to the table. The to go boxes had fingerprints all over them and the entree plates weren't much better.  Food quality and taste: 1 star. Food was served hot and in a timely fashion but quality was low. My salad was comprised of ice burg lettuce which is par for chain restaurants; though every piece I received was white. The cherry tomatoes were soft; not firm and the carrot shavings were dry and discolored like they had been sitting around awhile. The mussels were very strong in taste; and not in a good way. I ate only two out of fear that they might not agree with me later. The broth was garlicky and delicious and the lobster artichoke dip was also quite good.  The stuffed flounder entree was served with asparagus cooked within an inch of its life. Limp; and fibrous. The flounder was a very small filet served over the seafood stuffing that had crab shell in it. I didn't finish the small portion because I officially decided today that no matter what or how I try fish; I just don't like it.  Overall; a pretty anticlimactic lunch date served with a side of disappointment. I hope Ryan either makes a lot of money somehow or has plans on going to a better restaurant in the future. [REVIEW_10] Best sushi I have ever had; in my life. One of my favorite restaurants. This sushi is what dreams are made of!! The rolls and sauces are so unique and taste amazing. They are on the pricier side compared to your average sushi restaurant; but not by much. We are talking a $1-$3 increase per roll at Sakana. That few dollars is well worth the quality; taste; and experience a million times over. The rolls at Sakana are larger and more full of fish as well; so I get full faster. I cannot rave enough about this place. There's sometimes a long wait; because it is a small restaurant but it is worth it. Try going right at opening (5:00 on weekends) to be sat right away. Also- Merry Go Round Roll. You won't be disappointed. [REVIEW_11] IF YOU ARE FEMALE & YOUNG; GO SOMEWHERE ELSE  I dropped off my car and told them I needed my oil change. They were very friendly and said they would have it done quickly; which was appreciated. When I came back to pick up my car three hours later; they charged me $75 dollars for the oil change. The guy working the counter could tell I was shocked (an oil change at the dealer usually costs $35).  He explained they had used synthetic oil. When I asked why they would give me synthetic oil when I didn't ask for it; he gave me some BS answer that it was standard for Toyotas. Since he could tell I was upset; he said they were running a special and knocked down the price by 25%.   I am aware that I am a young woman and that I don't know much about cars but I do not appreciate being taken advantage of. I will be going elsewhere for car maintenance from now on.  Wish I had read the reviews before trying out this Firestone. It looks like other women have had the same experience in the past. [REVIEW_12] This was by far my favorite Cuban sandwich of all the Cubans I've had to date. We were treated to a free coffee after the meal as well as a spin of the wheel which led to a free dessert. Over all the experience was excellent.  I can't wait to go there again. [REVIEW_13] Great surprise sushi place. The miso soup was the best we have ever had; the house salad was actually good. I ordered Dinner Box A which came with four different items which three were fantastic and the steak over vegtables just ok. So we ordered more food. One eel and one tuna. That was amazingly fantastic. wow. I am really liked the sound of the waterfall. [REVIEW_14] Please do not bring your loved one to this hospital; they use their patients as guinea pigs and staff have little regard for the privacy and dignity of patients even if they require critical care! My auntie is struggling to stay alive and when my mom stayed with her just two days ago mom had to stand in the room with her the entire time because there were no chairs. When she asked the nurse for a chair the nurse rudely responded that they couldn't accomodate everyone in the hospital. We are looking into transferring my auntie out of this terrible place. [REVIEW_15] FOOD IS AMAZING! And the service is great! I had breakfast and an item from the daily specials menu and they did not disappoint. They were busy at 11 AM and our food was still out in less than 10 minutes. Will come back here again for sure!!",9
36,"[REVIEW_1] This place is a joke. Always had been. Nickel and Dime you. I worked here for 10 years and was let go after the flood for no reason other than we don't need you anymore. Employees are nothing more than a number. [REVIEW_2] Our son & his wife sent us the heart shaped box of chocolate covered strawberries with a 'Happy Anniversary' balloon for our 50th wedding anniversary this past Saturday. The store called to make sure we were home; the driver wished us a happy anniversary and the strawberries are still delicious and keeping well in the fridge. I would definitely send these to someone else. Well worth the price. [REVIEW_3] It's all about the cannoli! Don't try to share it- it won't work. You need to order your own. I'd love to try some of their other baked goods but I can't get past that freshly made; perfectly crunchy shell with the amazing not-to-sweet; creamy chocolatey chip filling. It's worth the hassle of trying to find parking and walking sideways to cut through the Reading Terminal crowds. [REVIEW_4] My husband and I ate here today.  I ordered the BLT with avocado-it was so delicious!  My husband ordered the chili cheese hamburger-the portion was huge!  The best thing about this cafe is the French fries!  These are homemade fries that are so delicious.  We didn't get a milkshake because we couldn't eat another bite.  They looked so good!  Next time we will get one meal and share a shake. [REVIEW_5] After strings of a variety of different restaurants in the same building; this one I think is a keeper!  The bar area has lots of TV's for the sports freaks. The more important part; the bar is stocked with good selection of draft beer; tons of local products; great cocktail selection and knowledgeable bartenders. They can whip up something great and customize it with however your heart desires.  As for the food; they have a really good selection and reasonably priced. The cheese curds are great and the Bavarian pretzel is ginormous.  The entrees are good from meat; seafood and pasta selections. It's an American standard fare and they put some spins on some items such as their Americanized orange chicken who his actually pretty decent with their jasmine rice.   They also have a kids menu. My son loves their chicken tenders and fries. Don't expect pink slime on their chicken. It's the real deal and how they seasoned it is pretty good.   They have daily specials. Probably my fave will be the bottomless mojitos on Mondays. [REVIEW_6] Butch did a great job. The tour was relaxing; informative but 2 good stops to eat and see the cemetery. I recommend going on this trip the beginning of your stay so you know where to go during your trip. He'a also pretty fun. [REVIEW_7] Seriously I love this theater! You can go on Tuesdays for 1.50 and something like 3.50 on other days. It is the ""cheap theater"". This is where they show you movies that have been out for a while. And WOW. I cannot believe this is the cheap theater. It is so nice! The screens are big; the sound and lighting and chairs and everything is just what it should be: comfortable; clean; and nice. I have been to many cheap theaters in my life and this is by far the best. I just wish it was closer to me! The Oracle cheap theater is closer to me; but by a long shot; this one is better. If it was closer I would go to movies all the time!   Another plus; everyone there is friendly and the parking lot is huge. If this is close to you and you like movies; you should be here! [REVIEW_8] the employees were all nice and respectful to their customers. I rented out a two-people kayak for $30; and we were allowed to ride it for 3 hours; which is a pretty decent deal. I paddled the kayak around the port. it's a great place to kayak because there are areas where the waves are calm; and if you want; you can go out into the ocean and ride along the shores. I also saw seals just relaxing on a deck; which was a cool experience (wished i brought my phone to take pictures). Overall; it was a fun activity to do; especially during a warm sunny day :D [REVIEW_9] Went here for Valentines Day with my boyfriend and we both loved it. The food was great and the wait staff were wonderful. I had never eaten Indian before (unlike my boyfriend) but our waiter was very helpful and even got me a more mild Chicken Tikka Masala and helped my boyfriend out with his order. Both were very delicious. The waiter even gave us some fresh nan on the house which was also very good. Overall I think this place needs more recognition; it seemed very un-busy for a Saturday holiday. Will definitely go again; 5 stars. [REVIEW_10] I am writing this based on the concert/bar only.  We went to the Eddie Money concert and chose the General Admission tickets.  The VIP seats appeared to be very well placed for viewing.  Unless you arrive at least an hour early and wait at the rail constantly; or you are well over 6 ft; you will have a hard time seeing anything.  The stage is raised above the VIP crowd nicely; but appears to be level with the G/A crowd.  This leaves over 90% of the General Admission patron with a very 'limited view'.  I am 5' 11"" and could see the band from the neck up about 60% of the time.  I would guess that men under 5' 10"" and almost every woman not in the front spent most of the show watching on a screen to the side that had the resolution of a pizza parlor. The wait staff was understaffed and less than efficient.  The security staff was just down right RUDE.  The sound was nice.  Eddie Money was great.  But in the non-VIP area; the concert layout and the service left much to be desired. It might not be fair that a concert rating affects the restaurant rating; but if you choose to have concerts in your restaurant... [REVIEW_11] I would give it zero stars if I could; but yelp obviously doesn't like that. First; if you want to call this dealership the operator acts like the secretary of the CEO; and doesn't want to connect you to talk to anyone. Then she gives you a lecture about how things are handled. She finally connected me; after telling her she can keep the car if this call doesn't get anywhere very soon. Working with Lance was a pleasure. When it came to pick up the car we were informed that due to internal commission problems we would have to receive the car from Tony now as he was the first point of contact even though he wasn't at work or had any part in the deal at any time. Turned out he didn't even know what car we bought. When voicing my displeasure about having to work with someone else; John Hartman; the assistant general manager; just gave a rude answer asking what car we were picking up. Dealing with Crown GMC was a pleasure in the past; but with Hyundai not so much; yet the price made me not walk away at this point. I can only suggest to take your business elsewhere if you expect to be treated with respect. After signing all the paperwork the promised navigation turned out to be non existent. [REVIEW_12] If you like lobster this is the place. Great prices great service and great food. Very casual dining.  Back again to enjoy the Lobster special w 1  1/4 lb lobster;1 # mussels and 1-2# steamers with corn and potatoes for $19.99. See photo.  Clam chowder so good as is the Ucon lobster roll covered in melted butter. [REVIEW_13] What a happy mistake it was to randomly run into this place while exploring the Garden District in New Orleans. The donuts were out of this world (I can't believe they have new ones everyday)! I was with a group and we split a few; so we could try a selection. Would DEFINITELY recommend stopping by! [REVIEW_14] Looking for a hard to find book January 9 for a one year wedding anniversary for my wife that I bought a KitchenAid mixer for. The special KitchenAid mixer cookbook showed in-store availability; yes I know how to search within a store to see if it's actually there. I pick the store; I checked the availability within that store. It said in stock limited quantities. I'm only a half hour from there but it was rush-hour traffic. I get there and looked everywhere for the book. And I do mean looked everywhere. I finally gave in to ask someone to search for this books location or these books; this guy behind the information desk said I'm looking in the warehouse not in the store... I showed him where it says this particular store in store in stock etc. complete with store number and address. He continued to argue with me that it just means warehouse; it just means it's in the warehouse; it's just in the warehouse;.! Seriously? If something says available in a particular store and in stock with a green check mark next to it that means for all you people out there don't waste your time trusting it-go to Barnes and Noble. I can't believe how stupid these people are by goading people to come into the store just to create more floor traffic! I will never frequent the store again and I will make sure this review makes it to every Internet site I can put it on. I was seriously pissed off at their lies! Yes I know it's only a book; But I sat and googled every possible bookstore all over the place and that was my closest possible store to pick it up especially during rush hour traffic. I must say these people are serious douche bags.! [REVIEW_15] I've been to Gilley's many times and love how they have it set up. You could get lost in there which I did trying to find my way out. Haha if you come to Gilley's give yourself a few hours it's big and lots to see and buy. They even have a flea market outside on certain days.  You'll love this store mark my words.",11
37,"[REVIEW_1] As a senior; I was looking for a bank for investments.  I wanted to diversify; and not have all my money with Edward Jones which is a great investment company.  When I entered the bank I was ignored.  The employees were chatting.  I had $500;000+ to invest.  I do not know why I was treated this way; but I chose to leave and go else where. [REVIEW_2] Weird location...looks like somebody's house..ancient equipment just like the workers. Probably an okay place to take your great grandma for a perm real quik; creepy old guy is the receptionist and barber. Super creepy. [REVIEW_3] I can write this review very easily because I was there to sample their beer and get a bite to eat but as soon as we walked in we were confused. There was no one at the host station and so we figured we could just walk to the bar? or seat ourselves? There was no one at the entrance at all. There were a few staff members walking around but no one took notice of us-it was busy but there was plenty of open seating left. After deciding to leave someone walked up to the host station as we opened the door. If I'm not worth being approached as a customer then it's not worth turning around and giving them a chance. [REVIEW_4] Worst place I've ever visited. The bouncer was rude and he didn't have to be. This place thinks just cause your on broadway you can treat people bad and over charge.   I'm not a tourist I live here and will never visit or recommend [REVIEW_5] First time turkey meal buyer. Absolutely disgusted. The turkey was raw when it was supposed to be fully cooked. Bloody n slimey and plain disgusting. Ruined Thanksgiving and can never get that day back.  Best advice:  DO NOT BUY!! [REVIEW_6] Absolutely the best Chinese buffet in the state of Indiana! Always fresh and friendly. Great selection of food and desserts. Location is tucked away in a corner of a strip mall. Could use a face lift but don't change it by the appearance. Best stuffed mushrooms! [REVIEW_7] Stopped in to Aldine on Friday night for a post-dinner drink and ended up getting a preview of some items that are now on the tasting menu. Atmosphere is minimalist romantic. Drinks were superb - interesting concoctions that actually were coherent (unlike other high end mixology-based bars in Philly). Smoked scallop was perfection; and the garnishes (fennel cracker? YES PLEASE) were creative and well executed. The carrot cake???  Delicious! Also got to try the butter sundae and chocolate mousse; both were excellent. Chef George (and his entire staff) was gracious; informative; and clearly is cooking at the top of his game. Just GO; order the tasting menu; and enjoy! I will be back soon and often. [REVIEW_8] $1.00 any draft beer until 10; are you kidding me!!! (Pretty damn good selection if I do say so) [REVIEW_9] Decent service; but food was subpar.  Stuff flounder tasted like mush.  Everything else was full of grease and lacking in flavor.  First and last time here..... [REVIEW_10] so we ordered brisket sandwiched from here waited forever for it to arrive and when the food came they had run our of brisket and given us roast beef instead. They never bothered to tell us that and some of the order was wrong completely. we called them and said they would remake the wrong items not the roast beef and they wanted the food back. the staff were very rude [REVIEW_11] I'm in the Clearwater area quite often for business so I'm always looking for good restaurants. Cafe Ponte was a recommendation from the customer who was joining us for dinner and it did not disappoint. The lobster bisque was excellent with just a hint of habanero. Something unique that I was not expecting. I had the Boullibaisse which was loaded with seafood in a rich broth. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town. [REVIEW_12] Absolutely terrible service!!! Do not waste a nice day/evening in this beautiful town at this place [REVIEW_13] Seriously one of the most pleasant dining experiences I have had in a while. Smiley himself is a true gem and the food was DELICIOUS. Had so much that I am eating it for lunch again today - and I can't wait! Please recommend to everyone you know in Manayunk; don't want to lose this place! [REVIEW_14] Stopped here for lunch on the way to drop some people off at the airport. It's a bit unexpected and a tiny bit off the beaten path on a residential street just behind a business district.  I chose the vegetarian plate and a Greek salad. The salad was the absolute best I've ever had. The cheese was absolutely fresh; the vegetables were fresh and chopped just for the salad; and the dressing and seasoning was perfect. The salad was quite large on its own and could easily make a light lunch by itself.  The vegetarian plate came along with their fresh pita-like bread that is baked fresh every morning; seasoned; pan fried vegetables; rice; and a tzatziki-like sauce drizzled on top. The flavors were astounding; and despite a lack of desire to stuff myself silly; I did anyway. Plenty of food for lunch and very reasonably priced. [REVIEW_15] We stopped on our way through Indianapolis.  My husband ordered the ribeye.  I ordered fried shrimp.  The waitress made our salads from the salad bar--my salad had three huge chunks of lettuce in it from the core of the lettuce.    His steak had good flavor and his baked potato was fine (since it's hard to screw up a baked potato)  My friend shrimp was overfried.  The rice pilaf was lumpy brown rice.  The applesauce was so sweet to be inedible.    I asked for rolls (which weren't brought with our meals) so I'd have a little more food to make up for that I didn't eat the rice pilaf or the applesauce and half my salad was the ""non-food"" part of the lettuce.  We go through that area frequently--but we won't stop there again.  I can't recommend it at all.",6
38,"[REVIEW_1] First off; where has fros√© been all my life?! Holy moly; I'm still dreaming of that delectable slushie masterpiece. We came here on a Tuesday night. The place was dead aside from one other table. I'm not sure why this was because the food was solid for a traditional tapas style restaurant. Nice selection; and good portion sizes. I split the vegetarian paella and it was more than enough for two people. It had a phenomenal flavor and didn't leave me feeling like a beached whale after so much rice; as other paellas have done in the past.  It's best to go with a big group and order a few dishes to share. Or be that one friend with trust issues. Either way; worth a visit! [REVIEW_2] So I have this problem in life.  For whatever reason; I like to grow my hair out as big and as untidy as possible.  My thick locks are wavy and what many would classify as ""unkempt"" when allowed to grow freely.  Not to say that my hair is dirty because I do wash it every day; but I just like the way my hair looks and feels when it is a booming mop.  There are other factors in life that when coupled with my lion's mane develop issues that need to be dealt with.  For one- I work at a financial institution; and as much as I would love to say that the world has developed into an open-minded; physical-appearances-don't-matter type of place (where everyone holds hands; endlessly sings lovable Cat Stevens songs; and skips along in unison); the reality is you all are a bunch of judgmental 'yotches who for some reason DO care about how my hair looks and think that it somehow makes me incapable of doing my job...  Well; maybe not *you*...  But definitely you there!  This ""feature"" of society (the part about judging a book by its cover) is multiplied 10-fold by the simple fact that I come from the Midwest.  OK- Chicago is cool and contemporary and all; but it still is the Midwest folks!  Or maybe I am the one that is delusional?  Maybe I just look rank with my wildin' out; big ass hair?  After all; it is my beautiful and fashionable wife who delicately reminds me a few times a year that my hair is; after all; something that needs care and styling; or at least a good hacking to.  Probably more care than the fine ladies at Hair Cuttery are capable (or more likely WILLING) of giving.  Which brings me to Dapper.  A friend of mine was raving about the job that these ladies do.  I pride myself in being quite open-minded; but was surprised to hear that it was a ""full-blown"" barber shop run by some tattooed punk rock ladies; ala roller derby style.  Where they offer complimentary beer and pool games while you wait for a chair to open up.  This alone wasn't enough to shock me; but the fact that it came from this particular friend.  What I mean to say is that if there was anyone in the world that I would guess did not give a crap about where he got his hair cut; it would be him.  He has had the same hair cut for over 15 years- military style.  So why go here; a hip place; clearly catered to those that are looking to pay a lot for a good haircut in a unique setting?  He then tells me because a cut is only going to cost $15.  To start the trip off; my hair was beyond the point where my wife was going to tolerate it much further.  I was at the ""wing"" stage; where the hair around my ear begins to uncontrollably flip up and look as if I did it on purpose with a hot curling iron or something (childhood evidence: http://static1.px.yelp.com/photo/YaQT9rb_q7LgQRD5Lhg8AQ/l ).    Winter in Chicago was coming!  I needed natural ear muffs!  As you can imagine- this ""excuse"" only goes so far.  So in I go; with wife in tow (I'm a poet and didn't even know it!).  We arrived only a short while before closing and I timidly asked if it was cool for me to still get a cut.  ""Of course!"" was the response; ""have a seat over there; help yourself to whatever is in the fridge and someone will be right with you!""  Hoping that they would turn me away for coming in too late; or without an appointment or whatever; I walked my shaggy self over to a couch and waited; stroking my long locks one last time before losing them (and about 5 pounds- my hair gets huge).  I was shortly called over by Jo; a fellow Illinoisan (is that what we are supposed to call ourselves?) by upbringing; who called me over and asked what I wanted.  ""I need a haircut; but don't really want one.""  After figuring out why I didn't want one (and agreeing with me; probably more out of kindness and empathy) she let me know I would be in good hands and that she would make things right.  Hair washed; and she goes into cutting.  Old-school style.  The way I remember getting it as a kid.  Nothing but scissors and straight razor.  No clippers (which I usually ask for a #3) with my cut.  And yet she got my noggin looking sharp; but still with some length and good shape.  Wings gone; or more like trimmed back; or tucked in or something.  I don't know how to describe the cut- but it looked really good!  Especially after the initial shock of losing my beloved; over-sized helmet; and realizing that I COULD in fact get my hair cut short and still have it look pretty good- and not have to spend a ton of money to do so!  And as for Jo- AWESOME.  She kept the conversation going and was into some really cool stuff!  I walked out with some weight off of my shoulders (figuratively and literally); and money left in my pocket.  Not to mention a very happy wife; who happened to start her night of drinking off the right way with a complimentary beer from that fridge.  Thanks Jo!  Wish you all were up here in Chicago...  I am sure for the same amount of dope service; I will be dropping $50. [REVIEW_3] Always great food and exceptional service!! I enjoy the food- well prepared and delicious. One of my favorite sushi restaurants. They have a generous appetizer menu and plenty of long rolls and hand rolls from which to choose. The sushi chefs and staff are always friendly and attentive. Food is always fresh and delightful. [REVIEW_4] Have you ever tried a new lunch place and liked it so much that you went back for dinner that night and lunch the next day. I have done the back to back to back only once; at Greko.   I've love the rotisserie chicken pita with fries. If you are in the mood for something healthier; they have great salads. Definitely try the Horta Greens (you can substitute fries for Horta Greens or have them on the side). The perfectly cooked and seasoned greens are delicious.  I also love the Athenian Chicken (half a rotisserie chicken).   As a quick; casual; food-first restaurant; Greko has hit the sweet spot. [REVIEW_5] It was easy to work with Preferred Party Rentals for a June graduation party. We browsed their inventory online and placed an online request for quote on the items we were interested in  (tent; tables; chairs; linens; etc.). Then we talked with them on the phone and tweaked the order (they suggested different size tablecloths; etc.). The delivery crew coordinated well with us and quickly set up the tent. Everything was easy; we will absolutely use them again for our next party. [REVIEW_6] Great local bar! I love the portobello sandwich. It's marinated in balsamic too. So yummy! The Hoppy Ass beer is a great IPA at an unbelievable price. Great place to meet with friends for food and drinks. It is also kid friendly. The also have a chess game if you want to play with your friend while enjoying a cold beer! [REVIEW_7] If I could give it a zero; I would. I order a plain hamburger; and realized they put  bacon in it (which I am allergic to and unable to eat) after two bites. When I went back to the drive-through window to complain (didn't realize the actual restaurant was open--it was almost 2 after all...); the guy took back the burger; said nothing; and disappeared. After 2 minutes of awkwardly making conversation with the next people in line in their car; he came back and rudely told me I had to go inside to get my food. Which I did. And still did not get an apology.  I refuse to go back there after that ordeal; which is a shame; because it's nice to have a variety of places to go to after DT. Guess Freebirds it is! [REVIEW_8] This place is fantastic! I went here for Valentine's Day with my boyfriend and his family. It was such a fun; cozy atmosphere; the waiters were great; and the food was AMAZING! My favorite dish was the phyllo dough pastry; filled with chicken and topped with powdered sugar (I'm sure there were more ingredients in the making of this dish; but I just don't know what they are). It sounds really weird; but it was super delicious!  We ended up being seated at a table with another couple because the place is actually pretty small; but that wasn't weird. The entire atmosphere was very friendly and all the tables were very close to each other. We were lucky that it happened to be a Friday night because there was a belly dancer there! She encouraged us to get up and dance with her; which was really fun and made us all laugh. Like all the reviews say; be prepared to stuff yourself! They give you more food than anyone can handle! But it's all amazing; so you can't say no. The restaurant is also BYOB; which is a great plus! The only down side is that it's cash-only; and the bill can get quite high if you have a large group (It was a bit under $50 per person). [REVIEW_9] I just called to place a delivery order and they stated they could not do it. I have to come into the store if I wanted to get food from them. WHAT!!!! [REVIEW_10] Great location; close to all the ""tourist-y"" stuff.  Hotel is beautiful!  You can walk to everything including the Arch and Busch Stadium.  Close to dining.  Felt safe there and the staff was excellent!! [REVIEW_11] I've been coming here since I was a kid. Always great. Stopped by for lunch and was totally ignored. While I was not in her station Sue took it upon herself to assist me and got my drink order. The waitress I was supposed to have finally came over and asked me what I wanted. I told her I was already being helped and Sue finished the service. I was just about to leave when Sue approached me. Thank you Sue. Now I still have great feelings about this wonderful Florida institution that is Ted Peters. [REVIEW_12] Took the youth group out for a fun night..definitely won't return.    Everything was gross.   Tables were unclean.   Told that food would be done in 30 minutes.   Definitely took almost an hour.   Balls were nasty.  Seriously.  Everything about this place is disgusting.  The chairs are all tore up.   The mini golf needs to be updated.  I went up to ask about about bumpers (we were playing crazy bowl) they refused.  Said that we were too old.  I have 11-13 year olds.  The two lanes next to us had bumpers up and plenty of adults in their 30-40's but because they had 1-2 kids the were allowed to have the bumpers up.   Seriously.  We will never be back.  None of the kids want to come here any more.  Swing around fun town it is.  The icing on the cake was the ""help"" at the front desk.  All 5 guys were just sitting around.  One guy checked us out but had to be a real jerk.  My husband went up to buy 7 mini golfs..one of the workers said ""you gonna pay for that?""  Seriously? [REVIEW_13] We went here for a birthday party and had a blast.  Keep in mind this isn't a typical piano bar. There is minimal seating intentionally as it has more of a bar/club feel than a lounge. The place is pretty relaxed until about 10-11pm. Then they clear out tables for a dance floor. It has a very energetic vibe.  If you want seating you need to get there early; 6 or 7; and camp out. Treat your server well if you are going to kerping seats all night. Choose a table on the side or back so it doesn't get taken away later in the evening. On a Saturday there was no cover when we arrived at 8pm; making it convenient for friends who weren't with the birthday group.  Now for the birthday group reservation. The package offered free entry plus a drink per person and a few other perks. It ended up being very convenient for our group as it carved out an area where we can all comfortably hang out with seats as well as mingle with friends who showed up spontaneously. The personal service with the group reservation was fantastic. They take good care of the birthday group and make sure everyone always has a fresh drink in hand. [REVIEW_14] First time buyer and immediately impressed with the level of professionalism and customer service from David. I bought 3 bottles of wine to be shipped to a friend and provided the wrong address. After the shipment was delivered; David went out of his way to make things right and shipped to the correct address for me. I am now a Redneck Wine fan! :) [REVIEW_15] Food was good. I had the weekly champion burger; The Vermont Breakfast. Great! The fries; catsup; and other sauces were good too. Beer selection was good; but JESSICA was the best. Sit at the bar and have faith she'll give you a great experience! Best service I've ever had in my life.",12
39,"[REVIEW_1] Op suggestie van yelp- hier geweest op onze eerste avond in NOLA tijdens onze roadtrip (dag3). It's the best place. Wachttijden kunnen oplopen; maar waar Nederland vaak faliekant in faalt; gaat hier geweldig: er wordt door t personeel vlijmscherp in de gaten gehouden wie er aan de beurt is; zelfs voor de krukken aan de bar. Bijna gingen er mensen die later waren gearriveerd dan wij er met onze lang verwachte krukken vandoor; maar de barman regelde dit op sublieme wijze. Het moraal van dit verhaal- je raakt hier niet ge√Ørriteerd omdat andere mensen voor schnitzelen. Ondertussen word je getrakteerd op de lekkerste live muziek en hebben ze er heerlijke cocktails en prima wijnen. Eten was ondergeschikt deze avond; maar wat we hadden was bijzonder goed. Dikke aanrader- wellicht reserveren als je niet van eindeloos wachten houdt. [REVIEW_2] Pretty good food; if you like food poisoning.  Had beef wraps last night. Pretty tasty. A little fatty. Have had diarrhea all day; and others who ate the food with had to skip class because they couldn't leave the bathroom.  When I came in to tell the manager; the staff working the cash register seemed uninterested and said they would relay the message to the manager; and then returned to using their cell phone.   A quick search on the Environmental Health Services website shows reports in the last 3 years include the following MAJOR VIOLATIONS:   11/29/2016 Rodents; insects; birds or animals Hot and cold holding temperatures Hands clean and properly washed; proper glove use Food contact surfaces: clean and sanitized  02/10/2015  Hot and cold holding temperatures Food contact surfaces: clean and sanitized  03/05/2014  Adequate handwashing facilities available and accessible Food contact surfaces: clean and sanitized Hot and cold holding temperatures   I urge anyone to reconsider if they decide to eat at this restaurant. [REVIEW_3] I phoned this restaurant on December 28th and booked a reservation (I thought) for December 29th.  When we arrived at the restaurant; a completely unapologetic; in fact; rude; person informed us that they don't take reservations; and they could not possibly accommodate our party of 5; because they were short-staffed.  He hoped we would come another time; but if we didn't; oh well....  Apparently the ""reservation"" had been taken by an old man who used to own the restaurant; but doesn't anymore.  The disdain we felt from this person; whether head waiter; server; owner (!) will not quickly be forgotten; and we left; vowing never to come back.    I had $200 worth of gift certificates; which I sold at a loss; rather than be reminded of the Parkallen Restaurant.   Incidently; the restaurant had at least 3 tables which could have been arranged to accommodate our party.  They just wanted nothing to do with us.  I understand this restaurant has new ownership - I wish for their failure. It cannot possibly matter whether the food is good or not; when the service is this atrocious. [REVIEW_4] Only giving a 1 because there is nothing lower!!! Angie Gave me the worst haircut I've ever had!!! I came in with 2 photos of the cut I wanted came out with my hair looking NOTHING like the photos!!  Even when pointed out to her she didn't not pay attention to what she was doing.  Came out basically having a mans flattop!  Would never go to this place again!!! Nothing like going into the Holidays with a crappie haircut. Thank you!! Angie and Regis Hair salon!! [REVIEW_5] Awful business model it took forever to even figure out where to order. on top of that the workers actually are not professional at all. on top of THAT my other half sandwhich didn't even have sausage covering even half of the bread. easily worst place i've been in a while [REVIEW_6] STAY AWAY from this place unless you want to possibly be hit by a ""drunk gambler ""coming from there.  It's no wander this Joe Bob's is never busy.  The only thing that the owners and bartenders care about are the gamblers that get over-served and gamble there daily.   I'm definitely gonna stay away from that part of town after 4ish as that's when the ""heavy hitters"" come in to support the greasy; dirty; place that really only cares about their gamblers.  The kitchen has some kinda mold issues that literally smells like a sewer plant.  The 2 gals that have made a career outta this dump rely on the drunkards to tip them ""big"" if they win on the slots.  This is a very sad version of any kinda chicken joint or sports bar.  The greed that the owners share is obvious as flat screens are cheap these days and these guys can't even loosen their hands on the ""gambling profit"" to invest in to this dump.   Is sad as the original owners did a great job and these new guys don't care about anything except the profit from the slot machines; including the nasty food they serve.  The bartenders are high-strung and anything but friendly; unless of course; you are gambling big and they have a chance at a big tip.   Your better off going to the fast food chicken joint across the stree t""El Pollo Loco"" and guessing the kitchen is cleaner and the staff is friendlier and you won't be subjected to the daily drunks that drive to and from this place daily.  VERY SCARY!!! [REVIEW_7] This place is UNTOUCHABLE if you want a great environment to enjoy the best sushi in PA. They are clean; very quick with service and just impeccable. I have been all over the area and this is the one I continue to come back to. The outdoor seating is wonderful and there is an area that is under a roof so you can enjoy the outdoors even if the weather is a bit dreary. And the one thing that amazes me is no matter how full the parking lot seems they WITHOUT FAIL are extremely speedy no matter how many customers they have. I wish I could give more than 5 stars.  TOP NOTCH! [REVIEW_8] This place has the best sushi/sashimi I've ever had.  I've been here a few times while visiting family; and it is always one of the highlights of the trips.  Simon makes tasty; flavorful rolls that are artistically presented.  The Green Dragon Roll is my favorites - it's so cute AND tasty!  I don't know what he does to his avocados; but they are creamy and delicious.  His rolls are well balanced; never too much rice; and from what I can tell; the fish is high quality.  He also makes very creative appetizers; a different one each time I've been there. One of my favorites is the Tuna Shumai - like butter!  It's a play on traditional shumai with tuna instead of a dumpling wrapper.  In short; this place is awesome. [REVIEW_9] first off the service is absolutely terrible. the waiter only came over to take our order and bring us our drinks and food. after that when we needed something we practically had to look around to hunt him down during our entire meal. he never bothered to come over to check on us to see if we needed drink refills or how our food was. even when we wanted our check he was no where to be found.  as for the food; my sister had ordered the clam chowder and she had to send it back and asked them to reheat it because it wasn't even warm; it was room tempature. than between the 5 of us we had ordered other dishes and 20 wings (4/person) well there was definitely 20 piece of chicken on the plate; if you count the one tiny piece that looks like the very tip of the chicken wing that usually gets thrown out.  when we brought it up to the waiters attention; after having to look for him for 15 mins; his response was the chefs usually cooks a big batch at a time so they probably miscounted so he'll bring us another wing. we waited another 15 minutes before finally getting his attention to ask for our check and a couple boxes. so by now we have leftovers all packed up and money in the check sleeve ready for the waiter to take. i wanted to leave a feedback with the manager on duty there about our meal so I asked a waitress to get the manager for me since our waiter wasn't around. now we are pretty much ready to leave and the one piece of wing never came out; that is until our waiter overheard us asking for the manager. because as soon as the manager got to our table so did the one piece of chicken wing soaked in oil.  when we told the manager about the wings he pretty much brushed it off and laughed in our face and said ""I guarantee the chefs didn't count this as a wing"" and that ""they probably just shorted you guys a wing and so someone else here got that extra wing"". it was 20 wings for $20 so his solution was telling us he'll take a dollar off our bill if we wanted.  i felt like that was a slap to my face and I felt a little discriminated; like if I wasn't asian things would've been different. I wasn't looking for any type of discount or freebie; all i wanted to do was give a feedback to the manager so he knows they should be more careful since this wasn't the first time they ""miscounted"" (in the past I've been shorted on wings and shrimps) tonight is the last time I'm ever eating/drinking here and i will no longer be recommending people to come here. [REVIEW_10] Bummer; just moved to this area and this was my first visit to this location.  I didn't receive my change or receipt;  it was just change but I asked for it and she said she gave it to me; um no. Was in a hurry so I didn't wanna argue.  And no spoon for my chili. Cheese on my burger was old; which means my burger wasn't freshly made. Tasted ok but won't return. [REVIEW_11] Went in with a friend for a bite to eat before doing some bar hopping. For some reason the menu to me seemed somewhat limited but I might be alone on that. It's not pricey but for the type of food they serve I feel like it's slightly over priced and in my opinion that food wasn't out of this world. It was average at best. We tipped our waitress 15% and she was slightly rude to us on the way out. Overall not a fan...there's much better places out there to spend your money. [REVIEW_12] Great Greek food with friendly service from Alan.  I had a lamb gyro from a place down south this week that confirmed that Santorini offers the best gyro around and definitely my favorite. [REVIEW_13] Sadly I am revoking my 5 star review of Gallagher's. I went here last night and asked for their world famous nachos. Guess what; new menu. SERIOUSLY you're going to get rid of the awesome nachos?  No more frosted beer mugs plastic cups. And they also changed the prices on pitchers. PBR now $12 instead of $9. This will not stand.  I would also like to mention the place smelled like a ""radio rock festival"" or cat urine. It looks like Gallagher's is changing for their new lame clientele and they just lost a great customer. [REVIEW_14] I tired to be calm and not get upset . But I had a recurring charge going to my credit card and I was told it would be self payment . Because I asked about auto pay because the location was in Laplace and I was not sure if I would come back . So when I check my credit card statement there was of course a auto payment for 3 months and just this month of May their were two in one month so I was upset that I did not know because I had not been going and had join a different gym .  So to avoid me getting upset about losing money and the double charge I had on my May statement. I felt I would just call and cancel the subscriptions! Ow was I in for it . They make you send an email to them !!! And then you have to wait for a response ! I signed up at the location with ease why is cancellation not as easy ! Omg then told me I have to give 30days notice so I would basically still have to pay for June and then pow ! A cancellation fee !! Or you serious !! So all together to unjoin a whopping $57 dollars only from me visiting once !  I was so upset because I have already lost so much money and don't like the place . so I call my credit card and charge it as Fraud !! And had to be sent a card replacement because I'm not having it ! It was a lesson learned and you just would not think a gym business would take advantage of you like that . Because even when my card changed at planet fitness they did not charge back pay ; only charged for that month . Smh plz save yourself the headache! [REVIEW_15] Pathetic experience with them. I ordered for rava masala dosa and vegetable uttapam to take out. They gave me dosa which is as good as burnt. Packing was so bad that the dosa layer has stuck to the white sheet of wrap. It did not smell good either. I called them and explained the story. I was expecting an apology and someone to provide us with the replacement if not refund but nothing of the sort. They did not even apologize; forget about refund or replacement. i shall be disposing the dosa as is. Uttapam was not very good either. It tasted sour and cilantro seemed old. I could not take it more than few loaves. Remaining will go in the dustbin as well.  Such a disgusting experience with them",4
40,"[REVIEW_1] After trying twice unsuccessfully to get there early enough to get a meal within 20 minutes; I finally was able to break away from work and was 5th in line. I had heard of the ""food truck nazi"" and that it was the best in town and found Gus; the falafel nazi; as he called himself; lived up to his reputation and more.  As my turn came up; I approached the cart tenuously; for I did not want to blow it by asking too many questions. He immediately recognized me as a new customer and told me all about the fresh ingredients he uses. Chicken is cooked over coal and was tender on the inside and perfectly cooked on the outside. Falafel was delicious; as were the grapes and his homemade pasta that went along with it. There was enough food for 2 people. Well worth the wait! [REVIEW_2] Went there because it was featured on one of those TV food shows.  Wow.  This place is excellent.  At prime time the lines are long; outside; and wrap around the corner.  Expect to wait-Expect the wait to be worth it!  The food is delicious.  The service moves with the precision of a well-trained military unit (that's a good thing!)  Prices are fair; portions are generous.  The variety and unique items make the meal one of those things you'll talk about afterwards; you'll share your positive experience with friends and family; and you'll go back. [REVIEW_3] I went to this store because they carried the phone that my daughter wanted.  I had researched the price and knew what i needed. The sales Associate; seemed professional; until he told me the price of my bill!  the numbers did not add up. I was shocked to say the least.  He was trying to sell me a shield for my phone; for 40.00- I did not ask for this.  I only wanted the phone and a case. I told him about my employer discount at least 5 times.  He gave me a ""new"" price; which seemed to be more in the ballpark of what I was looking to spend.  I asked for my receipt; and was not provided a detailed break down of what my charges were- first time ever! I was so angry that I had to leave the store. I called Verizon when I got home; they were able to direct me to my detailed receipt on line.  Turns out he charged me for insurance that I was not offered nor did I want and he did not give me my accessory discount! I am still so angry over how this sales associate tried to screw me and my daughter.  Buyer beware!!! ask for a detailed receipt.  do some homework before you go if you choose to use this store.  needless to say I will never go back there! [REVIEW_4] All you can eat lobsters.. $54.00. A steal of a deal... I had 10... $5.40 a lobster.;... . cooked to perfection!!! [REVIEW_5] I absolutely love Sprinkles cupcakes. In my opinion; the cupcakes are perfectly moist and every cupcake I have had so far has been extremely satisfying. My personal favorite is German Chocolate cake. This location is fairly small so it looks like there is a bigger line than there actually is.  Oh; check out there rewards program it pretty awesome it got me a free cupcake when I signed up! [REVIEW_6] Horrible customer service.  Customers should be allowed to try on another size.  The sales associate actually refused to get me another size; which is not what I have experienced at other stores.  I wasn't asking for anything out of the ordinary; I only took in 2 bras and wanted ONE of them in a different size.  The store wasn't busy so I don't understand her reluctance. You can give me advice on how it should fit; but don't make me stand there peeking out of the fitting room doorway; half dressed; trying to justify why I just want to *try* the next size up.  I know how I want my lingerie to fit and will go elsewhere where I won't be put in such a humiliating situation. [REVIEW_7] I'm not going to be returning to Santa Fe for a while. I just didn't like it; flat out. I've been before for chips and salsa and margaritas; and that was just ok; but I went recently for a full meal and I just cannot get past the fact that the tuna on my yellowtail tostada was cooked hopefully that morning or maybe even the day before; but it was not fresh. It had a congealed coat on the outside of it and it was cold; so I know it came from the fridge. The salad it sat on; iceberg; was so ordinary; it completely downgraded the dish. Haven't they discovered the beauty of baby mixed greens; they are pretty and make every salad seem a lot classier. The best part of the meal were the chips and salsa. Kind of sad really. In my opinion; fresh is always better and when it comes to fish; fresh should be the only option!!! [REVIEW_8] Wait staff was pleasant but food took forever even though it wasn't remotely busy. Burger bun too soggy .....fries have a funky dust on them. Everything was super salty or greasy.   What is all the hype about?   Not cheap either.  Terrible.  Stay away.  Seriously.   BTW.  Two hours later and my husband and I are both feeling queasy. Thank goodness for Alka Seltzer [REVIEW_9] This is my favorite place for Mexican! Meals always come out piping hot and delicious. We love the seafood burrito but haven't had a bad meal. The chips and salsa are mediocre but the meal makes up for them. The margarita and beer selection is also plenty and they keep pouring as requested! [REVIEW_10] Cool little place that has amazing cookie dough! It tastes just like real cookie dough; but is made without eggs or dairy (chocolate chips technically are handled with dairy). They'll let you try whatever you want so have at it until you find what you like. 1 scoop is more than enough. You can get it in a cone or a cup just like ice cream! It stays if you need to take it home for later or the next day! Love it! Staff is super welcoming and will tell you all about the flavors and process if you have questions! [REVIEW_11] This is my husband's favorite brunch place. It's hard to get him to go anywhere else! Their yogurt parfait is the absolute best in the city. Their specials are always creative; and on point. Food is consistently delicious. The thing I love most about Ants Pants is the portioning of the food. Some brunch places give you nonsensical portions; and I always feel bad; because I feel like I'm wasting food. Ants Pants gives you very reasonable portions. We always have the same server; and he is super sweet and attentive; even when he's the only one there! [REVIEW_12] A year since first review and this place keeps drawing us back We bring all our friends and they come on their own too. Considering that we all live in Pennsylvania; it says something about quality; atmosphere and pricing. Yes it's noisy on Friday and Saturday; but not painfully so. Service is pleasant; efficient and accommodating. Food remains great. Chicken cacciatore; a dish I normally would not order; is fabulous here. Portions are large. Almost everyone leaves with a doggy bag and no one leaves hungry. [REVIEW_13] Wallet was stolen today at this starbucks.  The workers there were not helpful at all.  They wanted me to ""file a report"" to corporate and would call if it showed up.  Meanwhile someone was having fun with my credit card in cherry hill; new jersey.  And they made it seem like it was my fault that it was stolen; but it was stolen when i was sitting with my items. Not helpful or sympathetic. [REVIEW_14] This is my all time favorite boutique in Nashville.  I always find the one of a kind shoes and deals!   Ask for John Bowyer if you visit the store; he is very patient and helpful. [REVIEW_15] Great experience. I reserved online one hour prior to checking the bike out. The bike was in good shape and exceeded my expectation. Will return in the future.",10
41,"[REVIEW_1] I didn't like this place at all. Those devil eggs things were disgusting and this seems more of a bar than a restaurant. Good bloody Mary's but that was it [REVIEW_2] Went to have lunch and place had nice ambiance and service was very good and friendly. Then came the food. They had several options. I had the pick three of sausage; brisket and ribs. The two sides were beans and greens. Out of the three meats the sausage was the least worse. All were dry and the sides did not have favors I would expect. I did not like anything. You even had to pay for bread.  I tried covering them up with the bbq sauces however even those were strange tasting. The sweet was pure molasses. The house was the only one I could tolerate.  I think they need to hire a cook that has tastebuds. We tried the apple crumble pie for desert and we even threw that away as it had no sweetness at all and no texture.  The price was crazy. Never again. Go to one of the many BBQ places in St. Louis that actually has good food. [REVIEW_3] Worst dinner ever. Place was empty and the not so friendly greeter asked us 3 times how many people were in our party. Then we waited 15 min for our sever; another 15 for her to bring us water. Dinner took 30 min to arrive ; again place was empty.  The food was terrible. [REVIEW_4] This is my very first review.  I figured reviewing Village Whiskey would kick me off to a good start.    My wife and I arrived at 8:00pm and was told there was a 2 hour wait.  I read reviews prior to arriving so I was prepared to wait.  I was still a little surprised at how small this place is.  We decided to wait around by the bar.  After waiting for roughly 25 minutes; a spot opened up at a sit down counter; adjacent to the bar.    For starters; we ordered the pickled red and golden beets along with turnips and black kale from their pickled section.  We liked the pickled beets but the turnips and black kale surprisingly where our favorite.  The acidity was mild and the black kale was crisp.  The toppings I ordered on my burger were Rogue Smokey Bleu; caramelized onions; bacon; and a fried egg.  I had high expectations for my burger and I was not disappointed.  It was cooked to perfection.  I wish I knew what grinds of meet they used to create their burgers because they had the right amount of fat to keep them moist and where full of flavor.  I was underwhelmed with the duck fat French fries.  They were okay; but nothing exceptional to me. The S'more milk shake was excellent!  The homemade marshmallow had all the characteristics and nuances of their camp fire cousins.    I woke up the next day; thinking about the burger I consumed the night before at the Village Whiskey.  Hands down; this is ONE of the best burgers I have eaten! [REVIEW_5] Horrible. Waited over 2 hours for our order. Called the store 3 times- kept being told it was on its way. Pizza was under done and terrible. the manager said he would refund my order. Never gave a refund. I will be going in person tomorrow for a refund. [REVIEW_6] As someone from out of town; all I could look forward to was the food. And let me tell you it was a disappointment. I read many good reviews about this establishment. If I could give them no stars I would. Could not run out of there fast enough. Their half peeled shrimp was literal mush. They had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. The shrimp peel was brown; they were probably cooked about a month ago; put in a freezer and served them to me as they thawed. Their jambalaya was further than the truth. It was pasta in tomato sauce with a minuscule piece of chicken. And the fact that I had to pay as I left was bewildering. Not even their mediocre waiters could save; what I would call; the worst dining experience of my life. The only thing that made it worthwhile was when the hostess removed the atrocity that was my dinner and asked ""they nasty?"" [REVIEW_7] I went to the salon for a hair cut and Meghan was my stylist. She did an ABSOLUTELY amazing job and was full of personality. I got a wash; cut; and blow out all for $27 bucks because it was my first time! I also got a coupon to come back for 20% off anything I have done in the salon which I will be redeeming later this month. I am very excited to find a great salon that is near my house & doesn't cost a million dollars to get something done.   I have been here for the Benefit Brow Bar as well which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND; if you want your brows to look amazing - it is the best place you can go . I trust them with my life.   I really can't say anything negative about Ulta. I am surprised at the ""rude customer service"" complaint because I have only experienced the best here. (plus there is always a coupon so I really REALLY love this place).  OK bye! [REVIEW_8] First off. let me say I have not eaten at this restaurant.  I went in to simply pick up a menu so that I could order from home and go pick up my meal.    Upon walking into the restaurant; I stood by the counter/register and waited for someone to come to the front.  A woman walked up from the back of the place and said; ""ya"".  I asked for a to-go menu; received one and left.  I perused the menu in the car and noticed they seen to be priced higher than many other Indian places in the Nashville area.    Sorry; but ""ya"" is not how I prefer to be greeted.  Like I said; I have not eaten at this restaurant.  After this brief encounter; I will not do so.  Also; I find it very interesting that the most recent positive reviews of this restaurant are from folks with Indian names who live in other states. [REVIEW_9] i was staying at the lovely Hotel Monaco (to which this bar is connected to) and figured that I would give this place a try.  The vibe is just a little uptight.  A bit like a sports bar.  I attempted to venture upstairs when I was accosted by a very tall; very bald doorman who looked like he was going to burst a blood vessel as he brusquely steered me away from that area; explaining that it was only for diners.  Ok Max Headroom!  Get your prescription changed. [REVIEW_10] This place deserves 5 STARS.  It was such a great place to eat at a French style bakery; drink one of the best cups of coffee I've ever had and relax. I would highly recommend this little spot. Great choice. We'll be back! [REVIEW_11] All I can say is Haley makes me look and feel like a Rock Star!!! She is awesome and knows just what I want and delivers. When I say make it blue with green and purple she triangles me up and I come out  looking fabulous. [REVIEW_12] When I received my to-go order; I asked for a couple cups of water and tomato sauce.  The cashier said he needed to first take care of customers waiting to order; and he would call our number later.  Even after we finished our food 40 minutes later; we never heard him calling again.  I think we deserve better when we ordered $35 worth of food. [REVIEW_13] We called Sierra Air on February 24th Saturday for them to check our thermostat to furnace was not working.  Sierra Air came within the hour and cleaned the furnace sensors and all was well.  We bought our home a couple years ago and this was the first time we had the furnace serviced; now we know to have it serviced annually; especially for all the Safety Sensors.  The Serviceman was very polite and answered all our questions.  Thank You Sierra Air! [REVIEW_14] Literally the most racist restaurant I have ever been into in my life. The manager was as unprofessional as the teenagers running the register. I literally waited for 5 minutes to be called to a register for my order with no one else on any lines. Not sure if it was my skin tone but wow I had another experience that made my suspicions facts after paying a second order and being passed over by 3 other customers who ordered after me. I only ordered a kids nuggets. Terrible everything [REVIEW_15] Aw; man. I was hoping I'd previously posted a glowing review of RuSan's so I could prove that once upon a time; I liked it here. But; I didn't so just trust me on this one.  It is with a heavy heart that I relay today's experience over the lunch sushi buffet. Cold; gelatinous; and ~$11/each. It's been a year or three but I remember this being so much better. Don't get me wrong... I love cheap; fast food-ish; ethnic cuisine and I have lovely memories of the Ginger Simmered Beef; Fried Garlic and Bay Shrimp Salad Maki (like I said; once upon a time); but today? Lackluster is an overstatement.  With each bite; I kept hoping the next would be better. But; alas. It wasn't.   Why; RuSan's? With all your new neighboring restauranteurs in The Gulch; is this the taste of complacency? I shake my head in disappointment because I know your potential and cherish what we once had.   On the upside; my water was refreshing and the service was fine.",5
42,"[REVIEW_1] 1st time here; my three friends and I ordered 4 bowls of ranmen and 4 cans of melon cream soda . I will say my curry katsu ramen was the best I've ever had and i just had Nom Noms ramen the day before. The staff was awesome and attentive.  I even booked my bday party here for next month. 100%/100%  In addition; the Kustu was crispy and the broth for my curry ramen was light and not over powerd by salts. The eggs were perfect again I just had nom noms the day before ; and my 3 eggs from nom noms were cold.  So out of  our table group of four; 3 guest gives Naoki 10/10  and 1 guest gives it 6/10.   My background is in Asian culinary arts and hospitality. [REVIEW_2] 0 Stars for customer service would be appropriate. The disaster they created for my daughter's confirmation cannot be put in words. Everybody is entitled to make mistakes even big ones it's how they handle them.  Allow me to describe the situation. It all started when we receive the Box minutes before our luncheon with somebody else's name on it. The cake didn't fit in the box so we walked across town with an open box.  When we open the Box it had our daughter's name on it however it looked like it was written by a first grader. None of the requested decorations including the Holy Cross and others were not included which was the purpose of the cake. The top it off the cake was  completely dry would have been better off with a cake from acme. The cake was loaded with these plastic sticks and I'm unsure why we counted over 40 of them; making it impossible to cut. We attempted to call master Baker several times and they were not open finally 2 weeks after the event were able to get ahold to somebody who could actually care less......"" said thank you for the learning experience we will discuss it are a next meeting."" That's it No desire to disgusted details and all they did was criticize us for waiting so long to get back to them when in fact they were never open when we called. We had photograph evidence of what they provided us still unwilling to listen.  Well Chad I can't believe you would treat customers like we were treated. [REVIEW_3] Worst concert experience I've had. Buyers; beware. They're only interested in your money NOT your experience. My husband spent A LOT of money on an Imagine Dragons VIP package and it left much to be desired. The ""gift bag"" was filled with a small; cheap crumpled poster; plastic sunglasses; a pop socket; and a phone charger fit for a circa 2015 android. The ""crowd free shopping"" consisted of about 200 people crammed in a small area with general admission goers; and the ""hassle free entry"" took 45 minute. So; all in all I sit here really pissed about the experience; feeling bad for my husband who wanted to surprise; and the concert hasn't even started yet. Bravo CID. Thank you for seriously putting a damper on my night. [REVIEW_4] Would give zero stars if possible. Let me start with the caveat that the band is fantastic; I would give them five stars. They are great performers and play very well (though I will grant that I do not know much about jazz). My complaint is lodged firmly with the people that run Preservation Hall. I didn't care about waiting in line; or the (looking back rather steep) cover charge. It was a little annoying that the room was set up more for a poetry slam than a jazz hall but whatever. No; my real complaint lies in how they have a ridiculous (imo) cell phone rule that they insisted on enforcing like the gluten-free ban at a Montessori school bake sale. When we got there there were multiple signs that warned against taking photos or video. This was really disappointing as I had really hoped to at least take a photo. But okay; as disappointing as it was; I hung in there (mostly because one of the people in my party really loves jazz and we had already paid the cover charge). The show gets ready to start and this lady comes out and gives this oddly pretentious speech (this is downtown NOLA; not Whole Foods) and reminds us like six times not to dare take a photo. This is only an annoyance at this point; like we get it; there are literally at least four signs in this room of forty people. Finally the lights go out in the room; musicians come out and I'm ready to chill. Now; one thing you should know is that Preservation Hall is that it is essentially a box of a room with large open doorways that lead out into a narrow hall that leads outside. The second thing you should know is that they leave the lights on in the hallway the whole time (they sell things out there). This means that anyone who moves around in the hallway is distracting; simply based off the light that attracts your eyes. Anyways; the music starts and for a few seconds it looks like this place just might redeem itself; like I said the jazz is great. Then; about two minutes in; the lady who lectured us before comes scuttling into the doorway where she starts peering into the gloom at the patrons. After a few seconds; she scurries back down the hall out of sight (again; this is really distracting because of the lights). At first I figured she was looking for someone or something but as she proceeds to repeat this performance every couple minutes I begin to realize she's policing the silent audience for the flash of a cell phone. Not only is this insane; (I didn't see a single person so much as twitch toward their phones) but if you have to police something with this level of intensity then maybe start a jazz club in a maximum security prison. After about twenty-thirty minutes the whole experience was so unpleasant that we all just left. 0/10 would never recommend. [REVIEW_5] I called Remember Me for some basic information.  The woman that answered the phone told me her name; after I asked; was Diane.  I asked if she was the manager.  She rambled on about not being able to run something and that she would call me back.  I told her that I didn't need her to call me back; but instead just the manager's name.  She said the same thing about calling me back.  So I asked if she was the manager and she hung up on me.  I wouldn't spend a dime here.  If this is the way they treat potential customers that are simply calling I can't imagine how they treat people in the store. [REVIEW_6] Not exactly sure why this service calls itself Reno-Tahoe Shuttle when it does not service Reno...just tried to book a ride from the RENO-TAHOE AIRPORT and apparently this is out of their pick up area. Very confused.  And if you can't help me; maybe you can direct me to someone who CAN. [REVIEW_7] I was very disappointed with the cake I ordered. I picked it up at the shop. The service was very slow and I paid for the cake before I picked it up. I sat there for 10-15 minutes just for someone to wrap a bow around the already boxed cake. I ordered the White and Black Cake. The icing was not sweet at all and it was greasy. The cake was heavy and did not have much of a flavor. The cake was certainly not worth $70. [REVIEW_8] Staff was very nice and helpful but we were extremely disappointed with the food. We ordered Eggplant Parmesan in which tasted like it came out of the frozen section from the grocery store and the spaghetti sauce tasted bitter as if they poured it out of the jar. We were totally disappoint in the food. [REVIEW_9] Octopus; pizza; bar service. I love the laid back vibe; unpretentious food; and great flavor combinations. [REVIEW_10] Came in at 9:59 am when they open at 10 am; door was unlocked and everything but they lady was very rude and told us they weren't open. Walked out a couple steps turned around and she had flicked the open sign on. Decided not to walk back because of the poor customer service. [REVIEW_11] I believe the Customer Service experience is in serious decline. I have been an Emerald Club member for about four years and the Customer Satisfaction trend is definitely going in the wrong direction; DOWN. I arrived in St. Louis last week; specifically Wednesday mid-afternoon. There were no vehicles immediately available. I had to wait over ten minutes and was forced to take the first vehicle made available to me. Then; when returning on Friday; I was initially over charged 100%. I had to go inside to the office for my bill to be properly adjusted. This took over 30 minutes to complete. Lastly; no employee said sorry for the inconvenience or thank you for your business. I doubt I will ever utilize National or give them my business again sorry to say. [REVIEW_12] Just left there...horrible service and miserable employees.  WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN. Miss Baja fresh. [REVIEW_13] We had two items on the menu.  Lettuce wraps and Almond Chicken.  We came with a coupon and found it could only be used on some items.  The Almond Chicken was eh ok but the rice served with it was cold.  The lettuce wraps filling was also cold.  The lettuce were pieces torn and thrown on a plate resembling no shells served with care.  The filling was bland even with salt and pepper and soy sauce.  In short they were awful.  For 9 dollars I was expecting more.  The food; service and price were not worth the one star given; I would not bother; its not worth it! [REVIEW_14] My mother-in-law has been there for over an year; and their is one issue after another. My wife has had to go and complain because they miss giving her Parkinson Medication; on multiple occasion. Just this week my  mother-in-law did not let my wife to take her out to Christmas shop because Manor Care has not given her a bath in over a week. She also told us that one of the aid; lifted her out of her wheel chair by pull up on her neck. We have talked to the director several time who committed to resolve the issues and does for a while; then something else develops. The state has been involved; but problems still arise. We are now looking into relocating her near our home in Idaho. Do not put any love one in manor care; unless you are able to check on them weekly. [REVIEW_15] Loud loud loud!  And the food sucks. They got new management not too long along; doubt they made an improvements.",2
43,[REVIEW_1] Ok; this is not a 5 star; but I'm  giving the 5th star due to value for money.  The sectional that seats 4-5 with ottoman makes it comfortable if you want to visit with another couple.  Rooms were nice and spacious except for the tiny bathroom.  We would stay again and recommend to friends. Staff was friendly and helpful.  They had some tasty breakfast sandwich combinations. Tasty; made frequently; so relatively fresh.  Much better than most complementary breakfast options.  Edit:  I left something in room and they are FedEx to me (my cost).  I very much appreciate their quick response. [REVIEW_2] The drinks and the customer care are the only redeeming factor to this place. Not an authentic Mexican food- order chicken enchiladas without cheese or sourcream and the chicken was crunchy...like old rubber crunchy! Sent it back got beef tacos much better but the beans were super dry. The group said the beef was good. Probs wouldn't come back. [REVIEW_3] Excellent place for a quick and casual breakfast. Delicious French toast. There are a lot of options on the menu. We also enjoyed the generous potion of fruit. Highly recommend if you have kids. [REVIEW_4] Franklin; TN is adorable! And within this ADORABLE little city; on this ADORABLE street; is an ADORABLE restaurant called Red Pony.  I made reservations for the bf's birthday and because we were on a road trip. Upon arrival we were greeted by a very sweet hostess. Our waitress was friendly; knowledgeable and prompt.   Fried green tomatoes; trout; a salad; and an amazing slice of coconut cake later; we were on cloud 9.   This place is a gem! [REVIEW_5] Ooooooh I love Costcooooooo (That's the song I just wrote for them.)  Catchy eh?  This place is the best.  High quality items; samples at every turn; great prices on bulk items that you need and some things you didn't know you needed until you got there!  The employees are always friendly and the check out is FAST.  Even if there are lines; you won't wait long.  You can tell that the employees are treated right and paid well because everyone seems to care about their job.  You are a winner Costco! [REVIEW_6] The pho is abysmal. There is no flavor to it; it literally tastes like boiled water. The noodles were clumped together when the bowl got to me; which means they didn't make the noddles fresh; but they've been sitting around for some time. The meat used in the pho is was chewy. [REVIEW_7] Eclipse Pizza defines what a tasty pie + gourmet toppings is.  The bicycle friendly house-like restaurant is nestled in a neighborhood like commercial area on the corner of McCarran and Mayberry Dr. Besides just pizzas they also have gourmet salads and of course; calzones.  On my first time there; we got calzones to go:   Mine = Hawaiian w/ pineapple; mushrooms(normally ham); macadamia nuts; pesto sauce & mozzi  My Pals' = The Grecian w/ Kalamata Olives; roasted peppers; roasted garlic; tomato sauce & feta cheese  On the second time; I took 2 little ones aged 6 & 10 where we went simple and got half cheese and half artichoke and chicken.  I think this was where I really noticed the savory-delicious taste of Eclipse Pizza's Red sauce and their salads.   The atmosphere is very relaxed and although I tend to prefer take-away; I will look forward to the few times I will be dining in with friends and a wine or a beer. [REVIEW_8] Before buying any furniture for our new home in Tucson; we shopped around. We actually shopped around too much; visiting 20+ furniture stores in the area.  Hands DOWN discount mattress barn was the cheapest.   Steve personally set up my bar stools on one visit; and made 100% sure it was assembled level. And on another loaded my extra large ottoman into my van all by himself.  By purchasing from Discount Mattress Barn; you get so much more than just the best value. You get amazing customer service!! [REVIEW_9] I came after a friend got me a livingsocial deal. It was difficult to schedule an appointment. The facial was the worst one I've ever had. No extractions. The lady didn't even speak to me. My face just felt oily after. The pedicure was worst. She filed my nails for 40 minutes. They looked jagged and the paint job was messy. There was no place to wait for my feet to dry and I had to ask of it was ok to wait at the bowl. No massage; not even any lotion. And this was the spa pedicure; not the express. If hate to see what the express is. [REVIEW_10] I really wanted to like this place because of the cool ambiance.  I ordered the Philly cheese steak.  Aside from the mediocre taste; small portion size; and unreasonably high price of my entree;  the fact that it gave me food poisoning really nailed it home.  On the plus side; nobody else at my table endured food poisoning from their entrees (omelets and juevos rancheros) and the wait staff was pleasant. [REVIEW_11] Terrific home cooked feel. Quick service but quality and taste isn't sacrificed. Best local Mexican food in malvern area IMO. [REVIEW_12] I love the waxing method from EWC! Less pain; no irritation (I have sensitive skin) and they don't double dip the part that they spread the wax with. I usually go with Despina or Jenny. [REVIEW_13] Awful - long wait times; slow service; out of ingredients; and orders filled sloppily and incorrectly. Go down the street to the one on York Road near the mall. [REVIEW_14] I gave it one star because it doesn't give me an option to give it zero. This place sucks. Where should I start?? Okay; arrived at 7 pm with reservations and was seated in the dungeon. Fine. We ordered queso fundido with chorizo and got a weird looking cheese skillet with tortillas NOT chips. Odd! So had to ask for chips. Should've asked for a trash can. So we asked for some salsa to dress it up a bit -- that took an hour and I'm not exaggerating! The salsa was a thick mushy mess. Could turn the bowl upside down and nothng would've come out. Our food took an hour and a half; too. By that time; we were full on chips -- which were the only good thing on the menu! Oh... My favorite part... I ordered a side of beans and rice to go with my carne asada tacos -- which were more like unseasoned beef tips -- and I got a bowl of hard WHITE rice with refried beans on top. WHITE rice??? Seriously?!  Terrible! Dont waste your time. Taco Bell serves better food than this and that isn't saying much! Service was just as bad!! [REVIEW_15] At long last! I don't have to drive to the southside of Tucson for authentic Mexican food. Great service; decent menu &  definitely worth a visit.,9
44,"[REVIEW_1] My sister discovered this restaurant and our family is so happy to have some authentic Salvadoran food. Food is great but the service is sometimes slow; so don't be in a rush when you go. Pupusas and the Bistec Salvadoreano -- yum! [REVIEW_2] I must have been unconscious because I stood in some kind of a line for several hours for nothing... not only was it terrible but it was also the most unorganized mess I have ever seen in my life. Save your money and time buy beer instead [REVIEW_3] Our first time is our last time.  Worst margaritas we've had anywhere.  What Mexican restaurant can't make a good margarita??  Each of our meals was boring and unauthentic.  My burrito came wrapped in a piece of foil served on a plate (felt like I had hit a drive thru).   No sides...just one chicken burrito for $9.99.   When we tried to use our $3 off $15 coupon we were told we couldn't use it.  Really?  After spending almost $50 on three regular margaritas and two entrees (no appetizers and no desserts and yes it cost that much).   Extremely overpriced; poor service; boring food. [REVIEW_4] I'm a big fan of the food here but recently noticed that they don't do a great job of washing their beer glasses here. When you see the bubbles sticking to the inside of the glass that's when you know something's up. Other than that; I'd probably give the place four stars. [REVIEW_5] This place has the worst customer service. My friend and I went to jack in the box at 12:30AM on a Wednesday night. We were the only ones there and I went to order my food and said okay so that's it for that order; we're gonna have a second order and he said we actually can't do two orders and I understand that during a rush or something but we were the only ones there. So I said that and said well we are literally the only people in the drive thru; like what difference does it make? And he was like you can come in the store and do two orders and I was wasn't going to do that so I told him I would drive around again even though it was completely unnecessary. So I got my food and went around again (still no cars had been through the drive thru) and ordered a single coke. Not even food which made it more annoying. But anyways. So we got to the window and wanted to get more fries because they gave me a super small amount in my meal but we weren't gonna complain because we were already over this experience. So we were just gonna buy them. And so we asked if we could add on fries and she said no!! She literally said ""uhmmmmmm no"". And I was speechless. Needless to say. Screw them. [REVIEW_6] Sadly I am revoking my 5 star review of Gallagher's. I went here last night and asked for their world famous nachos. Guess what; new menu. SERIOUSLY you're going to get rid of the awesome nachos?  No more frosted beer mugs plastic cups. And they also changed the prices on pitchers. PBR now $12 instead of $9. This will not stand.  I would also like to mention the place smelled like a ""radio rock festival"" or cat urine. It looks like Gallagher's is changing for their new lame clientele and they just lost a great customer. [REVIEW_7] This was possibly the worst experience I've ever had at any restaurant.   General disappointments: They were out of orange juice; diet coke; and to go boxes. Someone waited twenty minutes to order food to go and then overheard the staff tell someone else they were out of to go boxes and couldn't accommodate any take out orders. (I think all customers would have appreciated knowing upfront that these items and services were unavailable.)  Service disappointments: While our initial interaction with our waitress was seemingly standard and friendly; I can't provide any additional positive feedback about her because we barely saw her again.The waiter who brought us our beverages informed us of their lack of diet coke and forgot 2/3 waters. We spent over 35 minutes trying to make eye contact with our waitress to get her attention - and although we made eye contact; she never came over.  We spent 45 minutes waiting for refills on water and coffee (and of course our food); while other customers who had been seated after us and were simply sitting closer to the kitchen enjoyed their food. At this point I stood up and walked over towards the kitchen to request refills; and a different waitress said she would be right with us. Ten minutes later our waitress came over with refills and said our food shouldn't be much longer.   This is now 55 minutes into our breakfast. (Just to be clear we all ordered eggs and the restaurant was not full.) While she was at our table we requested a set of utensils (since only 2/3 of our party was given a set of utensils when we were seated). In addition we requested salt and ketchup - because at this point we had high hopes our food would be arriving soon and our table was not prepared with these items unlike the other tables near us.  Finally over an hour after being seated our food arrived with unmelted cheese on the eggs and 2 packets of ketchup for our table of 3. When the waitress walked away we took the bottle of ketchup from an empty table nearby and ate our breakfast.   This was a disappointing visit to say the least. I recommend you do not visit this establishment under any circumstances. [REVIEW_8] Service sucks big time and the manager is downright nasty; but I must say their soups and coffee are good [REVIEW_9] Horrible; I wish we read the reviews before going in; what a downer this place was!  Let us sit for an hour and then brought out cold food.  My two grand sons were with and they were pinging off the wall by the time the cold food got to our table.   I have literally been to iHops all over and hands down this was the worst experience we have ever had.  Generally I think of iHop as a safe bet while traveling; but this may have ruined that rep for good. [REVIEW_10] If you order a salad; be carful for the ingredients.. I found bacon; Spanish in my Fuji Apple salad.. And they did not add the blue cheese... They mess up the general taste of the plate.. [REVIEW_11] I have eaten here several times during the four years I have lived in Philly; and have had happy hours or cocktail events here as well; as an employee of a company in the building; and I have had wonderful experiences. This is thanks completely to the *servers; bartenders; and kitchen staff*. On Valentine's Day; however; we had a very different experience. I am confident that the servers and kitchen staff were amazing as always; but we never found out. We made our reservation about a month and a half early; to ensure a window seat. OpenTable asked for a credit card when booking--no problem; we provided it. Upon arrival; we were told that; since we did not place a deposit; there was not a table for us. Yes; they could see our reservation in the system; they said; they can see the date on which we placed the reservation; a month and a half prior. However; they claim to have called us (one time) to get a deposit from us; and since they were unsuccessful; they didn't hold us a table (again; they can see our reservation; they knew we were coming).  **No one had ever called to obtain a deposit from us.**  Further; had they needed a deposit; that should have been worked out between OpenTable and R2L--not our problem. OpenTable asked for a credit card and we provided one. Plus; how incredibly rude is it to require a deposit for a table reservation anyway? As a semi-regular at this place I find that greatly offensive. We weren't speaking with hourly-waged youngsters either; we started with a manager and were escalated to ""one of the owners"". Neither woman made an attempt to be friendly; let alone apologetic or accommodating in any way.  This lady who was ""one of the owners"" should definitely keep herself exclusively in the back of the house; away from any sort of paying customer.  I have never; as a customer; been treated so poorly or talked to so terribly. And; no; I can assure you; we were not out of line or yelling or making a scene or rude for our part; we just aren't the type. She was plain awful.  Never so much as a shred of an inkling of a hint of an apology or any effort whatsoever.  So; despite all of the rave verbal reviews I have given everyone I know about this place in the past; I will now make sure that everyone we know; meet; work with; or do business with--several of whom work in that building--does not ever drink or dine at R2L.  And; clearly; we will never step foot into the place again either. After leaving; we had an amazing meal with mind-blowing service at DEVON SEAFOOD. Go there instead! [REVIEW_12] Unless you have gray hair ; are over 45 and appear wealthy ; don't expect to get good service . My girlfriend and I sat there and witnessed our waitress cut up with many older couples in suits ; then would check on us every half hour to 40 minutes ; and didn't even check on our steaks and how they were prepared. The management never asked how our meal was ;(we witnessed them going table to table). VERY disappointed for spending $80; to get this poor of service . [REVIEW_13] We went for lunch on Saturday.  They only serve from a brunch menu.  It was very disappointing.  They really need to re-think the brunch menu and serve items from their good at.  I never had dinner her although I would assume it is better than the brunch items.  I had the meatball omelette which was just ok.  I would say anywhere else would have better omelets. My husband had the burger with an egg on it.  He thought it was good but there are better burgers out there.  I should have went with my gut instinct after seeing the brunch menu but decided to stay since it was Joe Madden's restaurant.  I say skip this place and go down the street to Goody Goody. [REVIEW_14] I went in for a manicure and I will not be coming back. I walked in and immediately wanted to leave. It was so uncomfortably hot and stuffy. As I was choosing the color the girl came up to me and asked if I was ready. Less than a minute later she comes up to me again and asks if I'm ready. So rude.  When I did sit down for the manicure; she did not take good care of me. She barely used the nippers on my cuticles or skin and filed my nails crooked. Then she left half way through my manicure to do three eyebrow waxings. As if this weren't bad enough; she got polish on my fingers and missed a sizable amount on my pinkies. I will not be returning to this establishment and I hope you will not either. Go to LyLy's across the highway. Better customer service and quality manicure! [REVIEW_15] Looking for something tasteless; greasy; and overpriced?! Head on over to George's Sandwich Shop! What a disaster. The roast pork sandwich is listed as $7.00; fine; but any sandwich-eater worth their salt (or pepper) knows that a sandwich isn't complete without some toppings; and George's sticks it to you ever-so-casually: ""Anything on that?"" Unsuspecting customers will be charged on top of the $7 for what should be basic; included toppings. This would be acceptable if the sandwich had any semblance of decency; yet it is completely revolting from first glance to last choked bite.The bread was completely soggy and drenched in oil that was hot enough to burn my hand. The pork was entirely flavorless; the provolone and broccoli rabe couldn't even save it. I regret wasting my appetite on this disgrace of a sandwich. Do yourself a favor and go down the street to Paesano's instead.",1
45,"[REVIEW_1] Customers beware! If there was a way to give this business zero stars- that is how I would rate it. There is a huge banner on this location that says it is under new management because of the horrible reputation that it has. To say that they ripped me off would be an understatement. I took my Ford diesel truck in because it was close by when my engine started smoking. Biggest mistake of my life. They kept my truck for over a month- sold me used parts and charged me as if they were new parts. Charged my bank card unauthorized charges and to top it off; after paying over $7;800.00 my truck still wasn't working. I finally took it to the Ford dealer where they documented everything that was wrong with my truck and even confirmed that the wrong type of USED turbo was put on my truck. The manager Ray at the time was also just on channel 13 news because he was arrested for doing this to other customers. Seems like Midas transferred him to another location after too many complaints. I will be contacting a lawyer and the District Attorneys office.   I should also mention that during this process Ray hired me to do Landscaping upgrades to the business and I never received payment. This is not a place that you can trust. [REVIEW_2] The Optical center at the Springfield location is a total ripoff and a con IMO. as soon as the clerk found out I had $450 on insurance to spend he went to work with his little calculator for 20 min while I sat there; giving me no options or telling me what the hell he was doing. Then when the bill was wY beyond that he was cryptic about the charges then finally admitted he used items from FIVE years ago to come up with a price for my glasses! Then had the nerve to try and sell me sunglasses for $250. A total hustle and when I confronted him he didn't even en defend himself. Go somewhere else. I am as I felt totally ripped off on behalf of my insurance company. [REVIEW_3] Really clean super cute cafe. Very friendly & the Caprese sandwich is amazing. So glad I found this gem :) [REVIEW_4] Good coffee; super cute location; and some of the best service anywhere. I haven't eaten there yet; but I'm sure I will be back to try the food in the next few days. The barista Kayla (I don't know if the spelling is correct) was super friendly; and she took a bunch of time to recommend other places in the area. [REVIEW_5] Have only ordered pizza but it was above and beyond every other pizza I've ordered in south Philly. Can't wait to try other menu items! [REVIEW_6] McDonalds... What do you need to know?..   They serve the purpose. I'd complain about the inaudible Spanish fellow working the drive through but why would I expect much else..  Update:  they just charged me .25 cents for ranch..  I'm pretty wealthy actually but this stuff is so annoying.  I handed him a dollar; took 4 of them and walked to the trash can to throw away 3 of them as I only needed one.  I feel I made my point.. [REVIEW_7] No stars. Like many people I purchased through Priceline. Got to counter and the girl said you want four wheel drive right? I had prepaid $26 a day. She said it's $27 a day for that. So I'm thinking $1 a day upgrade ? Ya. That's fine. I get a Hyundai. Then I see another withdrawal from my bank account more than doubling my charges for the rental. When I returned the car and bring up the issue the guys said it was a daily upgrade. So I argue with the manager and he says I can't do anything there is a signed contract. I said what's your name? He said dan. What's your last name? You don't need it and slammed the window in my face! Great customer service. I will never use Avis again and I will make sure no one I know does either. [REVIEW_8] I just finished my very rushed;very awful experience at Ed's Rec Room. They have recently decided to charge bowling by time; and not by game. This has taken away all of the fun and relaxation from the game; and added an element of annoyance and panic. Also; your time begins to countdown the second you pay for it; leaving you rushing to put on your shoes and put your groups names into the system. And heaven forbid you need to take a bathroom break; or need a beverage! You don't get to PAUSE your time for ANYTHING. They didn't even have a server; so if you're hoping to have a couple beers; better get ready to run quick and get them yourself. The lane even malfunctioned a couple times; but there's no time to wait for a service worker to fix it; because they don't bother extending the time you've lost. I would have rather paid a few extra bucks a game than been forced to play a speedy game to get my monies worth. Extremely unimpressed; and will not be returning until they fix their rates. [REVIEW_9] I'm new to the area and was looking for a bikini wax for a weekend at the beach. Did my research (mostly yelp!) and scheduled an appointment. The building was impossible to find (in an office building with NO signs whatsoever or indication of the spa); and when I arrived the front desk staff was on the phone; busy; and had no time for me. She checked my name in and told me to sit down; then walked away before I could ask where the waiting area was.   The wax was the worst wax I've ever had - and I've been waxing for years. Erica didn't double-dip the sticks; but used the paper strips over and over; which I found unsettling. The conversation was fine; she was pleasant enough but did a terrible job. This next part is a bit ahem; graphic; so first-time waxers beware...   Compared to other aestheticians that take their time and position your legs in various positions to get the best possible view and angle for waxing; she simply had me open one leg at a time and waxed the entire area like that. This was much more painful; as each area was not pulled taut when she waxed; and resulted in an unsightly (not to mention painful) bruise in my nether regions. The rest of the area was red for hours longer than it usually is.  Then; when I went to pay; the girls behind the desk were *again* on the phone/talking/too busy to talk to me. After a while; I finally got someone's attention; but while I was her asking a question; the phone rang. Without so much as asking me to hold on; she answered it; began talking; and walked away. I signed my credit card receipt and stood there awkwardly; alone; wondering if I was finished. Finally; when they noticed me; I asked if I was done. The woman said yes and just waved me away.   I escorted myself out; feeling dismissed and completely unimportant. Although the spa is very nice and high-end; I got the impression they cater preferentially to more wealthy clientele; and regular people like me were just dismissed without a thought. [REVIEW_10] This is the worst bar experience I've ever had. I'll try to be brief. The three beers I tried to order last night were Sierra Nevada; Sweetwater 420; and Sam Adams Boston Lager. I drink these beers regularly draft and bottle and I am very familiar with them.   I ordered a Sierra Nevada and it came out flat and warm. My friend ordered a Yazoo Pale Ale and received a cloudy; orange colored; spicy smelling blue moon.   We sent them back and ordered Sweetwater 420 instead. They where also flat and warm.  The manager said their must be a problem with the draft system and offered us bottled beer instead. I ordered my standard choice of Sam Adams figuring it was a safe bet.  He returned  with a brown bottle with NO LABEL and quickly put it on the table without saying anything or apologizing and walked away. When I took a sip it was one of the same flat warm beers that came out of the draft; I couldn't quite identify it; but it wasn't Sam Adams. I realized that they had filled an empty bottle with Sam Adams. When I realized this bottle probably came out of the recycling I stood up an left. I'm still deciding if I'm going to call the Nashville Health Department on Monday.    I understand mistakes happen; and so I was polite and patient with them. In return; I've never been more disrespected by any restaurant or bar. Any other place would have thanked me for pointing out the issue and taken care of it. [REVIEW_11] Was not impressed at all. We were going to eat st IHOP but since the wait time was way too long for three kids we walked over to 5 guys. First off the prices are nuts ...a burger was like 6.99 and comes with no fries so I thought well maybe it's a big burger. Nope a regular Mcdonalds size burger. The fries were loaded down with salt...it felt like I was eating a pound of salt. Then I ordered the veggie sandwich. I'm thinking I'm getting a veggie burger nope it's just onions peppers mushroom on a bun. Super disgusting! It was almost $50 for us to eat at a fast food joint and the food was gross!  I could have went to Mcdonalds and had dessert lunch and breakfast for that price and had a better meal. My husband used to work at a 5 guys in SC and as I remember the fries came with the burger as a meal fresh in a bag and the burgers were huge! We had to take half of it home.  I would not recommend this place at all especially if your on a budget. [REVIEW_12] Do not do it unless you just want to drink. We had the hummus platter. It was ok at best. Then for the nachos. Gross. Sent them back and ordered the BTL. Took one bite and asked for our check to get the heck out. We are both just crossing our fingers we don't end up sick. [REVIEW_13] Terrible service. Waited in line for an hour and finally the hostess told us they were ""suspending seating because the kitchen is backed up""; on  Saturday evening! Don't waste your time there... [REVIEW_14] The food was great nice character! We sta on the porch durining lunch time with a beer I really enjoyed watching the cars go by something I dont get a chance to do.....Loved IT! [REVIEW_15] Great spot for Sunday brunch. We were sat immediately; which is always a positive. The servers were extremely polite and kind. Our drinks were delicious and the food was great.  I personally ordered the Petite Filet with the truffle scrambled eggs; was the perfect portion. My fianc√© ordered their famous BBQ shrimp; very tasty but were a tad over cooked; was very difficult to remove the shells. When we mentioned it to our server she was very nice and even offered a complimentary dessert. Also ordered at the table were the Eggs Benedict and the Fried Oyster Sliders; they were also enjoyed very much. A tad expensive for breakfast but it was all very good.  To finish our meal we ordered the Bread Pudding....amazing; also the White Chocolate Brownie was very good!! Overall a great experience.   Keep in mind they also have live music for Sunday brunch!",5
46,"[REVIEW_1] I just went here for the first time today; and I LOVE it. I got a regular manicure for $12 (not including the $10 I tipped her); but I would have happily paid twice that. The manicurist worked quickly and professionally and was very attentive to detail. The little hand massage was great and she made sure that I was happy with how my nails were looking as she went. The whole process took about 45 minutes and my nails are flawless. All three ladies that were working were very sweet and accommodating. The salon itself is very clean with new-looking furniture and equipment; and the decor and lighting is quite calming. I'm definitely going back next week for a pedicure! [REVIEW_2] We decide to make it a ""once a year trip at least"" from the Orlando area. This place will scare for the amount of people that will pass through. Don't let it. It's well organized. Just decided what you want pick a number and they will serve you within 5 mins top. We bought 5/6 cheeses  a couple of dry meats and a bottle of Cannonau wine. Enjoyed it in the patio and left after closing the brunch with an amaretto ball and a sfogliatella. Buy sfogliatelle before they are gone. They run out in less than 1/2 hours. So worth it! [REVIEW_3] Quick and super friendly. Emily was super helpful with our order. The burgers were cooked just right and our order of fries and onion rings were just the right amount of crisp. Overall; this was a great experience. [REVIEW_4] Looking for a great restaurant in the Boothwyn; PA area?  We highly recommend you give this place a try.  Remember to bring along a bottle of wine to enjoy with your meal. [REVIEW_5] The service is fast and super friendly. I love the lunch special it's definitely satisfying; im a big fan. [REVIEW_6] A great lunch or dinner stop in Reno; NV.    We've had some fine meals in this establishment......Tyler (manager) does a great job with his staff; and it shows in the overall results.  They are also a pub; so its got a great selection of beers and wines too! [REVIEW_7] It was a Saturday night and market st in Philly was swarming with people. My friends and I checked 2 restaurants but they both had over an hour long waits. The wait at Anjou? Non existant. That should have been a red flag right there but we were starving and they had couscous on the menu; April's fave.  The menu wasn't cheap but the food sounded good. Marco and Karina ordered the ""Chilean Sea Bass w/ Tarot puree; heart of palm salad; atop a miso glaze [26]"". April ordered the ""Pan Seared Red Chile Norwegian Salmon; Sweet peas & couscous in a sun dried tomato; red pepper sauce [22]"" because again; she was seriously craving couscous. A fourth companion; Megan; ordered the ""Bi Bim Bap- A medley of vegetable & egg julienne; served with two traditional Korean sauces and a bowl of miso soup (available without beef) [16]."" I opted for the ""French Cut Chicken Breast; Wasabi gnocchi; wild mushrooms; & asparagus in a sweet garlic ginger sauce [22].""  All sounds delicious doesn't it? Yeah; we thought so too.  First problem. A chip in my glass that was sharp enough to cut a lip. I didn't get cut but I could have! Did I mention the plastic shard at Cheesecake?? The waitress apologized and gave me a fresh glass. Fine; no biggie.   Second problem. They ran out of gnocchi for my chicken and tried to push the mashed potatoes. Hey; I can make that at home for a dollar. No thanks. So they said they can do risotto. Fine; no biggie.  Third problem. A very; VERY long wait. For a restaurant that wasn't very busy; they sure like to take their time. Maybe they were trying to lure other unsuspecting people from the outside by pretending that they have a full happening place like the rest of them but my friends and I had no interest in being part of their marketing gimmick. We just wanted to be fed! The food had better be worth the wait....  Fourth problem. We finally received our entrees and I immediately recognized a problem. April; the poor innocent patron who had ordered the salmon because of the couscous received; before her; a plate looking very barren with a piece of salmon the size and shape of a sleeve of laffy taffys; 6 or 7 halves of asparagus; and NO COUSCOUS. BIG BIGGIE.  ""Where's her couscous?!"" I blurted out. That's when we noticed that nearly all our dishes were missing crucial elements from the menu.   The chilean sea bass was NOT served with mashed taro and hearts of palm salad. just a ring of MASHED POTATOES. Maybe I should have asked what ""french cut"" meant because now I know that it means ""slice a chicken breast as thin and flat as possible to try to cover the plate and keep down costs."" My wild mushrooms must've gone loco because they were nowhere on my plate. Maybe they were partying it up with my asparagus because they were also m.i.a. My risotto? Oh it was there all right; resting on my plate like a pale; sticky dome of something that resembled MASHED POTATOES! Since when is it okay to be able to scoop risotto with an ice cream scooper??   We were not happy campers. We went on a hunger strike. The host went back to the kitchen to find out what happened. He came back and informed us that ""they ran out of the couscous; and the mashed taro"" AND the gnocchi??? And the wild mushrooms??? What do you have back there; a 50 lb bag of instant MASHED POTATOES???   The rest is blur. I remember telling the host/waiter/customer service you can't just change an order without asking the patron if it's fine with them. He agreed and took care of the drinks that we had ordered. That much they did right. We still left a tip for the waitress because we felt horrible that she has to tell family and friends that she works there.   We left. Still hungry and livid. The waitress was outside crying and smoking a cigarette. Poor girl; I hope she moves on to a decent establishment like Hooters or Fudruckkers. I wish her well.  The 5 of us went down the street to Soho Pizza and scarfed scrumptious slices for 2.50 a piece. And when I ordered the mushroom and broccoli pizza; both mushrooms AND broccoli appeared on my slice. See; other people can do it; why can't Anjou?   Unless you want mashed potatoes; don't go here.   EDIT 1/19/10-  It has come to my attention that this dreadful place is now CLOSED. VICTORY!!!! [REVIEW_8] This place was unreal. The chips and queso were so warm and delicious. The burrito I got with fried shrimp and cauliflower in it sounds weird but it was incredible. The food was so flavorful and such a good mix of tastes. The churros were to die for. The staff were all super friendly and nice. If you are looking for some amazing Mexican food go here!! [REVIEW_9] We came here based on the recommendation we received and from the street it doesn't look like much. But when you sit down and you scan the menu you will come to realize that this place serves nothing but home-cooked comfort food. We had the BLT and it was packed full of flavor; they didn't scrimp on the bacon and the vegetables for very fresh. With the sandwiches came some of the best french fries that we've had; and some of the best coleslaw that I've had in the state of Florida. We took a couple of pies home and they were delicious. We will definitely come back. [REVIEW_10] The food at this location was amazing. I throughly enjoyed the food and service provided by Ciara (I couldn't find my receipt; so I'm not sure if the spelling is correct). However; Ciara was pleasant; responsive; quick; and knowledgeable about the menu and the surrounding areas. I would definitely visit this location again!  P.S. the jalape√±o cornbread was delicious. [REVIEW_11] We had such a great meal at Spiro's tonight! Neither my dining companion; nor myself had been there previously. We both had a Greek salad; which was prepared table side. I had the Dolmades; and my coworker; the combo plate which had moussaka and dolmas and lamb (which he could not stop raving about). To our surprise our server brought dessert on the house; since we had never dined there before; it was such a nice touch! Ben our server was fantastic and knowledgable. We are both in the industry so we felt guilty about staying until the restaurant closed; but we were just so comfortable and well fed that we lost track of time. Spiro's is very close to my house; it will definitely be my new regular spot. Thank you Ben; and the whole Spiro's crew; for a great time to compliment a rare night off! You rock! [REVIEW_12] Full disclosure- I was a frequent visitor of the Khyber in it's previous life; as a dark & dirty; divey rock venue. I was such a loyal visitor; I refused to go to this ""Khyber Pass Pub"" for a long time out of loyalty to the spirit of the original Khyber. How dare they take it away from me! Well; I confess: I was goddamn stupid. STUPID; I say.  After hearing through word-of-mouth (you know; how people found out about things pre-Yelp); that the KPP had a bangin' menu (their words); we decided to drop in on a Friday. It was a First Friday in old city; so I prepared for a madhouse.  Not so much. It was busy; but we were seated within 10 minutes. The tables are a weeee bit too close together though. Another 6 inches in each direction would be great; but as long as your sister's miscarriage isn't a topic of conversation; everything should be gravy. I mean bacon fat. I mean bacon fat popcorn. What? I'm sorry; I wasn't paying attention. It says ""bacon fat popcorn"" on the menu. (You should try it. It's well worth the vein clog.)  The menu: Do you love BBQ with a southern/Louisiana flavor? This is the place. Pulled pork? Yes; gimme more. They have a BBQ sampler for those who can't choose. The vegan po' boy is great too; and I'm not even vegan. Their mashed potatoes are basically ""we cooked this potato in enchanted salt water and literally smashed it onto your plate."" And surprise! That's vegan too. The mac & cheese is not; of course. I burned my mouth on it from eating it too fast; and you know what? Worth it.  Huge draft list; and reasonably priced.  If you have a mixed group of vegans; veggies; omnivores; carnivores; and beer fanatics; this is the Place To Take Them All. Go during the week to avoid the old city weekend crowds. I've been there several times now and it makes me feel silly for not going for so long. But it's ok; I plan on making up for lost time. [REVIEW_13] Never Ender boutique is a hidden charming place located on Thoma; just west of Center street. It's a cute 1930's house that has been transformed into a boutique and art gallery. The items they carry are one-of-a-kind. Not your typical conforming wares. They carry items that are mostly handmade; and all are made in USA. They focus on carrying items made by artists. The owner; Melanie Crane loves the artists; and carefully selects which items to carry! You will NOT find your usual and typical jewelry; clothing or art. It is all unique with its own identity. Do yourself a favor - do NOT miss visiting this store! I can guarantee you it will not be your last visit. Trust me! [REVIEW_14] Tried this place out this morning due to the relatively cheap price and good reviews and I was VERY disappointed. I swear my spicy tuna roll was warm and nobody wants room temperature raw fish! The mussels were dried out and tiny and 90% of the rolls on the menu have cream cheese so there's not much variety. I had two rolls and just left rather than continue eating there and will not be returning when there are so many other good sushi options in Reno.  I will saw however that the staff was very friendly; and I don't think it was the staffs fault as much as it as the obviously low quality ingredients. [REVIEW_15] Posted hours indicate a 9pm closing on Monday nights. Last night at 8:53; the door was locked. Not a big deal; but as I glanced at the hours a surly clerk near the door said in a rather mean tone; ""It doesn't matter anyway. GOODBYE!""  Really? That's how you do business? Be shitty and antagonistic to customers because you close early?   I've spent my final dime in Am. Spirits; there are other options.",12
47,"[REVIEW_1] I don't know what some of these peoples problems are with this place (other than veiled racism) but taking a wedding dress in to be fitted 7 months out is idiotic; regardless of how secure you are in your sizing.  Anyway; I've never had a problem here whatsoever. They aren't all warm and fuzzy; but I'm paying for competence; not smiles; and competent they assuredly are. They got out decade old blood stains out of a ball hockey jersey and have an average turnaround of 2-3 days; even during the holidays and wedding season.   I can't recommend them enough. When we move; we will most certainly still be taking our clothes in here for dry cleaning and alterations. [REVIEW_2] Tried this place out as soon as it opened. We took one bite of the burger and threw out the food. it was as if we couldn't drink enough to wash the excessive amount of grease away. It was like everything was thrown in grease that wasn't heated at a high enough temperature and then the top of the burger bun was also given a layer of grease. We haven't been back since. [REVIEW_3] Absolutely terrible customer service. I am for sure ranting here... Asked for a happy hour menu on one of my visits. The lady bartender said it was happy hour and she would get me a menu. Ordered fried pickles and a beer from the menu. Went to pay my bill an hour later and the dude with the long beard behind the bar rung me up. My bill was for normal price (and overpriced). He said the order was put it at 3:59 it looked like. He was a total jerk about it with no forgiveness after I told him I was led to believe it was happy hour. Needless to say there was no tip!  I went back; a few days later; shockingly. Ordered a cocktail. A simple old fashioned with brandy. I asked for soco and they didn't have it. So i asked for brandy. Cocktail was good. Get the bill later ... $12 cocktail. For real! It wasn't even an 8oz cocktail. More like a 4oz! And there was a $4 bogus charge on there which i was unaware about when ordering and that long bearded guy again behind the bar told me what it was for after the fact (something to do with adding a higher liquor quantity). I wouldn't have wanted that in the first place!! So again; no forgiveness and forced to pay that bill. Again; zero tip.   otherwise; you can get takeout beer here and the outdoor couches are ok. But customer service really blows!!! they're so slow and unforgiving and confusing ! I hope that long bearded guy is not a manager. Very pathetic [REVIEW_4] I love Roma burgers; I try to have one in every city I visit but this location butchered the Roma burger. Over cooked the usually mouth melting burger so it was tough. Over toasted the bun so it was tough. A shame. Next time I will try a different location. [REVIEW_5] I was Sitting down  sipping a coffee and  waiting on a sandwich for 25 minutes or more.    so when I went to cancel the order being I had an appointment to make I was told "" but it's ready"" I look at the toast on the toaster tray and not a sandwich ready and say ""just the coffee please I really need to go.""   The owner says ""ok; one fifty for coffee next time if your in a rush say something""      so I hand her a ten dollar bill and she gives me eight dollars back then turns away and leaves  I guess I paid the extra fifty cents for the toast that was not used.......  NEVER AGAIN!!! [REVIEW_6] We love Philly and go every New Years Eve. We have experienced many hotels in the area ... this by far was our worst. The location is ok; not great. Their are some restaurants ( El Rey; continental) within walking distance. (walking distance to us is 5-10 blocks). The parking is $36 a day. The valet was polite and did there jobs. Front desk was nice and did there jobs as well. No issues with the staff. The lobby is misleading.The room size is average but the bathrooms are small and nonfunctional. The bed sucks no polite way to say it; first night I was up every hour due to the discomfort. REQUEST extra pillows! Was not super clean either in the bathroom. The rooms are not sound proff!!!! We could hear a couple fighting on top of us. To the point where we had to go to the lobby because we thought he was killing her. We could hear full conversations. Now this also explains the people who frequant the hotel.  This point is even more illistrate by the fact when we brought the fight to the attention of the staff they were not phased. I know it was New Years but listening to a girl getting choked out was not a good time actually it was a buzz kill. So we will never stay here again. [REVIEW_7] I love this place! It's nice to find a pizza place that still allows you to eat Vegan and gluten free. The atmosphere is very modern and eco-friendly at the same time. Try the Vegan pizza! You'd never guess it was Vegan. [REVIEW_8] This place is great; even for vegetarians.  The food is fresh and delicious.  The sauces are fantastic.  The staff are courteous and helpful.  My daughter and son-in-law live in nearby Lansdale and it seems as if we stop here for a meal at least once every time we visit them. [REVIEW_9] This place is great.  Michelle is the best hostess.  What I really love is all the food combos.   It's amazing!  The beef bulgogi is the best And so is the miso. [REVIEW_10] BEWARE before you are the next victim! Firestone burned out a cylinder  in a brand new starter on a 2004 Mercedes Benz C230; by the mechanics that dont know what they are doing costing me an extra $500.00 plus; $460.00; with an alternator from AUTO ZONE which is no good and don't last long. I had the starter replaced at Kaufman about a year ago. I have contacted 8 ON MY SIDE and BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU for an investigation on  these dishonest and untruthful employee at Firestone. The car started 3 times at Firestone location with no issues with my starter; after being towed.. The next day I had received a call from an employee about my car's starter was smoking after they repaired an alternator and battery. I wonder what Firestone did to my car.  I had reported that an alternator that was done at Firestone was giving lot of problem 6 months ago; with no help and resolution. I will NEVER return to any Firestone or Firestone on Bruce B. Downs and I am disappointed and filing a complaint for justice. [REVIEW_11] Three out of four times I came for servicing (oil change; tire replacement; and inspection) I had an early morning appointment and was told they probably couldn't get the job done....it got done; but took several hours. Today; I went in for oil change (no appointment) ready to drop my car off for the day and was told (after waiting in line for 25 min) that there were no available appointments for 3 days. This location clearly can't handle basic servicing; so they surly won't  have to worry about my car anymore. [REVIEW_12] Came here for the great vegetarian options; but left very dissatisfied. Burrito was unseasoned; nothing inside only rice; and black beans. I wouldn't come here again.  Definitely not real Mexican; and customer service was horrible. [REVIEW_13] I don't know why this place got lower ratings! It is amazing! Food is flavorful. Some of the best Thai food I've ever had. The staff is friendly and the food comes out fast and hot. The fried rice is excellent and so is the green curry. Worth a stop in! [REVIEW_14] I made my appointment a few days in advance; which they had no trouble accommodating. When I arrived; they already had my paperwork filled out; I just had to sign.   Andra ran me through some of the automated tests. While waiting for Dr. Dinh; she helped me pick out frames from their huge collection. She answered all my questions and was very knowledgable.   After a short time; I was brought back to the office. After some tests it turns out my eyes are worse than my old doctor led me to believe. The doctor put drops in my eyes; then sent me out to wait for them to dilate. While waiting; I finished up my frames and they ordered my glasses. After that I finished up with the doctor and left.   My new glasses were ready in two days; and I didn't realize how badly I needed them.  All around; this was a great experience! Everyone is super friendly and helpful. [REVIEW_15] This place is so freaking good. I haven't been to New Orleans in 5 years and I still talk/think about this place. I used to work at Zeitgeist Arts Center (across the street) and ate lunch here all the time.  Not only is the food delicious; you are also contributing to the community it's so great.  After Katrina; I called all of my friends to see if they were ok and then the next question I asked is; how is Cafe Reconcile! I love it that much.  The crawfish bisque and the gumbo where my everyday favorites. Followed by their daily changing menu of pork chops; fried chicken; catfish and po'boys. I always ended my meal with the the Banana Foster's Bread Pudding. I have been to a lot of restaurants in the U.S. and this is by far one of the best.  I recommend it to anyone visiting or living in New Orleans; not to mention it's dirt cheap!!!!  Downside: It's only open 'till 2pm. Get there at 11:30 to beat the lunch crowd.",7
48,"[REVIEW_1] Wife absolutely loved the scramble.  They have children toys and books.  My son read a book while we waited for our food.  I got the breakfast sandwich and it was decent but I felt toast was too crispy.  Im just being picky its a nice breakfast cafe with moderate prices.  Id prefer to give it 4 stars but my wife wouldnt stop talking about how much she loved her breakfast so Im going with a 5. [REVIEW_2] Great service and awesome food!!!! We go here all the time. Each time it is excellent! Very very Stellar [REVIEW_3] I have been coming here for many years - great operation and great people!  I have been to many places across the globe and this operation has the largest area to jet around in and have fun.  For the best fun; go as early in the morning as you can - just like water skiing; when the water is like glass.  Don't forget to bring your cell phone with you and take pictures - great pictures and great screen savers to remember your fun! [REVIEW_4] Come hungry. The food is just perfect. Fast; warm and well prepared. Service with a smile in a comfortable atmosphere.  Great music but not too loud. I had the pulled pork tacos and nachos while my family stuck with. More standard BBQ options in pulled pork sandwiches. In the end we left full and happy. They were busy but we had no trouble finding a large table. This is a must eat if your visiting the Nashville area. [REVIEW_5] My favorite place for Italian eats! Have been going for the past 10 years and have never left disappointed. I recommend the steak bites with gorgonzola cheese dip appetizer and the cannelloni with rose sauce. I usually prefer the lounge to the restaurant because it has a great laid-back vibe; awesome music; excellent service and is generally not too busy. Oh! And the lounge also has free popcorn and board games every night. The Jasper Ave location pales in comparison; so make sure to go to the South one. Also; it's never a bad idea to go for the Sunday pasta special that's a giant family style plate of 5 different pastas for about $13 per person (of parties of 2 or more). All the snaps for this place. [REVIEW_6] First of all; I think this might be my first Yelp review about ""fast food."" It's not a genre I ever eat unless I'm forced to on a road trip.  However; I am from Buffalo; NY; and am a chicken-finger connoisseur; so I decided to give this place a chance.  Additionally; it was on a road trip of sorts.  We had been at the beach all day and were halfway back home to central Tampa.  The service is amazing!  I have never seen fast-food workers who take so much pride in their jobs.  These people were drinking the Zaxby's cool-aid!  They seemed more like Disney employees than fast-food workers.  Both a female counter gal and a male (possible the manager/franchisee) went out of their way to make sure we liked everything.    The food was a solid 4 stars; but my review overall is rounded up for the above mentioned points.  We had the chicken finger sandwiches on Texas toast.  While the chicken fingers themselves were super juicy and moist; the Texas toast was too greasy to eat them on.  I love sauce and enjoyed the variety.  We tried the Zax; hot honey mustard; insane hot and ranch.  What is missing from the sauce variety; for me; is a spicy bbq and blue cheese.  Serving ranch with hot sauce is an insult to the folks in Buffalo that created the cuisine.  Aside from the bread and sauce small issues; I really enjoyed our meal.  Additionally; it was so cheap!!  $12 and change for 2 meals with drinks.    I am a fan!  This place doesn't quite hit all the marks of Buffalo-Inspired food; but it does a pretty good job of putting a southern twist on chicken fingers! [REVIEW_7] Aroy Thai is the newest addition to the Thips Thai/Sala Thai famly and does not disappoint!  It is located in a new strip mall just off highway 64's Green Mount  Rd. exit in O'Fallon; IL (less than a half hour drive from St. Louis).  It is nicely decorated; simple; earthy; and contemporary.  They have a few Chinese items on the menu; but it is primarily Thai.  I had the pleasure of doing a curry taste test at a recent Thai festival in Florrisant and Sala Thai was the best by far.  It is good to know their cook is carrying on the good cooking at a newer & nicer location!    Today; we sampled the tofu yellow curry; pad Thai; Thai sweet & sour shrimp; & Thai cashew chicken.  The Thai version of these dishes has more complex flavor combinations and is lighter and more delicious than simlar dishes from some of their Asian counterparts.  I loved it all!  Vegetarians will like Aroy; as well.  They have a large selection of interesting and tasty vegetarian items.  The food service is a wee bit slow and the items are priced a little high; but it is absolutely yummy!  My only real complaint is that it is small and they get packed early.  So give yourself some time.  It still amazes me that the four best Thai restaurants in the region are in the Metro East.  Come on St. Louis; can't we do better? [REVIEW_8] Wow where do I even begin?? Remember Spicoli from Fast Times at Ridgemont High? OK well that was basically our waiter; Rich. He was EFFIN HILARIOUS! We heard the following phrases during dinner:  ""Wha wha?!"" ""This shiz is going to be awesome!"" ""Here are your vagtables.""  There were so many other gems; but honestly I can't even remember. Regardless; we were there for a birthday and Rich went out of his way to make our experience special. We were giggling all night and his persona.  We had the onion tarte and brussel sprouts to share and I had the Grilled Mahi. Honestly the descriptions on the menu don't even serve the food justice. Mahi with caper butter? Sounds rather ordinary. But no that's where you'd be wrong. It was so good I actually wiped my clean; which I NEVER do. It was served with kale; but not regular kale salad. These were more like spiced kale chips. I was like HOW DO I MAKE THESE AT HOME??? I wanted a bag to take with me just so I could snack on them.  The birthday cake was a little piece of chocolatey heaven. I'm not sure what it was but it tasted like flourless chocolate cake with ice cream. It was super moist and dense. Not too bitter and not too sweet.   When I go back to New Orleans; Luke's will definitely be on my go to list. [REVIEW_9] This will change your life! I absolutely enjoyed my snoball and I am itching to return. Hooked! Stuffed cheesecake is the best! [REVIEW_10] Great experience with Chris's operation. He was easy to communicate with; he and his crew are pleasant to work with; and he really seems to know his stuff. Highly recommend! [REVIEW_11] Excellent service at this port of subs. Line gets extremely long on the weekends but it moves quickly. Always fresh and yummy. [REVIEW_12] Wonderful!!!!!!    Best place I have ever been!!  Dr. Lore is amazing! [REVIEW_13] Fantastic comfort food.  The mac n cheese is incredible as an appetizer!  The Thanksgiving Dinner is probably my favorite entr√©e but the others I have had are very well done.  The atmosphere is 70s shabby chic and very inviting.  My only criticism would be that some dining areas are a little crammed but overall this facility is a fun Center City restaurant.  Very enjoyable. [REVIEW_14] This place is something out of a sci-fi movie. I went in with a broken iPhone 5s screen that I needed to get replaced and I swear; when I turned around to look at phone cases; this guy must have popped out 4 more arms and used telekinetic powers to disassemble and reassemble the phone with the new iPhone screen. By the time I got done looking at phone cases on the wall (approximately 63 seconds) I turned to walk back to the counter to watch him repair my phone; but he already turned back to his normal human form with two arms and all the phone parts he had flying around with his telekinetic powers have been put away already as he was walking back to the counter to hand me the phone back. If you need a phone fixed; and fixed fast; I highly recommend going here; but I wouldn't recommend breaking your phone on purpose to try and catch a picture of the experience; by the time you get your camera out; the phone will be fixed already and he will be asking you if you want to pay by cash or credit. [REVIEW_15] I came here to get a tattoo for the Indymoca.  They were polite; fast and awesome.  This is not my normal tattoo shop but I would totally give them an opportunity to tattoo me again.    Thanks for the artwork.",15
49,[REVIEW_1] Michael who took my phone order and greeted me was very polite and professional! That's hard to find- great customer service! Good job whoever hired him! [REVIEW_2] Very friendly; professional; and helpful people work here. I find a great piece of furniture -- good quality and in very good shape -- that didn't break my budget. BONUS: they offer very affordable interior design services as well. [REVIEW_3] This review is strictly based on Leslie - an employee at the Goleta store.  She has been very rude on two separate visits to the store.  We entered this evening; and I was so insulted by her behavior I left without ordering the cake for my son's birthday.  We love the cakes and come in pretty often.  I will not come in any more if Leslie is working. [REVIEW_4] The donuts are amazing but you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't order something with the praline bacon. The egg; bacon biscuit is as delicious as it is instagram worthy. The coffee holds its own too. District Donuts was the highlight of our visit so far. [REVIEW_5] Severely over charged for 2 sno-balls & my order was wrong. $8 for an 8oz with gummy bears and a 20oz with condensed milk? Puh-lease. My 20oz was supposed to be stuffed but I didn't know it wasn't stuffed until after digging in! Booooooo [REVIEW_6] All I really want to say is why even have a restaurant if your not even going to challenge yourself and strive for quality. Needless to say; everything that was ordered was down right awful. Never again.... [REVIEW_7] I can't say enough good things.   Their Gyros are amazing.  We stopped in the bakery on the way home.  I had the Chocolate Kok and it was really good.  5 stars! [REVIEW_8] Called in to pick up my order but when I arrived they acted as though they never spoke to me. I was told I'd have to wait an extra 10 minutes on top of the 15 minutes of previous waiting. The food was undercooked and the service staff was incredibly rude. I'll never return to this place. [REVIEW_9] This place doesn't want your business!! Try to call in a take-out order and they'll ignore the phone; direct you to their app (they've actually refused to take my order over the phone) or require a credit card to place an order. Going there is no picnic either. Your clothes will smell like you worked the kitchen. Bring headphones if you do go because there's no music and the noise is deafening. Constant noise from the fry cutting machine and sirens going off when fries are done. The burgers taste OK but the fries are greasy and undercooked. Expect diarrhea. I tried to give zero stars but Yelp doesn't allow that! [REVIEW_10] After getting my car damaged in a minor hit and run; I was told that Calvin's does great work at an affordable price. I used to live very close to the shop and was happy I could give my old neighborhood's shop some business. I called ahead and set a time; Calvin was very nice and professional. When I got there; he helped me right away. He started doing the estimate and started asking questions. While talking; I told him I already had a claim in for the damage. He immediately changed his tone; refusing to finish the estimate. Insisting my insurance company would not accept his estimate. This was very confusing since I already had my insurance company's estimate and the cash was in my account. I tried to explain it to him but he wouldn't listen to what I was saying. This was just a bad experience. [REVIEW_11] I had called at 630 tonight to see what time they were open until tonight due to the snow. I was told 10. I got there at 830 and even with a packed restaurant they would not seat us because 'they close at 9 tonight' why was I told 10? I also drove about 15-20 min just to get there so waste of time and gas. The fact we were turned away is rude and unprofessional; I get the early closing but maybe  they should inform the girl answering the phone. [REVIEW_12] If I could give negative stars I would. Terrible service. No one acknowledged me for over 10 minutes and that's only because I was leaving. The other customers told me don't bother ordering because I've been waiting over 30 minutes. [REVIEW_13] The best little spot for dinner or lunch in Kenner. The gumbo or turtle soup are great ways to start your meal. I firmly believe the turtle soup at Harbor seafood is better than Commanders Palace. If you don't want soup to start look hard at the frog legs. All the poboys are good; the oyster or half and half seafood are the way to go. The boiled shrimp or crawfish are size able portions and seasoned just right. Always take a look at the daily specials; the cooks are always whipping something up worth considering. Lastly Abita beer is always cold and cheap. [REVIEW_14] Disaster! Avoid! Restaurant is extremely dated & service poor. Food is mediocre a best. Chicken parm was dark brown around edges & sauce had a weird after taste; almost like it had come from a can/tin. Instead of spaghetti; I had penne. Penne was terrible; pretty much crunchy with same strange tasting sauce as chicken parm. Would never go back! Avoid this place!! [REVIEW_15] Customer service at its finest; combined with great food and a diverse menu.  Always a good experience since I've been going there the last 2 years.  Misha genuinely cares about her customers and takes the time to get to know them (by name).  The wake-up breakfast wrap is the best!,6
50,"[REVIEW_1] We are from Hawai'i and know good sushi! First off; for the price you pay for all you can eat; you cannot beat it! The service is awesome; sushi chef if spot on and the food is 'Ono-licious (Hawaiian for DELICIOUS). I cannot say enough about the presentation; so you're just gonna have to stop by and see for yourself! I give this sushi joint a ten star!!! Will be back again when we return next year! Enjoy! [REVIEW_2] Absolutely stress free car buying experience at Montgomeryville Acura. I was in and out with my pre-owned car in about an hour. My rep Thomas Massi was knowledgeable; experienced; and helpful throughout the process. The car was priced lower than KBB and I got exactly what I expected without the stress. Would definitely recommend! [REVIEW_3] This place is a great find one block from the beach. The room was clean and has a contemporary seaside decor. The continental breakfast was fresh homemade assortment. The managers/owners Jennifer and Greg are very accommodating and friendly. [REVIEW_4] Nice to receive a message from Kerry @ the Whole Foods team. Promised to send a gift card due to the bad sausage. Never received. Guess she is just a person who pretends they care. [REVIEW_5] What a wonderful and unique experience. This was an excellent excursion. Wonderful food. Great service! The dessert bar/bakery is worth the trip by itself. Wide menu variety; so there are many choices for everyone. For the kids- hot dogs etc. this place specializes in Greek food; and there are many choices. For the Greek food afficuinado; to the novice. It was excellent! This is a Can't talk. Will call or text later miss spot if you are near Tarpon Springs. Do not miss the amazing bakery! This is a popular spot; so expect to wait a bit. The wait for us was not unreasonable. 5 people; we waited about 10 minutes. So worth the wait. [REVIEW_6] One of our absolute favorite breakfast places - EVAH! Located in a strip mall; its look can be deceiving. But; make no mistake Ghini's is the real deal. We have been here for breakfast and lunch several times a month. We have yet to try their Fri dinner; but that is on our bucket list.   There can be a bit of a wait on the weekends for breakfast; but they have a nice set up of water; etc.; while you wait. The servers are attentive to getting your name on the list promptly. The food is well worth the wait - it is always fresh and cooked to order. We have never been disappointed. I love the Florentine omelet and my husband loves the eggs Proven√ßale. We also enjoy the Croque Monsieur. I find most of Ghini's fare to be light; fresh; and healthy; which is what we prefer over heavy; carb laden monstrosities - but that is just us. My son loves the French toast and heavier omelets.   They are a pet friendly place allowing dogs on the patio (leashed); which we find endearing. There is also a bakery right next door - not sure if they are affiliated/partners - or separate - but we enjoy eating our breakfast and then grabbing some baked goods to take home.   It's a nice; laid back way to spend a weekend morning with a great cup of coffee; and good; fresh; tasty food. There is a reason she has been in business 20+ years. [REVIEW_7] St Mary's is always my first stop when getting into Tucson. Yes sometimes the wait is a little long but always worth it. I have never had a bad dish yet. I have been coming here for the last 18yrs and will continue to return. Portions are big so there is always enough to take home for later. [REVIEW_8] So here recently the staff has apparently decided to just close up shop whenever they feel like it regardless of posted business hours; sometimes 7:30; sometimes sooner.  Makes you wonder if the owner or franchisee knows that.   The place improved for awhile and now it appears to be headed down hill again [REVIEW_9] Been to MOD pizza once and the experience was something to remember. We went around lunch time and the service was great. I love how you can choose what toppings you want and the good guys at MOD pizza bake to order. Defiantly will be returning in the near future to MOD Pizza! [REVIEW_10] We hired Terra as the florist for our wedding and were very pleased with her work. We liked that she took the time to run through the venue with my husband and really tried to understand our needs and accommodate our budget. The florals for the wedding came out beautiful and we loved the draping for the ceremony and the reception. The only concern we had was that some of flowers in the bride's and the bridesmaids' bouquets started wilting during the day; but we understand that it is because the flowers were in full bloom and it could also have been due to the heat. Overall; we were happy we found Terra for our wedding! [REVIEW_11] I had no idea what I was stepping into when I walked in. The restaurant has closed rooms rather than being open concept. It looked so small at first! But if you come with a large enough party; maybe you'll be able to get a room for yourselves. The restaurant has a pioneer hunter-Native American history kind of feel. It was enough to make me feel like I went back in time. They also have real fire places throughout the restaurants; which I enjoyed.  The restaurant is known for featuring game animals on their menu. I went at dinner time; and they had wild boar; venison; and rabbit. The dinner menu also featured fish; chicken; pork chop steaks; lamb; and ribs. I had the rabbit; which I thought was okay. They took the meat off the bones and prepared it in a way to make ""scallions."" It was kind of tough and hard to chew. I have had better rabbit at other restaurants. I had a bite of the venison; and it was delicious. It didn't have a gamey taste; so don't be afraid to try it! Dinner also comes with a basked of bread; salad; chili; or soup of the day.   The staff was friendly and honest. When asking about the menu; the lady who took our order told us her favorites; what was popular; and which meals were smaller compared to others.   Warning: For those who have their smartphones surgically attached to their hand; you do not get service out here. [REVIEW_12] This place was so delicious! The coffee was great; the servers were all friendly and kind. They even accommodate very well to GF allergies. I am so impressed! We will definitely be back here more in the future!! [REVIEW_13] Excelente comida mediterr√°nea! El gyro es buen√≠simo y la ensalada griega de las mejores q he comido.  Las porciones son bastantes generosas. Sitio recomendado al 100%  vendr√© cada vez que pueda [REVIEW_14] Great service. Awesome ice cream and water ice. Love going there. Staff is very pleasant and helpful with my family. Parking on site and that is great. Keep up the great job :-) [REVIEW_15] I had to make a stop to get one of the staples; the hand grenade!  This drink will get you twisted so be ready in advance. I had two and my night was filled with dancing; singing; laughter; and all the makings of an incredible evening in New Orleans.   Your drink will last you a while and when you feel like you're finished it seems to be more waiting. Great place and great staff!  They were quick getting you in and getting you back out. Cheers!",13
51,"[REVIEW_1] I definitely won't be coming back here. Long story short; I scheduled an appointment online to have the transmission and differential fluid changed on my pilot. I arrived on time; and I was told it would take approximately 2 hours for completion; I also said I wanted an oil change; but "" full synthetic"". He said it would be $20 more; I said okay. When it was finally done and I was ready to check out; my advisor (Brandon) give me the total cost; which was double than what I expected and paid for in the past. I asked him what was all done; he said; ""they completed a transmission flush instead of the regular drain and refill"". I told him that's not what I wanted or asked for. He went on to say ""it was good for the car and whatever""; like I'm some kind of idiot. First of all Honda doesn't recommend doing a transmission flush and secondly; its almost triple what you would normally pay for a standard transmission fluid change. On top of that they didn't even do a full synthetic oil change it was just a blend. I didn't have time to argue with him because I was already late for an appointment; but I have the email showing what I originally asked for; so I'll be calling my bank soon. [REVIEW_2] The Blind Tiger is tucked in near some antique shops in Ybor City; unassuming to the eye walking by it save its awesome sign (of a blind tiger; of course) painted on the window. The interior is warm and inviting and the focus is on coffee; tea; and fresh baked goods with some clothing and homewares also for sale. What really impressed me however was that there is as much emphasis on the tea as the coffee: too often at coffeehouses tea is simply an afterthought and nothing more. Not here. There are about six selections of tea and they roughly cover the gamut of black; oolong; and green teas you'd hope to find. The coffee I had was very good and the baked goods include such favorites as banana bread; cakes; and cinnamon rolls--the latter apparently being what Blind Tiger is most known for locally.   Overall it's a very neat little place and the interior is one which makes you feel no expense was spared to create a haven from the loudness and bustle of Ybor City; where it seems every other business is a bar or club. As much as I love bars; it's great to have a place that provides a degree of quiet and serenity. [REVIEW_3] To the reviewer who said 'best Carne Asada burrito ever'; absolutely agree! It's yummy; and huge. The Carne Asada in general is excellent at this restaurant. Their shrimp is excellent and their tacos are good. Honestly I haven't had anything here that I didn't like. The food is really good and very authentic Mexican. Before taking your order they bring you chips and salsa. The chips are authentic themselves; which means they're not all salty as you would expect American chips to be. But you don't need them salty when there's salsa; plus they bring you limes which are an excellent addition if you squeeze them over the chips.   The staff is very friendly and helpful but not in your face as at some restaurants. The building is nice; and it's a really pleasant atmosphere. Plus the food doesn't take very long to come.  It's definitely not a fancy restaurant; so if you're looking for someplace for a special occasion you might want to look elsewhere. But it's clean; neat and extremely relaxing inside. So if you're looking for good Mexican food; this is definitely the place to go! [REVIEW_4] been to nearly all the high-end steak houses in Philly; this might just be my favorite.  Right up there with Barclay Prime; though two totally different joints.  This is your classic old school place.  Waiter we had was amazing; and that never hurts your experience.  Everything we ate was great - apps; sides; meats; desserts.  100% I recommend getting the prime rib.  We got a steak and a prime rib and split the two.  they didn't name the place 'the prime rib' for no reason; right?  Probably the best prime rib I've ever had; was way better than their filet; makes it a unique experience from the other steak joints in town. [REVIEW_5] Myron and perma ceram were recommended to me by a contractor/friend.  My tub had some rust and chipping which was explained to Myron when we were scheduling the job.  The price seemed reasonable; so I said okay.  Mike came out a few days later and was a nice guy.  He took a look at the tub and said the repairs would be no problem.  He said he can fix the rust and the tub would look like new. After he was finished and he was paid I was handed a receipt/invoice. Once Mike leaves;  I read what he handed me and at the end it states there is no warranty for rust.  What!  Why wouldn't you say that to me.  I just would have bought a new tub for the price.    Once the tub dried; I could get a closer look and there were several areas it appeared weren't sanded down so there were ridges along several edges.  Not a new tub; so I could live with that.  Fast forward; a couple months went bye and what do you know; I could see the rust coming through. So I call Myron to schedule an appointment and after months of run around; I get a call asking if they can come Christmas Eve. Seriously!  Needless to say they finally said they were too busy to come to the city.  Essentially go pound sand.    Beware. [REVIEW_6] Bottomless mimosas; sangrias;  and bloody Mary's for $15 at Sunday Brunch. Expect a wait. The crawfish beignet was delicious... flaky bread stuffed with crawfish and cheese; topped with jalape√±o aioli. Yum. [REVIEW_7] Excellent! Love the location-- fun upscale decor. Service was perfect-- knowledgeable; respectful; and fun. I'm sure this place will end up busy and packed; but for now; it feels like a secret I want to keep! We ordered small plates-- flatbread pizza; butternut squash soup; and house salads. Dinner was filet medallions; salmon; burger and tuna poke. Everyone loved their meals and drinks. We will be back soon! [REVIEW_8] Bread pudding... AHHHH-MAZING!!! The best I've ever had!  Also had the eggplant lasagna and greens; very good and super filling! [REVIEW_9] I would really like to try this place but every time I show up they are unexpectedly closed! The first time I showed up I was told they were closed for a Spring Spruce up and would be open on the 11th. I left a little annoyed because there was no indication of this on their website; which I had used to look them up and browse the menu. I later discovered they had something up on their Facebook page about being closed; but seeing as those I don't have a Facebook; this was of no benefit to me. Today (March 15th) I drove all the way over only to discover a sign on the door stating they will be closed the remainder of the week! This time I checked their Facebook and there was no information regarding the extended closure. In fact it was a bit confusing because they had posts advertising the re-opening and even pictures posted of people eating there for a brunch event just the other day. Is this some kind of secret society of delicious eatery? I really wish I knew. Poor communication on the businesses side of things has made me feel like I probably won't be giving these guys a try. If I do muster up the fortitude to drive clear across town again I will definitely be calling ahead to make sure they are open. I suggest you do the same. [REVIEW_10] I really enjoyed this place. Very interesting menu; great drink selection; loved the decor/ambience and our kiwi bartender was great. I will definitely come back next time I am in town. [REVIEW_11] Little puzzled by some of the negative reviews. I ordered the BBQ sub this afternoon and it was pretty epic. Would definitely order again! [REVIEW_12] So disappointed with this place. Read great reviews and had high hopes. We ordered Singapore noodles; honey garlic chicken; chicken balls & Chicken fried rice. Very bland taste; most of it went to the bin. For all you Irish people that are expecting it to be as good as home; it most certainly is nothing like it. [REVIEW_13] F*** this place I will never come back here; the people told me to pay before they did my manicure; I mean I know not many black males or males in general come in to get these things done; but dam. [REVIEW_14] We waited 25 minutes to order a glass of water & 10 minutes later I had to go to the bar to ask if our waitress could come over so we could order food. She was very unfriendly and felt like we were an inconvenience. The temperature was very cold and uncomfortable. Our food was barely warm and slipped on the plate. Certainly will not be back!! [REVIEW_15] Guy at the counter was rude; the place was filthy; and all around horrible! Would/will not recommend this place at all!",8
52,"[REVIEW_1] I was born in New York parents are Dominican and this place is FABULOUS!  Went with hubby early on a friday night at 4 pm which they only have cocktails; appetizer & salads.  We started with the house salad with vinegrette on the side & feta cheese - delish then dominican longanisa; tostones & chimichuri sauce - amazing! Hubby enjoyed his sangria but my drink was to citrus for me - think it was the huming bird - not sure. After 5 hubby asked for the mofongo which comes with shrimp but he asked to substitue for beef barbacoa instead and it was very good.  I had the bonelss short rib and this was so soft and tender; hubby kept sticking his fork into my plate! Came with 3 different potatoes - 1 mashed - YUM.  Then if things couldn't get any better we had the plantain bake as dessert and it was the best thing on earth.  Consistency of apple pie but made with sweet plaintains instead.  I'm taking mom there this week.  Hubby complained it was a bit pricey - i never care about paying for good food & ambience.  Loved the spanish music playing too!!!  Who cares about outside - they have a few parking spots right in front for us early birds! [REVIEW_2] A few years ago I saw a line of glasses in Raleigh that I loved. Although I live in Maine; I was in Philadelphia for a visit and searched for a store that carried that line. I read about Eye-site and decided to check them out. Wow; what a great experience. Gene guided me to styles that best fit my face and once I selected a pair he adjusted them exactly to fit me. I went home; saw my eye doctor; updated my prescription and sent it to Gene. Today I received the glasses. They are so cool looking; very fine quality; fit me perfectly and the vision is just right.  I couldn't be happier. I only wish I live in Philadelphia. But perhaps I'll make a special trip just to shop there. It's worth it. Thank you Gene!!!!! [REVIEW_3] Great place to brunch! The food is so damn delicious and the biggest perk for us is parking! There is indoor and outdoor spaces available but we always do the outside in the summer. The  view from the patio in the back is great bc you overlook kelly drive and the river. [REVIEW_4] worst dealer by far stay clear of this place brought my van in for servicethe tech 35602 has made me wast lots of money and time after all the worst he has done i have the same issues he just had me replace my engine for nothing it still broken and my old engine was fine low milage ran great i took a chance but feel as if this guy is just throwing parts at my van rather then properly diagnostic time save your money go to falcony in speed way   update found techs name is josh like mine haha but stay clear of him [REVIEW_5] Food is great. Service is wonderful; yet a little slow. We really enjoy dining here and we love the tacos and bowls. [REVIEW_6] So we walk in and the receptionist Vann was   absolutely incompetent at his job;  we simply asked if there was any vacancy to which he replied with out any computer or paperwork check ""NO""  so we walk out and do a online search and booked a room to that same hotel!  We Came back confronted him about it to which he replied ""he didn't know anything about it""   Well Van if you don't know the only thing you are being paid to do; I suggest a you find a new profession. [REVIEW_7] When we lived a block away we constantly ate here after church. It was good back then and now it's even better. The chicken and waffle is superb topped with sausage gravy and scrambled eggs. Don't get no better. The wife had the eggs Benedict this morning and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  Great atmosphere hardly ever a line which is weird because it sits inside the Blake hotel on st Charles.   Great staff very friendly and quick. A little on the high side for breakfast but I like it better than the world famous mothers restaurant down the street. [REVIEW_8] The catfish; chicken; gumbo and mac &a cheese are all to die for. We are the lunch buffet and everything was piping hot and fresh. This place was recommended by a local in the neighborhood we are staying in and it was so worth it! [REVIEW_9] The absolute best brunch I've ever had!  The mimosas were perfection and the service was amazing.  Will definitely be back! [REVIEW_10] Okay; I'm obsessed with the chocolate pancakes from IHOP but they are not worth it when the service is SHIT. My server comes to the table asked me what I wanted to order for a drink; I ask a few questions about the mimosas. He said ""No just Orange juice and Champagne"" I say then I'll getting something else AND HE WALKED AWAY BEFORE I COULD FINISH MY SENTENCE. I was appalled. This man was older so he had no excuse for his ignorance. I am so disappointed with this establishment. If I could give negative stars I would. Do not go here; it is not worth it. [REVIEW_11] All I can really say is WoW.  The flavors were fantastic.  Quattro Formaggi; Crudo and Sea Salt and Rosemary.  The service was great.  The open pizza area was great to watch these guys at their work.  Beer list is awesome.  What else can I say.  Go.  Eat Pizza the way it should have always been. [REVIEW_12] I am in town for work and a few of my local counterparts brought me to this restaurant. I wasn't sure what to expect but can I honestly say it was far better than so expected. The crab and bacon rangoon was excellent and the pork couldn't have been better. The service was also excellent. I will definitely be visiting this place again. [REVIEW_13] I created this yelp account just so I could write a review for this place. So I was on my way through Nashville while on a trip to Texas from Maine with my girlfriend and decided to stay in Nashville for the night. We stopped by this restaurant and started off with some drinks which were both fantastic beers that were recommended by our waitress. We then ordered our burgers; I ordered the chili-chili bang bang and the Benton's bacon mac and cheese and my girlfriend got the buy the farm and truffle tots. Now here's where things got interesting and the reason why this place gets a 5 instead of 4 from me...... I got my food (which was cooked perfectly and had plenty of flavor) and my girlfriend took a bite into her burger and pulled out what appeared to be plastic from it. We politely told our waitress and she took the burger right back and had them make a new one for us. The manager (I believe; it may have been the chef) comes out and apologized and you could tell he was very remorseful and that this is not a regular occurrence. He explained that the wax surrounding the cheese must not have come off and fixed the burger immediately and triple checked everything again. He even came out with two extra sides of tots and quickly brought her burger back. Then to top off this already incredibly generous gesture; they comped her entire meal for us (which they didn't have to do; for after that level of service I would've been glad to pay full price). We made sure that we still tipped over 20% of the original price of the meal before some of the food was comped for the excellent service. I went in to try and shake that gentleman's hand but he had gone out back right as I was leaving. I would recommend this place to anyone of my friends who are traveling to Nashville; and I will definitely make a repeat trip the next time I'm here [REVIEW_14] Went in to look for a new bed. Salesman was awesome. No pressure to buy. Just facts about mattresses. Bed was perfect for us. Delivery was prompt and fast. Would buy here again. [REVIEW_15] Bob Diehl is one of the best mechanics I've ever dealt with. I had a Mercedes Benz that I'd owned for years and only drove in the Summer months. It always started right up after being in storage for the Winter one year it was somewhat hard starting. I took it to the M-B dealer who kept it for three days and had the mechanic come and talk to me when I picked it up. The mechanic tried to convince me that there was nothing wrong and that was the way it should be; I asked around and learned about Bob. I brought the car to him; he fixed the problem and informed me that the car had three cold start systems and two weren't working right. Minor repairs set them right and the car stared as it always had. Bob charged me little or nothing for the work and I then became a loyal client. I eventually sold the car and was upset that Bob didn't work on any other marques. I understand that he may; now.   I'd buy a used M-B if for no other reason than I'd know I'd have a great mechanic who could work on it. He is extremely knowledgeable; highly competent; and his prices are very reasonable.",12
53,"[REVIEW_1] The Mona Lisa Lounge is an awesome spot and gem here in Louisiana. My boyfriend and I stopped to have a couple drinks before our swamp tour. Not only were we greeted with the best southern hospitality the service; food; and drinks were superb. The Bourdain and seafood balls were incredible. The cook came out to serve us personally. We were given beads and plenty of great conversation. The owner Tony was personable and genuinely wanted us to enjoy ourselves and that we did. This will become a staple in my visits to Louisiana. [REVIEW_2] Gave this store one star only because I had to in order to post a review. Went here last week to get a new phone. Service was indifferent to say the least. Staff was condescending and barely polite. Not a good experience. [REVIEW_3] Recently moved into their delivery area and called in an order Friday night while my wife and I painted and pulled down wallpaper.  One large specialty pizza was ordered and I was told 30-45 minutes.    Our house is on the same street as their store so no way the driver got lost.  After an hour and a half with no pizza and no call; I called back to cancel the order.  A man answered the phone in the typical ""pick-up or delivery"" fashion.  I stated that I would like to cancel a delivery order I placed more than 90 minutes ago.  Without asking my name; address; or order; he simply said ""okay"" and hung up on me.  Awful customer service!  I never got to try the pizza; but a missed opportunity to gain a new customer in the area.  I won't be giving them another chance. [REVIEW_4] Pros:  - Convenient for when you're looking to feed an overworked sleep-deprived film crew at 6AM on a Sunday on a tight budget  Cons: - Food is so bad that even overworked sleep-deprived film crew would rather starve  - Eggs tasted like paper; toast tasted like cardboard; potatoes felt like decomposing fruits (not that I would know)  I cannot understand how they can mess up the most basic sides.. but hey; I guess they're not exactly known for their eggs; toast; and potatoes  Paying a bit more for Dunkin' Donuts sandwiches/croissants is much more worth it. [REVIEW_5] Totally non-dog friendly; unlike 95% of Manayunk.   Ashame since it's accross from the dog park.  I'll be giving my $ to the dog friendly Main Street Market from now on. [REVIEW_6] Came here for brunch at 1 on a Saturday while visiting from out of town. Drinks are good but come out slow and it took over an hour to bring out our appetizer The service is really slow. Our server seemed very overwhelmed but the restaurant wasn't even packed. On a Saturday afternoon with nice weather there should probably be more servers working. Tables are left messy and we actually had to wipe the food off of our table ourselves.  I ordered the steak and eggs and when I asked our server if the eggs could be prepared over easy instead of scrambled; she said she didn't know because they pre scramble the eggs in the morning...  When our food came out it was atrocious. I am appalled that the kitchen would even send it out in the state that it was. 1 burger had an eggshell on it and the other had cold congealed cheese and the bun was twice the size of he burger. The steak and eggs were the size of a side. And the eggs were scrambled...  Advice to management- hire bussers and greet people as they walk in... It's not always obvious when you should seat yourself. Also isn't fair for servers to have to have to apologize for management and kitchen staff not doing their jobs right.  After all was said and done; management gave us $10 gift cards which didn't even cover the cost of our drinks and even our server said 'this is bullshit'. [REVIEW_7] We don't eat at KFC very often. I had the lame idea of trying it again. First off; the cashier; Michelle; had a SERIOUS attitude problem. Rude as the day is long. No smile; no hello; no thank you. Looked like she really hated her job. We told her our food was dine-in. It was put in a to go bag; no plates; butter; sporks; etc. I didn't dare ask for plates. Chicken was under-cooked. Slaw and potatoes were OK. Biscuits fair. Are we going back? NOPE!!! Bad attitudes don't fare well with me. [REVIEW_8] I'm from Jersey & this place has the closest thing to a NY bagel in the Bay Area.   Plus the women who work there have a bit of an attitude that reminds me of the soup place on Seinfeld.  It just adds to the charm.  Go there.  Like every weekend.  Enjoy! [REVIEW_9] Super disappointed in this place! Their service was nice but their breakfast burrito is almost $9 even though its advertised as $6.99 (i didnt get any additions).  I would have been ok with it except the burrito was so puny when it arrived! Almost the same size as the little burritos youd get at a cafeteria on a school campus.  By comparison; super cucas and daily grind are both substantialy larger burritos with better flavor.   From a flavor standpoint it was also subpar; and i ordered a chorizo burrito and they put in some other kind of random pork cut.   Get it together el sitio. Mexican food isn't difficult  and it shouldn't be expensive. [REVIEW_10] Went to have lunch and place had nice ambiance and service was very good and friendly. Then came the food. They had several options. I had the pick three of sausage; brisket and ribs. The two sides were beans and greens. Out of the three meats the sausage was the least worse. All were dry and the sides did not have favors I would expect. I did not like anything. You even had to pay for bread.  I tried covering them up with the bbq sauces however even those were strange tasting. The sweet was pure molasses. The house was the only one I could tolerate.  I think they need to hire a cook that has tastebuds. We tried the apple crumble pie for desert and we even threw that away as it had no sweetness at all and no texture.  The price was crazy. Never again. Go to one of the many BBQ places in St. Louis that actually has good food. [REVIEW_11] We just left Mr T's and found them to be seriously overpriced.  For example; a white resin lounger was $40 higher than 3 other places we googled; and another lounger was $150 higher than advertised elsewhere.  For a slice that advertises as having 30% off their prices are still very high.  Seems like they just raised their prices to lower them 30%. [REVIEW_12] This place has the worst customer service! We were the 2nd in line to sell clothing; and by the time they get to ours they don't even look the just start throwing things to the side without even looking at them... They are rude!!! Take your time to drive elsewhere!!! It's worth it to use the gas and pass this place [REVIEW_13] The food and pricing was fine. However; there was a picture of Trump and a positive article about him taped to the wall. I don't go to restaurants with a political view. [REVIEW_14] We recently moved within walking distance of the store.  On my first visit; I found the employees to be no so friendly.  They didn't make eye contact; say hello; can I help you; nothing!  I brushed it off as just a bad day.  Today I went back and that will be my last time.... The deli lady and the cashier were the only employees that spoke to me or make eye contact for that matter.  The people that look like managers don't smile or speak.  The bag boy was hanging on the coke cooler door when I went to the register.  He piled can goods on foil pans that I bought and when I asked him to move them he said ""well I didn't bend them""!  No one offered to take my groceries to my car either.  I'll drive the extra miles to shop at the Publix on Alderman and Alt. 19 in Palm Harbor.  Those people ALWAYS go out of their way to be friendly. [REVIEW_15] I had the pleasure of volunteering for this one in 2016 Military Park. Venue tents were well spread out which helped control the crowds and your line wait. This was a step ahead of a somewhat cramped street styled BrewHaHa. Having the chance to try home brewers was a special treat. Brewers were polite and willing to describe the products in detail. The good indy notable SunKing offered special blends on a timed schedule; which gave you something to shoot for every hour. If you are a true fan; brewers even offer swag at a seemingly discounted price from online! Summertime events like these is what makes living in Indianapolis so much more enjoyable. Go northside!",3
54,"[REVIEW_1] I have never stayed at a hotel so ghetto. Sure the atmosphere is great and very classy looking. However the staff is the opposite. First of all; my friend booked us a suite for the bachelorette party she was planning. They gave us two separate rooms and my friend had to beg for them to be at least next door to each other since they ran out of suites. Then to make up for it; they threw in free valet. The next day her car had been keyed on her door when the valet brought it from the parking garage. Seriously? Worst experience and I certainly won't ever be back. [REVIEW_2] Del Air was responsible for setting up our AC in our newly built home. We noticed a rattling sound before we moved in; so the builder called Del Air to come fix it. They said they did and it seems as though they just lowered the speed of the blower for us not to notice the sound. Well two years later; the sound is back. DO NOT USE THESE SCAMMERS! They also wanted us to PAY them for a FREE extension of the warranty. Thanks for nothing Del Air. We will NEVER use you and I have told my community to avoid your company at all costs. [REVIEW_3] I don't get over here nearly enough. This might be the smallest brewery in New Jersey but it's also the friendliest. Chris and his wife are outstanding hosts. Oh yeah and the beer is just awesome. [REVIEW_4] Wow!  Probably our 4th time at this place and each experience has been amazing!  Our waiter; Peter; was an incredible guide through all the great menu options. Lamb/Kim Chee potstickers were over the top. Highly recommended! [REVIEW_5] Where I think the meat and fish selection looks fine and they carry some exotic meats in the freezer I just cannot recommend this place. I had purchased a Groupon and was pretty excited about trying this place out. When I got there I decided to walk around the entire store to see what kind of goodies I wanted to buy. Once I got around to the back of the store buy the beer; wine and dried goods I started to smell the stench of cigarettes. At first I was willing to write this off as maybe a door was open by the loading dock. But then I walked by the office with the door wide open and two people smoking openly. I choose to ask them why they were smoking in the building and all they could do was write it off as ""smoking in the office"" and ""yeah it's a dirty habit"". Not addressing that it's ILLEGAL in the state of Florida to smoke inside a business like this; you know the whole Indoor Clean Air Act. Besides I don't want to buy what is supposed to be fresh meat and the like in a place that cigarette smoke lingers in the air. The only reason I bought anything was to use my Groupon but on second thought I should have just walked out empty handed.   I don't think they understand the purpose of Groupon. It is designed to get new customers in the door with the goal of becoming regular customers. In this case they scared me away from ever shopping there again. What a shame they could have something pretty nice on their hands otherwise. [REVIEW_6] Of course we know it is not Las Vegas; but per Tripadvisor figured it would be worth going. To sum it all up; it's a castle of secondhand smoke!  We are non smokers and have gone out to clubs which had smoking and could tolerate it more than this place!   We were very disappointed that we could not enjoy ourselves for all the smoke. Soon as some hit the door; they were lighting up cigs. SMH.. Why not invest in some of  those high power fans to vacuum some of this smoke out??? We were not the only patrons cutting our visits short because of this.   Nice looking hotel and heard the buffet was delicious; yet sadly we will never know... Doubt we will  ever come back unless it changes to non-smoking or clear divisions of smoking and non-smoking areas. Oh well; can not win them all. Maybe if some happy competition moves in town; things would be interesting. [REVIEW_7] I am visiting from Chicago and stopped for dinner.  Food is VERY salty which any Thai cook will tell you is a big no no.  It is more Chinese style on stir fry's and they burned the fried rice.  Service very slow also. [REVIEW_8] So glad to find this place! The food is simply delicious! Apple salad is the bomb! Honestly; I tried almost everything on the menu and was not disappointed once. Except for the one time when I tried to order lunch and; they could not place my order because they were extremely busy. Which is NOT a bad thing - the food is just this good! [REVIEW_9] First of all; I have mixed hair; which can be tricky when trying to find a good hairdresser. I went there today; very nervous in order to get a blow out and a trim. Eric was my hairdresser and all I can say is that he is AMAZING! My hair is silky and straight! I will definitely go back! [REVIEW_10] If you go here; beware.  If the bar attended is a blond with the name of Celina; sit at a table and be waited on my someone else.  If the bar attendant is a lady named Jessica; sit at the bar and enjoy the best bartender that I have ever had in my fifty years of drinking.  She will never let you run out of beer.  And the owner opened a bar in Murfreesboro; so his appearances here are few and far between.   Jennifer is the daytime barkeep and also manages the place in the owner's absence.  She does a good job of it; but Celina and one other person behind the bar would never work for me. [REVIEW_11] Guy at the counter was rude; the place was filthy; and all around horrible! Would/will not recommend this place at all! [REVIEW_12] Great ice cream; absolutely terrible service. My son and I went in for ice cream on a Sunday afternoon; so maybe they have their worst staff working on a Sunday. We walked in and were ignored by both people behind the counter. The girl (who seemed drunk) was throwing screwed up napkins around and one of them flew over the counter and hit me. No big deal; but no apology; just more hysterically loud laughter and napkin throwing. The guy noticed my son eyeing the candy and yelled at him not to touch anything. I get it; no one wants sandy little hands in the candy. But he wasn't touching anything; so this was just rude. We stood at the counter and the girl begrudgingly served us; no smile; no greeting; she didn't even look at us. Perhaps she was annoyed we had interrupted her flirting. She ran my card and then turned her back to do some weird dance for her work mate while we stood and waited; more loud shouty laughter. I'm all about a great fun atmosphere and I know I sound like a bore. But when it comes hand-in-hand with a rude attitude towards paying customers; it crosses a line. [REVIEW_13] Yum! This is a great place to go with a few friends to share their delicious and nicely portioned cheese while enjoying a beer from their extensive drink list. 5 stars purely because of how much I loved their cheese selection and appreciated the staff's knowledge of each cheese.  I'd happily go back although this is not a place I'd go to have inexpensive drinks. [REVIEW_14] Just had lunch with family here today. Awful service. First; steaks were not cooked as we had asked. Second; they ran out of our sides and instead of asking us before they brought the food out if we would like to substitute or wait for it to come out with our meal. They just brought out our meal and said it'd be 15 minutes for the rest. Asked for manager; manager trivialized our concern. Tried to explain their communication process as if it wasn't their fault. When I told her that this should have been communicated to us first; she gave up and stated flatly what we wanted her to do. I don't know? Why don't you tell me what you're going to do. Don't expect your customer to handle your problem. As a manager; take initiative and fix the problem. After that; we had a free appetizer on our phone. Waitress took phone instead of writing it down. (Seriously people; this is a liability on your end if the phone breaks or there is privacy issues.) And failed to use it. So charged another person the appetizer in an attempt to hide the fact. Seriously; stay away from this one. Usually have a good time at other Texas Roadhouses. Never going back to this one. [REVIEW_15] Starving after a night on the town. Needed protein for breakfast and these chicken fingers hit the spot!!! Light delicious breading and moist chicken. Cooked perfectly!",6
55,"[REVIEW_1] Horrible customer service. Major attitude problem. Been to many Starbucks in US and in other countries definitely do not follow the Starbucks great customer service model. [REVIEW_2] We love good food and would rather have a fine meal in a mediocre space than a lousy meal in an elegant space.  Alas; our first (and last) experience here gave us a lousy meal in a mediocre setting.  * The space is drab and dreary. * Tables crammed too close together * Noise level excessively high - impossible to have a relaxed conversation; have to compete with too-loud talking at too-close tables; flatware and plates rattling on the stone tabletops * Cheesy; cheap paper napkins at a not-cheap restaurant * Worn; scuffed; cheap diner-type flatware  * Bread that came with the hummus was stale; tasteless * Rice and vegetable accompanied all four entrees - rice tasteless and lukewarm; greens mushy; overcooked; oily and unrecognizable * Entrees rushed out before we had finished our apps * For our wine; we were given old; small; worn-out flute-shaped glasses - totally inappropriate   All in all; an entirely disappointing BYO meal at any cost; but especially so for close to $160 including gratuity for four apps; four entrees; two desserts. [REVIEW_3] $28 for two cheesesteaks and a large gravy fries? Cheesesteaks nothing to write home about either.  If your paying that much the steaks should have been the best. Go to Pete's or Lenny's in the neighborhood; you'll pay less but get more. Once this fad dies down the windows will be boarded up; and this place will be another fly by night outfit. [REVIEW_4] Horrible buffet; they don't have enough toppings.. you have to wait for the pizza.. not recommend it for one hr. Lunch.. [REVIEW_5] Cali did an absolute amazing job on a last minute order for delivery. I needed to get something cheerful; unique; and beautiful delivered to my MIL (who has all those same traits!) as she was in the hospital for a few days. They're all in Santa Barbara; I'm in San Diego; but Cali worked with me by phone and text and in a matter of a few hours had put together the most gorgeous arrangement.  She used a unique piece of pottery from Unurth out of Thousand Oaks and she added an array of colorful succulents for a cheerful look. The sea glass topping she added gave it a soothing vibe. I'm thoroughly impressed with Cali's skill and customer service! The best part is that this arrangement will last well beyond any flowers or balloons that I could have had delivered. [REVIEW_6] Yelp wants you to give stars but this place isn't worth it crap..00000 stars for this pizza hut..I ordered online for delivery. Easy right nope. They messed up the whole order and forgot the wings. Then I called the Manger she barely listen offered no help at all. Just send me out my correct order and take this back. Nope never happened; she sent the driver back out  to get the wrong order still no wing and then refused to refund.. she never brought the right order; don't use your hard earned money here...they really need someone that cares about a job..I'll never order from this place again because if you complain she probably spits in your food..don't waste your time and money..go to the pizza hut on Judge Perez; they are the best..and to the manager; karma a bitch; just wait..and fuck you bitch..have a nice day [REVIEW_7] This place is amazing! My friends and I just happened to stumble upon it; and we felt so lucky. It's delicious; affordable; fresh; and authentic. The people there even gave us a free extra dish just because they wanted us to try it. We tried it and loved it! [REVIEW_8] Great view and the decor and architecture is quite elegant.   I can only comment on the lunch buffet; but it was pretty horrible. It was very akin to cheap catering you might find at a party where the host paired it with a keg of Budweiser.  Service? hahahaha.. ohh.. that was funny. [REVIEW_9] beware of this hotel!!!!! they just approved a policy of charging customers $50 a night for incidentals!!! if you stay for 5 days thats $250 just for incidentals on top of your nightly charge for your stay! are you kidding me!!!! oh yea; if you don't have a credit card  it's double that; yes $100 a night for incidentals!!!!!!! finally; they don't tell you this till you get there at check-in!!!     ps. yes that includes all you cogic people there for the convention!!! [REVIEW_10] Great experience -- second time at Granite City Brewery. Our server Kylie was top notch - great food and drink recommendations; service. We had the the pulled pork waffle sandwich and pepper maple bacon flatbread. Worth another visit real soon! [REVIEW_11] We finally made it to the Best in the West Nugget Rib Cook-Off this year.  We didn't stay as long as I had hoped since food coma set in real quickly but we had a good time nonetheless :)  There were so many rib vendors it just smelled awesome walking around.  They also had a section that sold other goods you'd find at a typical flea market.  Our favorite ribs we tried was definitely Bone Daddy's; the ribs fell off the bone; was not dry at all; and their bar-be-que sauce was totally yum!  Goodi's Lemonade was a great way to wash it all down and the hubby loved how there were many bar/alcohol vendors set up around the cook-off also.  Definitely coming back next year and this time we are not eating at all before we head out. [REVIEW_12] You think Value City; you think cheap value; right? Wrong!   Think Rothman prices with Ashley Furniture pieces. Not a Broyhill in sight.   Negatives: - Entertainment centers and TV stand selection is small; and over priced selection. -Their ""Clearance"" section is laughable and not much of a sale. No one is going to pay $299 for a nicked up coffee table that was originally $350. Go lower.  - Sectionals by themselves average around $1;000 by brands I've never heard of.  - The staff hangs out like a clique chatting in the middle of the store rather than helping customers.  -Dining sets are nothing special and overpriced as well. I've seen the same selection everywhere else at a lower price.  -5% military discount? Ooooh you're going to knock $20 off my sofa!   Only Positive: -They have a few modern pieces.   Overall:  I think they're high for low quality-mediocre furniture. Shop around town. Or if you do find something you must have here; wait for a holiday sale. [REVIEW_13] Food is typical Steak 'n Shake.. My issue here is with the service. Awful; awful; awful. Took my kids for breakfast and waited over 30 minutes for pancakes and eggs. Asked for salsa; ate entire breakfast before it showed up. Coffee refill?  Promised but never delivered. I don't expect McDonald's speed; but this is Steak 'n Shake; not a full service restaurant. Should be able to get in and out relatively quickly. [REVIEW_14] The staff at VIP and Concierge Services is A+.  They took care of all our needs immediately and with grace and charm.  Big thanks to Kevin Brantner for arranging a wonderful weekend for us. [REVIEW_15] I have been to this location once before with no issues. Last time I got my soon a bubble tea. The pearls (tapicoa bubbles) seemed to make him sick. I hope this place does a better job at assuring the drinks/food is fresh.",5
56,"[REVIEW_1] Paid for Deluxe Services almost 2 months prior to the event and only received a basic package at best. Attempts to resolve the issue with Keith have been returned with defensive dialogue; accusatory statements and untruths. His unprofessional approach has escalated this situation to the point of being settled in court. I have never been treated so poorly by a vendor. [REVIEW_2] Absolutely the worst meal I've had. The pizza was cold; the gyro meat looked like it was yesterday's offering; red potatoes were cold. $35 with two soft drinks. Upscale setting for awful food. Neighboring restaurants were full. Pita Jungle was empty on a Sunday night. [REVIEW_3] Unlike any experience I've ever had at a restaurant. Our waiter David was rude to our table. It started out well; we got drinks and an appetizer at happy hour. We got pretzels and daiquiris they were good but then we asked to add a person to our table and it all went down hill from there. Our waiter was a bit aggressive about this comment but eventually agreed to let us add one more person to our table. We had plenty of room and we pulled up another chair without issue. After this we ordered another round of drinks and waited for out third to arrive. My friend could not finish her drink and gave it to our third guest when he arrived. David; our waiter seemed to take great issue with this. He came to the table and scolded and wagged his finger at me for ordering a happy hour drink for a person that was not present. We were apologetic and offered to pay the full price. He rolled his eyes and warned us not to do it again. He later came back and half-heartedly apologize but it ruined the whole experience. If we go back we will be sure to request a different waiter. [REVIEW_4] You don't accept cash?  I don't think you grasp the ramifications of such a corpo-fascist economic principle.  No room for arrogant commies in my diet thank you so very very little.  Can't wait to see this place nosedive  For anyone in the dark about this policy;  watch Mike Judge's film; Idiocracy. Pay close attention throughout the hospital scene.   ""Unscannable!!!"" [REVIEW_5] This Mcdonalds has poor management. Went there once and they informed us they were out of straws. Another time The shake machine for st pattys shakes was down and they didn't know when it would be up. Went there 2 weeks later and it was still down. Went there once for take home and when we got home there was no hamburger in the buns. Just a bun with pickles; tomatoes; and lettuce. Finally I got the message that these people did not care about their customers and stop going there. [REVIEW_6] Horrible service and food. Service was terrible. The management staff seemed to congregate at the wait station and chat with the servers in an unprofessional manner. At 8:30 on a Friday night the clean up guy was dragging rug mats thru the dining area. [REVIEW_7] Very tasty calzones and salads; food is fresh and reasonably priced.  Small; but nice; tap selection. [REVIEW_8] My husband and I went here right before they were closing because we were in the neighborhood and needed some items for a recipe we were planning to make the next day.  I was super disappointed in this food outlet.  The meat section looked AWFUL; most of the meat was turning brown and the whole back of the store smelled like rotten food.  Like I said; it was around closing time; but it totally turned me off and gave me a ""gut feeling"" that I shouldn't buy anything from this store.  The layout was also a bit unorganized.  I will not be back. [REVIEW_9] I've been here many times and I always come back. Great location! The service however is touch and go. It's also noteworthy that I didn't see any African American servers or bartenders. The food is good; but not great; and I haven't seen a mouse the last couple times I've been. Enjoy! [REVIEW_10] I still haven't received a phone call or an email to try and rectify this issue. I guess I need to call the corporate office. [REVIEW_11] Friday's  Bartender must own the place;  be related to the owner;   or have pictures  of someone in charge............What an Arsehole!!!!;  How does this guy stay in business??;  the attached  bowling alley must be the answer..............avoid this place;   bowling alley is great though;  what a shame [REVIEW_12] We had the worst experience there. 15 mintues after we order our food ahe is back to see if we want fries instead of rice cuase the rice is old.... Which we said no. 30 minutes later she is back with our food. [REVIEW_13] Ribeye was cold; fries tasted burnt; service was slow; Environment is bad. Seriously I would not be back. There was also even people arguing. This is the worst restaurant I ever been 2. They even ran out of peanuts!!!! [REVIEW_14] I thought they had closed shop when I learned they were no longer at their old location. When we saw they had only moved we had to try them out in their new down town location. I don't the know owners name but he is the nicest guy. Very friendly. The food was delicious but it might have been wise for us to confirm what we thought we were ordering. Indian food is delicious but I am horrible at remembering what I ordered before. Unfortunately this review is another victim of my not being able to remember the names of what we ordered. One dish was mostly spinach (a total hit); another was some red chicken dish (perfectly cooked but looked like it was dyed red); and naan which is everyone's favorite. If you know your Indian dishes you won't be disappointed. Kids are always welcome there. Be sure to enjoy downtown while you're there. [REVIEW_15] I chose Delicious Designs based on the excellent reviews I found on Yelp and I am so very pleased with the results. Leigh Anne kept in constant contact with me about details and the end result was fabulous! Of course I had a special request...that's why I chose to do some investigating. The comments people make mean alot to me and I am very happy that she was able to make (and deliver) my special cake which was a law book with a gavel and tassle. Typically meant for a law student's graduation but we used it to celebrate an attorney's 40 year anniversary. Everyone loved it and asked who made it so a polite suggestion Leigh Anne; when you make cakes from now on; turn it in with a few of your business cards so that the host can hand out your card when people want to know who made it. Ours was white cake with fresh strawberries in a strawberry mousse filling. It was delicious! Thank you so much for all your hard work. You will be hearing from me again.",3
57,"[REVIEW_1] Swung by for the first time today for lunch. I've heard great things about this place from numerous people and it exceeded my expectations. It is an inviting restaurant upon arrival; really cool place to look around in as your waiting for a pick up or a seat. The cashier was very welcoming and asked me if it was my first visit. After yes he offered samples of anything on the menu and recommended the most popular dishes. I was informed that almost all the dishes were similar to a stew or soup served over rice. My order was the drunk chicken with a vegetarian option for only 7.50! I was very surprised with the affordability of a full plate. Since I ordered to go I received my food in a simple styrofoam clam shell container. The presentation was pretty lackluster; but food doesn't need a fancy container or complicated presentation to be delicious; that's exactly what this was! This was some of the best food I've stumbled upon in Indianapolis. The drunken chicken was so flavorful with just just a tad of spice. Vegetables were sweet and tender; for vegetarians is a terrific option. Great size portions for the price. Five stars for service and delicious food I will definitely be coming back! [REVIEW_2] The donair meat was very cheap tasting....like it came out of a can or something gross.   The place looks run down.  We won't be back.  People who think this is the best donair have lived a very sheltered life in the land of donairs!  This is probably one of my worst ones! [REVIEW_3] My husband and I ate here today. It was so good. It wasn't our original plan to stop there but the business across the street was out of oysters. ( oyster house?) So; we decided to go to Landry's. Wonderful and friendly staff. The food was amazing. The oysters we had were spot on what we wanted. It was our last stop before heading out of town. I forgot our waitresses name but she was great. Very friendly.  We also got the bananas fosters cake. For $13 it's a huge piece. And so good!  Thanks Landry's we will be back. [REVIEW_4] Just had an awesome meal at Mirko. Jenn was our server and so sweet and fun. We sat on the patio with our dog and she brought a bowl of water and was very patient with the pup :) can't wait to come back! [REVIEW_5] Love this place. My favorite is their eggplant. Will definately go back again..great place to go with a group. You will need a reservation. [REVIEW_6] They have a super friendly staff and a simple modern decor.  I enjoyed the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon exhibit on display.  I got a really young and hip vibe from this place; and the sandwiches are amazing! [REVIEW_7] I've never had Thai food. Today my daughter and I stopped in for lunch after playing at the park. I had the lunch special with moon and crab dumplings; my entree was the Indonesian peanut noodles. The food was fantastic!! Service was great; our server was very pleasant; always smiling; and checked on us just enough. I will definitely return!! [REVIEW_8] This place has a northern California vibe. Reminds me of breweries in napa. Very open large space and a good selection of craft beer. The other side is a winery which is neat as well.   I recommend trying their flight of beers to get a taste of everything. [REVIEW_9] Everything about this place makes me SOOO happy. From the staff to the food to the patio - there are a few reasons why I have been here almost as many days I've been in Nashville. Keep it up y'all! [REVIEW_10] I've been to a lot of Pho Restaurant but this is the worst one....  I've been to this restaurant 2 times....  First experience; I would like to try the new place after porkie the Korean BBQ closed.....and they over charged the bill.....The bubble drink is supposed to be $3.50 but they add an extra $3.....When I asked why they said Oh it's because we put the tapioca.....The drink itself already serve w/ the tapioca; therefore I do not understand why the extra charge is necessary.....  The second time; I gave another try......I went with 11 people and ordered their pho......I found out that the flanks were shining green.....which was clear to me that the meat quality is bad....it has FUNGI....they're ROTTEN!!!!  The worst thing was that it was not only my bowls but also others....So we asked the server NICELY if we could just changed all to the rice dishes instead and pay the extra.....but the first thing they did; flew to the kitchen and brought us the rare flank and argue that the meat was fine.....Like duhhhh one bowl is ok but it's like all 8 BOWLS WITH ROTTEN MEAT!!!!  Then the other server said; Oh I'm in charge and we couldn't change the food because it's already in the system....Excuse me; but I'm not there to eat for free and I said I'M GOING TO PAY FOR THE EXTRA CHARGES.....  We dealt with this for more than 20 minutes....just want to proof that they were right.......clearly they had no idea how to dealt with their customers....NO APOLOGIZE...NOTHING AND JUST KEPT ARGUING..... Definitely the worst dinner ever.....and WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this place at all to anybody.....I believe that you do not want to pay for rotten meat..... Better go to Viet Huong or Nam Phuong across from them....it's way better with the same price; better food quality and better service! [REVIEW_11] This place was fantastic. The pizza rolls are not similar in shape to those frozen things; they're actually made like cinnamon rolls; with pizza dough instead of pastry and sauce/fillings instead of cinnamon sugar. They're amazing.  I got one of the daily specials; which was puppy drum (fish) with a side of pasta. I wasn't a huge fan of the fish; but I think I just don't like puppy drum as much as I expected to. It was prepared fine; though. The pasta is obviously homemade and the marinara is delicious.  My boyfriend got a dish that I can't remember the name of; but it was basically pasta; shrimp; and mushrooms in a rich butter sauce. Shrimp Diane maybe? It was very good. I actually ended up eating his leftovers; and I might get that next time.   The bread is good; though very full of sesame seeds; so beware if that's not your thing. We finished with the tiramisu. The flavor was great; but the texture was too wet for my taste. Again; it's more a matter of taste than anything they did wrong. We'll definitely try the ""cherrymisu"" next time; which is tiramisu but with cherry juice in place of coffee.   The service was fantastic; the place was clean; it was easy to park.   However; my absolute favorite thing was hearing one of the cooks tell another; ""I'll be back; I'm going to go peel some shrimp."" I love a place that uses fresh seafood and does things without cutting corners.   I will 100% be returning; and I'm already thinking about what I'm going to order. [REVIEW_12] This place is FANTASTIC.  I've been here twice so far and have been taken back EARLY both times.  When walking in; I was immediately greeted and offered a drink (beer; wine; iced tea; water; etc.)  I was also welcomed by the friendliest little bulldog; named Seamus.  Kristy is a hair magician!!  She is so personable and really commited to giving her clients exactly what they want; or steering them in the direction of making them look great!  Not only did I leave with my thirst quenched; and my hair looking great -- it didn't cost me an arm and a leg!!   On my last visit; Kristy turned me platinum; and I couldn't be happier with the results.  Her blowout lasted me the rest of the week and I'm still recieving compliments on how great the color is!  I'll be sending all of my friends here. [REVIEW_13] The best! Kia is my favorite! She is very experienced and works really quickly. She tries to make it as painless as possible and she's pleasant the entire time. I've had a few other wax specialists and they were all great too; but Kia is the best. [REVIEW_14] This place is amazing. Chad is so great and talks with you to find out just what you want! I felt like he had been cutting my hair for years. Can't wait to go back! [REVIEW_15] The shrimp and grits is amazing! The grits were perfectly cooked; there were more than just the 6 shrimp you tend to see in other places; and the sauce is absolutely amazing! Creamy and fresh seafood taste! Bacon on the bottom was the perfect consistency and the French toast was just what was needed to catch the extra sauce.",13
58,[REVIEW_1] I'll keep this brief. I came in for an oil change and a half hour later they return to me letting me know they cannot service the car because the engine needs replacing. Yes; the engine. So I drove to the dealership and they changed the oil for $40. No engine replacement necessary. [REVIEW_2] A very simple and very casual Nashville staple sits across from Vanderbilt University on 21st Ave.; South. The food is phenomenally basic but completely predictable. it's the atmosphere that you are coming for and that's the five star experience. Service with a smile.  Get a bucket of reasonably priced beer and some tacos or chips and sit outside. As so much has changed in the surrounding area this place remains a true neighborhood constant. Obviously better to enjoy in the nicer weather as eating indoors just doesn't have the same appeal as the outdoor opportunity.   Heads-up-- parking  is almost nonexistent but you can try The neighborhood or simply walk or Uber from your hotel. [REVIEW_3] Went for Taco Tuesday. They were also having an event; and having just opened; I was a little worried. However; everything was great; the servers tried their hardest to make us happy.  PS: this is more Texmex style; not authentic. Keep that in mind. [REVIEW_4] Great customer service. Kyle went above and beyond to make sure we got our shirts back early (since I made the mistake of taking all my fiance ' shirts in & he had none to wear.) Kyle was professional and polite. Highly recommend this Martinizing. [REVIEW_5] Loved this place! Visiting from out of town; and met up with three girlfriends.   Margaritas were fabulous; loved the fire and ice and standard margarita.   The food was superb. We each had different entrees and shared a couple appetizers; everything was flavorful and generous portions. We each went home with leftovers.   The atmosphere and decor was perfectly done. The outside curb appeal is not quite as nice and parking is tough; but the inside is done very well.   Would definitely recommend and hope to be back on a visit. Their sister restaurant; Northside Social; could learn a thing or two from Delicia. NS was just awful. [REVIEW_6] Specialty Sazerac. Specialty moonshine! Yucca fries. Brie; garlic cloves; onions; and bread. Butternut squash ravioli with mascarpone. Streak and (crab) cake. Scallops. Seriously; the scallops! Apple and goat cheese pie. Need I say more? Ok; I will: all were mind-blowing! Best meal of my life. And live music to boot! I had an amazing night here. [REVIEW_7] Slllooowweeessttt deli counter ever! Been waiting for over 20 minutes for the Daily Special of all things. I could have caught the fish myself in this amount of time. [REVIEW_8] Stayed here with the family for six nights on a trip to the Big Easy. A beautiful and charming place to stay. The staff from the doorman to the wait staff for brunch were  friendly and helpful.  The Carousel Bar is a must.   Great location; will be going back there for sure next time we are in New Orleans. [REVIEW_9] Great service. My husband ordered a cheese and bacon burger and I got the crawfish sausage por bo both well made and great tasting. [REVIEW_10] this was so worth it.  first; what an awesome innovation - the mini-scoop sampler!  i can never decide what to get; and this time i got to choose FOUR flavors!  i got the chocolate; lavendar honey; coffee butter pecan; and the pumpkin cheesecake.  the butter pecan was in a league of its own; but closely followed by the honey.  not only were these flavorful; but all four were perfectly dense creaminess.  it's a good thing i don't leave near the place. [REVIEW_11] Petcetera always gives our cat a perfect lion cut; and the employees are always very nice. [REVIEW_12] I last reviewed this place three years ago when the host at Ru San's refused to seat my family (with small child) on a not very busy early evening.  I actually avoided the place for some time and had long wasabi laced affairs with places like Fujiyama in West Nashville.    I recently returned for a late nite bite with a boy and it was significantly mediocre to warrant an update.  Like my crumbling relationship; RuSans chokes itself on sad attempts to dress up what was always low quality.  The washed out party techno and poor lighting is like being in the expositional scene of a romantic comedy set in New York. But not in the good way. The bloated menu is utterly ridiculous and stopped impressing people in 2004. The sushi; like our attempt to still enjoy sharing a meal together; was just pathetic. 90% rice; soggy seaweed; and overloaded with a sweet sauce.  I'm breaking up with you (again) RuSans. I wish you the best but I'm afraid that the Gulch is a big sea and there are plenty of other fish. [REVIEW_13] This store was such a huge disappointment. We are new to Arizona; and I was excited to visit due to the great reviews. I went in search of kitschy SW d√©cor; and I couldn't stay long. The entire store reeked of urine. It was more than my poor nose could handle. [REVIEW_14] We just left Mr T's and found them to be seriously overpriced.  For example; a white resin lounger was $40 higher than 3 other places we googled; and another lounger was $150 higher than advertised elsewhere.  For a slice that advertises as having 30% off their prices are still very high.  Seems like they just raised their prices to lower them 30%. [REVIEW_15] great food; great view. Try the lobster mac and cheese,10
59,[REVIEW_1] One recommendation: STAY AWAY FROM THE MARGARITAS!  For $5.00; you get a small cup of artificially flavored; watered down liquid that reminds me of the restaurant cocktail mix bottles sold at Bed Bath & Beyond.  A Mexican establishment; with a bar and expansive drink selection; should always serve decent margaritas - no exceptions.  And the service was just as awful.  Our waitress didn't fill up our water glasses once in the 3 hours we were there; and for our table of 4; she repeatedly got our drinks wrong (but because it took forever to get them; it wasn't worth asking her to correct the orders).   For the same price; I can go to Bakersfield and drink freshly squeeze lime juice with premium; smooth tequila; and it comes in a substantially larger size.  So you can guess where I will be the next time I have a hankering for margs... [REVIEW_2] Wish I could give 0 stars! We went with a lot of clothes in hand and while they were going through them; we looked around the store. They lied to us and said they wouldn't take clothes that were more than 18 months out of style/trend! Jeans and T-Shirts are NEVER out of trend.  They didn't buy anything from us and they were sending everyone who came in to sell their clothes away without buying anything from anyone because they were too lazy and didn't want to do work. [REVIEW_3] Wasn't referring to sandwiches ... Was referring to gyro play with  beef rice lettuce and pita bread .... [REVIEW_4] Rude; inattentive; uneducated and they always make you feel that you are bothering them. I have started using mobile order because it's one less idiot to deal within the chain. When they start making $15 an hour we will be ordering from kiosks and maybe dealing with one person. [REVIEW_5] Horrible dining experience. Waitress was terribly slow. Messed up drink order. Had no artichoke and spinach dip; reason was it has been a busy week yet it was only Monday. Ordered the chicken club and only half the sandwich had chicken on it. When we told the waitress she shrugged her shoulders and didnt seem to really care.  Took forever for her to return and offer another drink. Took forever for the food also. Will not be returning here. [REVIEW_6] Been coming in her (on occasion) for about 12 years. Food; fair. Service; usually acceptable. Today; I came in for two beers after work. Was involved in thought; and I guess closed my eyes for a moment. A gal that I think was the manager accused me of passing out at her bar! This will be the LAST time that I come here. There are too many BETTER places nearby to put up with this. [REVIEW_7] I've been to five other juice bars in the Tampa Bay Area. This is the only one that has my business! Great quality. Ironically the prices at other juice bars are higher. This place is legit. [REVIEW_8] If you haven't been here you are either not from Tucson or you been hiding under a rock! This place has it all! Very excited to find a place for breakfast burros. Viva sucks I stop going there years ago and anything betos sucks with their water down salsas and food. You will find only the best!!! Here. Fresh food salsas and great service! Opens at 6:10 am and closes at a respectable 9pm theses guys work hard. I love your food maico. [REVIEW_9] Biggest group of Dunkin Donuts idiots I have ever come across in my life!! [REVIEW_10] Absolutely the worst meal I've had. The pizza was cold; the gyro meat looked like it was yesterday's offering; red potatoes were cold. $35 with two soft drinks. Upscale setting for awful food. Neighboring restaurants were full. Pita Jungle was empty on a Sunday night. [REVIEW_11] Tried to go there the other night but got stopped at the door for wearing boots even though I've been there a dozen times with boots on and other people were going in and out wearing boots. [REVIEW_12] We had an issue with an item missing with our takeout.  Cam saved the day by going above and beyond by delivering the missing item to us and even gave a desert for the inconvenience.  The food was delicious and we'd definitely order from them again. [REVIEW_13] I will literally never eat here because the owner/parking lot bouncer was very rude when we went to dinner on Saint Patrick's day ar Tir a Nog.. We tried to park in open parking that was sectioned off by SHORT HILLS RESTAURANT AND DELI OF CHERRY HILL NJ;  orange cones and signs (which by the way are completely illegal) and they were not respectful nice or friendly about us accidentally parking there.. They were simply jealous of the prosperous Irish pub... The man/parking lot bouncer (not sure of his name) was completely rude... Even though they closed at 9 he would not let us park there as of 8:15... We are new residents to this area and looking for new local places to enjoy BUT we will NOT EVER be enjoying this place (SHORT HILLS RESTAURANT AND DELI) since the owner(or parking lot bouncer was so rude) we will NEVER fraternize a business who stands for being rude to their neighbors and especially to their fellow business owners who pay for the parking spots just as much as they do.... Short Hills Restaurant and Deli  I'm extremely disappointed in you're neighborhood hospitality and how you treat you're neighbors!! [REVIEW_14] Great experience -- second time at Granite City Brewery. Our server Kylie was top notch - great food and drink recommendations; service. We had the the pulled pork waffle sandwich and pepper maple bacon flatbread. Worth another visit real soon! [REVIEW_15] I'm not sure why I'm writing this since you can just look at every other review written for this place and get the exact same story.   My wife was literally grabbed; like actually literally grabbed; by the face the second she stepped in the door. The culprit was a big-tittied shot girl that proceeded to dump a bunch of piss water down her throat. Then I was informed I owed her $24. When I refused to pay I was told the police were being called. My wife; not wanting to spend our trip coming to pick me up at the police station; (which is where I gladly would have gone rather than give a penny to these shady-ass MFers); swiped my wallet from my pocket and paid the bill.   Everybody there from the door guys to the managers to the bathroom attendants are the worst; most sketchy people on Bourbon Street. If you gave this place a five-star review please do humanity a favor and shoot yourself in the face.,4
60,"[REVIEW_1] Stopped by after a trade show with a coworker; the food was very good; had the crabcake as an appetizer and a very nice bone in ribeye for a main dish; needless to say I was not able to finish it; but it was delicious and the service was very good; walking distance to pretty much anywhere in downtown St. Louis; if in the area I would try it [REVIEW_2] 1. Bad service - all the waitresses were congregating by the cash register. not minding the place - food came out but we weren't asked what condiments we wanted nor were we provided any eating utensils. I guess it's a self service kinda place.  2. Bad food - old cold fries - unseasoned and overcooked burger. buns weren't even  toasted.  Don't go there for food. [REVIEW_3] First time diner and I will definitely be back.  The food was awesome.  Best fried cheese and wings I've had in a while.  Shelby was our server.  She did a great job.  I'm looking forward to coming back next week.  I can't believe on Thursday tall PBR drafts are 2.50. [REVIEW_4] I don't know why this place has 2.5 stars so far; it was really really good; we got some sort of shrimp pasta with cream sauce and it was out of this world.  The waiter made me a drink that wasn't on the menu; Caesar salad was amazing; bread yum.  Who could complain? Nice decor; never been to one before. [REVIEW_5] My fianc√© and I went to Spraga last night..needless to say it was our first and last time dining at this establishment.  We were pretty pumped to go here since we live right down the street and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at Fat Ham a few weeks ago.  The food was good but not show stopping.  My major issues were with the service.  1 word.  Unbelievable.  We spent $180 on 2 people.  When you spend that much money on a meal.. You expect perfection with food; service and ambiance.  This place underwhelmed and now I have to deal with my fianc√© who is still raging with last nights experience.  Thanks Spraga.  Issues: 1.  Soups came before cocktails.  I finally had to ask a manager where our cocktails we're because it so long.  - not in my world if I'm paying $180!   2.  First course came while we were still eating our soup..so we had 2 plates in front of us on a cramped table.  Hello serving 101 at like the most basic restaurant in the world..Don't bring the next course when people are still eating their first!  Again I would expect shit like this to happen if I were at TGI Fridays but I wasn't at TGI Fridays.  I was at SPRAGA. 4. The waiter tried to remove plates while we were still eating from them.  Say what?  Not when I'm paying $180 on a meal son!  You leave the plate until I am finished! 5.  The waiter would awkwardly come to the table and just stand there.. Obviously we know he came to take our food order or dessert order but you say "" Is everyone ready?.. I'd like to take your order"" etc.  WTF.  Nope he just stood there... Weird!   6.  Empty glasses/butter dishes left on the table throughout the meal.  Sloppy.  The server tries to take plates we are still eating from but leaves sangria glasses etc for the entire meal?  I just.  Don't.  Get it.    All in all food was good; not amazing and I've had better service at Tangier.  If you are going to spend that much money go somewhere else. [REVIEW_6] This is the most inefficient operation I've ever seen. We waited in line for over an hour and the women working the desk were very rude. [REVIEW_7] I would do 0 stars if I could! This company took full payment for a bed and never delivered it. I sent 3 emails and many phone calls and not once did I receive a reply or call back nor did I ever receive an update on my purchase. The few times when someone answered when I called I was told it was on back order and then the day it was suppose to be delivered and wasn't; I called and was told it was discontinued. My money should have been refunded that day and in my account three days later( I was assured it was being refunded that day). It never got to my account and two phone calls later found out they never refunded it but was once again assured that they would refund it that day. I am now afraid I am going to have to take legal action to get my money back. I complained to managers and write emails but it does not seem to matter. Worst company and service ever!!! [REVIEW_8] Called in a Mediterranean chicken shawarma. Good flavor and they were generous with the amount of chicken in the pita. The food was ready to go when I arrived. Good service. I would revisit the next time I am in the area. [REVIEW_9] Can't beat Costco pricing for bulk purchases. You have to use debit or cash unless you have their credit card. [REVIEW_10] Great experience!  I went in for a routine cleaning and found the facility to be very clean and modern on the inside.  The hygienist was extremely friendly and helpful; and the doctor who performed the exam was also very informative and friendly.  I was there about 20 minutes early and was taken in right away; with the entire process only taking about 15 minutes.   It was great experience; and I'll come back again! [REVIEW_11] Fantastic Mexican truck.   The guys there are very kind and polite.  The tacos are superb.  Tostado was delicious.  Veggies seem very fresh and clean.    Only outdoor seating.  Ice cold can/bottle drinks and shade. [REVIEW_12] Awful food! Don't go to this place. Jambalaya was cold; looked like a fast food!!!! We ordered a non spicy fish. It came like hell hot overloaded with hot sauce. The server simply said it was not her fault; but the chef...I thought everyone working in the same place were supposed to be one team and not one blaming the other....bad bad bad behavior.... [REVIEW_13] The ambiance and live music here is fantastic. The band was pleasant and not overbearingly loud.  However the whole ""you have to be out in 1.5 hours"" is a major turn off. I could understand if people were sitting around not ordering but if you're ordering food and drink that makes no sense.  The food was decent but nothing to write home about. The service however was terrible. Since everything is served tapas style the food comes out as it's ready. Unfortunately my tacos took so long that everyone was finished eating and I still didn't have my food.   Then I saw the table next to me (which arrived 30 min after us) served not one but two taco plates. When I asked the server what's going on; she gave me a really bitchy attitude and acted as though she was talking to a child. She goes ""yeah like I said the kitchen is backed up."" To which I said yes but not enough She did take them off the bill but her attitude was so off putting and condescending I didn't even care at that point.   The tacos still took another 15 min after that.   Also they have 2 different websites with different menus which is confusing. I went there based on one menu and got something different. Annoying. [REVIEW_14] Amazing all-around experience at Jiallo's. As soon as we walked in; we were greeted warmly. We ordered the jerk chicken and curry chicken with rice and beans and plantains and the food was all excellent. If you're looking for a new food experience; try Jiallo's! [REVIEW_15] We have driven by this place so many times looking for good sushi; but the building isn't so welcoming. We finally decided to give it a try tonight based on other yelp reviews and were very pleased we did. Everything was delicious. I think this will be our place of choice for sushi now.",9
61,"[REVIEW_1] Excellent staff and services.  They took all of the concerns and mystery out of oral surgery.  Definitely a place to get Excellent; respectful treatment. [REVIEW_2] I love Barrio. I used to live right down the street and go there pretty often; but even now that I don't I still find myself coming here with friends. Last night we went for the rehearsal dinner for a wedding; they had the other side of the restaurant open and we had the entire back space to ourselves. It was really great and the server Tina I think her name was; did a great job handling about 25 people all on her own. My beer was never empty and the food was prompt; hot and delicious. I got the pulled pork; but I usually get burgers. I drank the berry beer; tried the pumpkin seasonal beer; which I thought would be good if I hadn't have been drinking berry beer the whole night!  If you haven't been into that second area of Barrio; go there and look inside; really neat with a huge metal tree in the middle. [REVIEW_3] So disappointing.....after living in the area for many years and ate there on many occasions I decided to stop for lunch. What I discovered that it is now fast food Mexican with no regaurd to your choice of toppings! Disgusting and not worth my money or time any longer..... So many better ""quick"" eats on the westside that probably would have been better - no more visits for me!  p.s. would've asked for a refund. But in this day and age didn't want to start any drama - [REVIEW_4] I've only been to Lex one time but I had the time of my life. I've been to many nightclubs but nothing comes close to Lex. I was there for the Chainsmokers event. The manager Will did an amazing job and Set is up with a booth in the perfect location. Our waitress Alex was amazing; always making sure we were doing good. The service was on point. Which says a lot considering that this was their biggest event so far. The music was amazing. The club is the best looking club I've ever seen. Don't waste you time and money going to any club nearby; you won't find anything as epic as Lex. Trust me; you'll be amazed. I will definelty be back. [REVIEW_5] Coming from the Northwest... I've yet to find a replacement coffee shop for my faves back home... until NOW. Coffee; Lunch is AMAZING. Stopped in for the first time to grab coffee and a breakfast biscuit - phenomenal. Best biscuits I've had since I moved to the south. Since my first visit; I've been trying to make it back during business hours without luck; until today. Stopped in for the breakfast biscuit; but just missed the breakfast's over memo and was referred to the steak sandwich by the folks behind the counter - they were so acommodating of my starving fluster - I settled for the steak sandwich and I'm so glad I did; because it's one the best steak sandwich I've ever had. I'll be making regular visits to this Nashville gem of a coffee; lunch spot.   SO GOOD. Go.   Biscuits are awesome. Coffee is awesome. And people that work there - even awesomer!!! [REVIEW_6] My favorite local Mexican restaurant. The chimichangas and cheese dip are delicious! Busy on Monday nights as it is there taco night. [REVIEW_7] Great food and awesome service. There's normally a wait; but a seat at the bar is the best seat in the house; in my opinion. Awesome happy hour too! [REVIEW_8] The food was great nice character! We sta on the porch durining lunch time with a beer I really enjoyed watching the cars go by something I dont get a chance to do.....Loved IT! [REVIEW_9] Just watched the final of the World Cup here. Great food; great drinks; and good people. The Crunchy Burger and the hand cut fries are awesome. [REVIEW_10] Called in to pick up my order but when I arrived they acted as though they never spoke to me. I was told I'd have to wait an extra 10 minutes on top of the 15 minutes of previous waiting. The food was undercooked and the service staff was incredibly rude. I'll never return to this place. [REVIEW_11] Probably the worst haircut experience I've ever had. Trimmed my beard against my request and it came out very uneven. Took FOREVER. Workers were extremely inconsiderate. Definitely do not go here. [REVIEW_12] Really like this place..Food isn't always the star of the show; but doesnt mean its not good..It really is. Good selection of beer; wine list is simple and good. But sets a great vibe that you can tell makes it everyones neighborhood joint. Always a fun time. [REVIEW_13] Wow; the BBQ Shrimp was killer.  Definitely a must.  Ted and Dwayne did a great job as servers.    I would come back for sure.  The decor is nice and the atmosphere pleasant. [REVIEW_14] Love it here  The atmosphere is great the options are more than average and the lunch bento boxes are great.  If you have the opportunity always try the boba as well.  Those complaining are just picky and should go back to eating at home.    Try their beef braised soup as it is hearty and delicious. [REVIEW_15] Listen; I can even take my meat-eating parents here without a hitch; so they've gotta be doing something right. I have encountered almost zero disappointment at this place. I've been vegan for almost 10 years now; lived all over; and this is the best vegan take-out joint I've EVER been to.   My favourites are probably the Crispy HipCity Ranch ('chickn' burger); Ziggy Burger (tempeh); Jerk Caesar Salad; Green Lemonade and sweet potato fries... my Philly-native husband loves the cheesesteak.  I love salad but couldn't get into the udon and spinach salads (could have just been the service that day---few toppings on either). Definitely don't make up your mind about this place until you've tried a burger!",12
62,"[REVIEW_1] They are dirty; have very bad service; they are very distracted. They stop during your mani + pedi to help someone else for 15 min at a time. Took almost 2 hrs for me and a friend to get a mani pedi; and not because they were being attentive. Would not recommend; will not go back. Tina's Nails is awesome. [REVIEW_2] Terrible seating experience. We walked into the restaurant. Half the tables were empty (not exaggerating; I counted). The host said ""we are too busy; 35 minute wait"". We put our name down for optionality; and not 7 minutes later we were texted that our table was ready. We arrived at the restaurant and were made to wait another 10 minutes because the host was ""busy"". [REVIEW_3] I always admired the cakes in the window of this store and wanted to order my daughters birthday cake here the last few years. I was very excited when my husband agreed on the Cake Boutique to make our cake for her 5th this year. I wanted a nice five layer cake and no expense was to be spared! I cannot even begin to tell you how shocked I was at their terrible customer service. The lady showed me the different cakes and informed me on how much each one was. I told her I liked the three tier cake but might need something bigger since I specifically wanted five layers. She told me the basic starting price and let me know decorations would cost more. I was fine with that and told her I would like to get the order started. When I asked her if I could taste a few flavors she said they don't let people taste for free but I could buy some cupcakes if I wanted to. When I asked if the cupcakes in the case were all the flavors they made; she just shrugged her shoulders and said ""I think so."" So I bought a chocolate; yellow and raspberry filled cupcake. I sat at the table to taste them ( I noticed after I sat down there was a sign on the table that said ""reserved for cake tasting"" ) I then asked her if there was delivery available; since I did not want to risk driving with the cake myself and possibly ruining it. She said for an additional $50 I could get it delivered. I told her my major cross streets and she said she was going to check on something and would be right back. While she was gone I tasted the cupcakes and I could not believe how dry and bland they were. I was really shocked; the raspberry filled one was a little better tasting but not by much. I really cannot tell you what specific flavor they were because she didn't tell me. So as I waited for her I decided not to use them. I can put up with bad customer service if the product is at least amazing but after I sampled it there was no way I was going to pay $600 for a cake and get treated the way I did and have it taste horrible on top of all that. So just because they have a fancy store and nice displays- don't just assume that the service is great and the product is good. I will stick with Nadine's- they have outstanding customer service and the cakes never let me down. [REVIEW_4] Great surprise sushi place. The miso soup was the best we have ever had; the house salad was actually good. I ordered Dinner Box A which came with four different items which three were fantastic and the steak over vegtables just ok. So we ordered more food. One eel and one tuna. That was amazingly fantastic. wow. I am really liked the sound of the waterfall. [REVIEW_5] WOW! We love this place; always clean and waited on hand and foot. Love to play the slots and eat and its all great. The rooms are always the best in Reno. Thank you Peppermill love everything about you! [REVIEW_6] This was the WORST HOTEL STAY EVER!!  asked for a Non- smoking room.  Went to that room and it smelled so bad!  Asked for another room and that room smelled as well.  Not that clean; bathroom was old.  Not a place you wanna stay at.  And they charge a fortune for crap!!  I don't even want to rate this hotel.  But in order to post I have to pick.   One! [REVIEW_7] I will not return to this location. I contacted the manager in regards to a poorly made pizza I received; he replied to my online inquiry but never followed through on taking care of things. I even sent a photo to prove that the appearance of the pizza was not acceptable; and I never heard back from him. [REVIEW_8] Guy at the counter was rude; the place was filthy; and all around horrible! Would/will not recommend this place at all! [REVIEW_9] St Mary's is always my first stop when getting into Tucson. Yes sometimes the wait is a little long but always worth it. I have never had a bad dish yet. I have been coming here for the last 18yrs and will continue to return. Portions are big so there is always enough to take home for later. [REVIEW_10] Terrible terrible terrible. Out of 6 meals we ordered to go; 5 had to be thrown away. We were missing half the components that were supposed to be part of the meal (no buns for our burgers; no fries that were supposed to come with it) items which were described as vegetarian came with bacon; it was just a major fail all the way around. The few components that we did try were completely flavorless. We will never go back or order from here again. Waste of time and money as I then had to go home make make dinner. [REVIEW_11] I would give this place 0 stars if I could. We went during Sunday happy hour and I specifically asked our waitress about specials and she told me brunch was over and there were no other specials. Come to find out there was a whole happy hour menu and 2 of the beers we ordered were on happy hour but we were charged full price. The waitress was not apologetic; just annoyed when I confronted her and said ""I didn't know you wanted happy hour"". I was confused because it is the first thing I asked her whenever she finally decided to greet our table.  She also rarely came to our table to check on us. Go elsewhere; there are plenty of better places in the area to eat and drink. [REVIEW_12] What else is there to say about 3 Muses?  Creative; reasonably priced food by one of my local favorites; Chef Dan Esses; fun; laid back atmosphere; clean (not something often said about bars on Frenchmen); great music but not intrusive; really good cocktails and an eclectic ; well priced wine list.  Definitely worth checking out! [REVIEW_13] The cauliflower pizza is the BEST. We will be back again & again to get some pre made protein packs  and look around for more healthy and delish goodies. Loved the cauliflower sandwich too; Great place! [REVIEW_14] At 6:03pm; the PSTA Driver sped through the Marina; not even bothering to slow down to pickup the Passengers; which there were 9 Passengers waiting. That Driver (a White Guy; just to narrow it down) should be Fired Immediately! [REVIEW_15] I love these burgers.  The fries are pretty good; too.  Don't even get me started on the cheese steaks.  Try to go during daylight hours.  The street is a little on the rough side.  Fitting more than one baby in there who needs a high chair is pretty tough.",6
63,"[REVIEW_1] As 45 put it best...  this place is a ****hole.   To the people in charge of the entire brand Steak and Shake:  take note of how Freddy's operates. Ditch the worthless waiters who understandably are as motivated to return to the table as I am the proctologist..   it's flipping 3.99 meals and half the customers are kids. Of course you won't make crap for tips.   Put up a coke freestyle machine and have people place and order up front. I'll get my own refills and napkins. Faster mind you and with pleasure.   PS.  It's not normal to had a 4 year old a fully loaded plate of food. [REVIEW_2] The pasta was cooked perfectly; chicken parm was delicious and pizza was good. What amazes me most is in a packed place this one cashier/waitress was able to do it all seamless and well. Impressed [REVIEW_3] This is the WORST!  OVER PRICED!  3 Little scallops (COLD!!! and cut in half!!!---they were about 1/4 inch thick!) for $10!  The other apps I got were rediculously over priced!!!  The Bartender was Very Nice!  I got take out.  I got home and almost cried! After eating $30 worth of food; I was STILL HUNGRY!!!!  NEVER AGAIN!!!!! [REVIEW_4] Great food and the staff are some of the best  Best tequila selection in town Best value  My go to place for Mexican food  Thanks  Jeff in Fishers [REVIEW_5] Called in to pick up my order but when I arrived they acted as though they never spoke to me. I was told I'd have to wait an extra 10 minutes on top of the 15 minutes of previous waiting. The food was undercooked and the service staff was incredibly rude. I'll never return to this place. [REVIEW_6] This place is amazing! Finally we have a great butcher in the bywater. I've had their boudin; andouille; pork pat√®; boudin stuffed chicken; chicken stock; bone marrow; aged bone-in ribeye; Italian meatballs and it's all been 5 beans! I've given their delectables as gifts and all have been thrilled! The guys at Shank will prepare your meats for the freezer as well.  Do yourself a favor and only shop with these wizards [REVIEW_7] The Poutine and ""The Depot Burger"" are amazing here. Definitely a winner that will satiate most foodies. Additionally; the staff and ambience of this venue is awesome. Not to mention; they cater fine brews and an outdoor area with cornhole boards. I give this establishment an A+ and I will most definitely return when I have gigs in the Reno; NV area. [REVIEW_8] Waited 1 hour for a simple salad. This place takes forever to bring out your food! The service is slow and horrible.  I had to ask for my salad to go since I had a plane to catch.  When I was able to finally eat my salad; they forgot to put a side of salad dressing; needless to say my salad was awful!  There are plenty of other restaurants you can go to; don't waste your precious time and hard earned money on this dump! [REVIEW_9] Excellent pork sandwich! I got mashed potatoes and banana pudding as sides....all I can say is YUM YUM!! The potatoes were probably my favorite; real and buttery and chunky; yum!! Highly recommend if in Nashville! [REVIEW_10] Really good; really authentic! This is some of the BEST Mexican cuisine I've tasted since my nana cooked for me; I'm from California so I would know. The enchiladas w/mole are awesome and the carne asada tacos remind me of Rosarito Beach; yummy! [REVIEW_11] I went in for a manicure and I will not be coming back. I walked in and immediately wanted to leave. It was so uncomfortably hot and stuffy. As I was choosing the color the girl came up to me and asked if I was ready. Less than a minute later she comes up to me again and asks if I'm ready. So rude.  When I did sit down for the manicure; she did not take good care of me. She barely used the nippers on my cuticles or skin and filed my nails crooked. Then she left half way through my manicure to do three eyebrow waxings. As if this weren't bad enough; she got polish on my fingers and missed a sizable amount on my pinkies. I will not be returning to this establishment and I hope you will not either. Go to LyLy's across the highway. Better customer service and quality manicure! [REVIEW_12] Love the authenticity of their food. Guacamole is great to the beef tacos. Creamy Chipotle chicken taste delicious. [REVIEW_13] It was a Saturday night and market st in Philly was swarming with people. My friends and I checked 2 restaurants but they both had over an hour long waits. The wait at Anjou? Non existant. That should have been a red flag right there but we were starving and they had couscous on the menu; April's fave.  The menu wasn't cheap but the food sounded good. Marco and Karina ordered the ""Chilean Sea Bass w/ Tarot puree; heart of palm salad; atop a miso glaze [26]"". April ordered the ""Pan Seared Red Chile Norwegian Salmon; Sweet peas & couscous in a sun dried tomato; red pepper sauce [22]"" because again; she was seriously craving couscous. A fourth companion; Megan; ordered the ""Bi Bim Bap- A medley of vegetable & egg julienne; served with two traditional Korean sauces and a bowl of miso soup (available without beef) [16]."" I opted for the ""French Cut Chicken Breast; Wasabi gnocchi; wild mushrooms; & asparagus in a sweet garlic ginger sauce [22].""  All sounds delicious doesn't it? Yeah; we thought so too.  First problem. A chip in my glass that was sharp enough to cut a lip. I didn't get cut but I could have! Did I mention the plastic shard at Cheesecake?? The waitress apologized and gave me a fresh glass. Fine; no biggie.   Second problem. They ran out of gnocchi for my chicken and tried to push the mashed potatoes. Hey; I can make that at home for a dollar. No thanks. So they said they can do risotto. Fine; no biggie.  Third problem. A very; VERY long wait. For a restaurant that wasn't very busy; they sure like to take their time. Maybe they were trying to lure other unsuspecting people from the outside by pretending that they have a full happening place like the rest of them but my friends and I had no interest in being part of their marketing gimmick. We just wanted to be fed! The food had better be worth the wait....  Fourth problem. We finally received our entrees and I immediately recognized a problem. April; the poor innocent patron who had ordered the salmon because of the couscous received; before her; a plate looking very barren with a piece of salmon the size and shape of a sleeve of laffy taffys; 6 or 7 halves of asparagus; and NO COUSCOUS. BIG BIGGIE.  ""Where's her couscous?!"" I blurted out. That's when we noticed that nearly all our dishes were missing crucial elements from the menu.   The chilean sea bass was NOT served with mashed taro and hearts of palm salad. just a ring of MASHED POTATOES. Maybe I should have asked what ""french cut"" meant because now I know that it means ""slice a chicken breast as thin and flat as possible to try to cover the plate and keep down costs."" My wild mushrooms must've gone loco because they were nowhere on my plate. Maybe they were partying it up with my asparagus because they were also m.i.a. My risotto? Oh it was there all right; resting on my plate like a pale; sticky dome of something that resembled MASHED POTATOES! Since when is it okay to be able to scoop risotto with an ice cream scooper??   We were not happy campers. We went on a hunger strike. The host went back to the kitchen to find out what happened. He came back and informed us that ""they ran out of the couscous; and the mashed taro"" AND the gnocchi??? And the wild mushrooms??? What do you have back there; a 50 lb bag of instant MASHED POTATOES???   The rest is blur. I remember telling the host/waiter/customer service you can't just change an order without asking the patron if it's fine with them. He agreed and took care of the drinks that we had ordered. That much they did right. We still left a tip for the waitress because we felt horrible that she has to tell family and friends that she works there.   We left. Still hungry and livid. The waitress was outside crying and smoking a cigarette. Poor girl; I hope she moves on to a decent establishment like Hooters or Fudruckkers. I wish her well.  The 5 of us went down the street to Soho Pizza and scarfed scrumptious slices for 2.50 a piece. And when I ordered the mushroom and broccoli pizza; both mushrooms AND broccoli appeared on my slice. See; other people can do it; why can't Anjou?   Unless you want mashed potatoes; don't go here.   EDIT 1/19/10-  It has come to my attention that this dreadful place is now CLOSED. VICTORY!!!! [REVIEW_14] Always the sweetest ladies! Appointments never take forever and barely any wait time! [REVIEW_15] We came here few times as we live at the corner. We loved our previous orders but not the one we made last week. At first it was a little burn; not a big deal; I won't eat the part where it's burn; but after a bite; I noticed something wrong.   We ordered the same than usual and this time I didn't get why I was expected. I didn't get a tomato sauce base as I had on my last orders. It was very frustrating. We went back to explain there was a mistake on our order as there is no tomato sauce so we wanted our order to be right.   They were very rude about it and refused to make another one saying that what I ordered doesn't have any tomato sauce! What a surprise because I ordered it a couple of month ago and I got it with tomato sauce. We were obviously bothering them on a quiet night.  Of course; what I ate was super dry without the tomato sauce and the burning!!! I won't go back here anymore! It's a shame how they talked to us. Terrible customer service and rude people.",8
64,"[REVIEW_1] I kind of bumped into this place while driving; and I'm so happy I did! It's pretty small and cozy on the inside; but features cute and authentic decor. The server was very sweet and helpful; even suggested items to try. I ordered the quarter chicken; and two sides. It was a great value at $7.50 and a HUGE portion;enough to make two meals out of. I got salad and cilantro rice as my two side choices. The cilantro rice was amazing and full of flavor. The dressing was sweet and made in-house; so the texture was just right. The meal came with a green sauce for dipping; which was a little spicy; and a yellow Peruvian sauce. The yellow sauce was so good; and pretty much made the whole meal. I will definitely be back; possibly for lunch; since the menu offers sandwiches as well. Only downfall? I wish the place stayed open a little later than 8pm; for those of us that like to have late dinners. [REVIEW_2] Not exactly sure why this service calls itself Reno-Tahoe Shuttle when it does not service Reno...just tried to book a ride from the RENO-TAHOE AIRPORT and apparently this is out of their pick up area. Very confused.  And if you can't help me; maybe you can direct me to someone who CAN. [REVIEW_3] Great food. Definitely will continue to go there. Actually about to order from there today. Grilled cheesesteak was great but my Gf had the steak and shrimp quesadilla that was huge and real good. [REVIEW_4] Think twice before renting from Event Rental -- they regularly and knowingly overcharge their customers. Make sure you know exactly what services are being performed; and pay close attention to your bill. Their business policy and practice is to fraudulently charge customers for work not performed whenever there are back to back events.  Long story relatively short: tents were rented three days in a row at a venue for three separate parties (one day for each party). Mine was the middle day (Saturday). I was charged almost $250 (a third of my total cost; which they make you pay upfront) for delivery and ""after-hours"" pickup (labor fees) for my Saturday event at a venue; even though I realized about a week after my event that the same tents were standing on both the day before (Friday day and through the night) and the day after (the tents stayed standing through Saturday night and through Sunday morning). So basically; they set up the tents on Friday; left them up through the weekend until sometime on Sunday; and then charged each of the three parties separately for the full cost of delivery/pickup labor. After many attempts to call and speak to a manager and never receiving a call back; I was told there was nothing they could do about it -- one employee even stated explicitly that it is the company's standard procedure to charge each separate client for the full price of delivery and pickup; even if only one delivery and one pickup each are performed for a weekend consisting of three different events. So after many days of no return calls and no communication from upper management or any admission of wrongdoing; I had to file a claim with my credit card company.  It's clearly a dishonest way of conducting business (""scam"" is the correct word); and when I confronted them about it in a respectful manner; they refused to admit any wrongdoing and ignored the issue until I got the credit card company involved. [REVIEW_5] Had a great experience with Advanced Towing & Recovery. I did not have the easiest task for them and we had to work out the details via phone because I am in FL.  They were very knowledgeable and helpful. They went above and beyond to make sure my daughter's vehicle was taken care of. [REVIEW_6] You need a Cinnamon Roll from the bake house.  You probably need two; life would have just a little less happiness and light without their Cinnamon Rolls. The coffee and salads are also excellent; a lovely Saturday morning breakfast treat. [REVIEW_7] 1. Ambiance-- ehh; it's nice to sit by the fountains; but you have a busy road at your back; so the illusion isn't that great.  2. Rude and unfriendly staff. Every time I go; I feel like they are doing me a favor by serving me or making my coffee. 3. For a plae that boasts itself family-friendly; they sure don't seem to like kids.  4. Pretentious for nothing. It's just not as fancy as they pretend to be.  5. Food is mediocre. Coffees don't taste like coffee. The young girls who work there aren't good baristas. Desserts are lousy. I have never had anything that tastes indulgent. They try to copy the style of the French bakeries in the area and even Whole Foods; but the taste falls flat. They tout their Triple Berry cake as the greatest dessert in town. I'd rather buy Whole Food's berry chantilly cake. At least it's fresh from there. [REVIEW_8] This nightclub is complete let down. The music was a train wreck. The dj would play a good song for 10 seconds then mix to another song that was completely off the wall like a train wreck. I would go to dance floor to start dancing and by the time I made it the song was changed.  I was in the club Fri and Sat night and dj played same mix. The dj acted like. he was mixing but never had his headphones on. Hey mister dj u suck learn to dj better. Here is a tip play music longer and don't change songs . Ur selection of music is good but u mixed into dumb ass off the wall. Like u would play snoopdogg for 10secs then mix to billie jean I'm not Ur lover by mj then to 50 cent  all three songs in less than a minute.   The dj ruined the club. The bartenders were great. Made drinks strong and service was quick. If it wasn't for them I would have left in a heartbeat.  There is only one bathroom. That. Sucks  there is 2 port a potties in back in the dark. At 1030 the guys bathroom had throw up all over the walls and the hallway by bar stink like death. I mentioned it to many employees and they said I'm not maintenance and didn't seem to care. My visit to tonic nightclub was a complete letdown and was a shity experience. Overated nightclub. [REVIEW_9] I've been reading the bad reviews on this page; and they make me wonder if the reviewers have been to the same location I was at. I found the place spotlessly clean; and everyone was friendly to a fault. I'd like to give a special shout-out to Maisha (probably spelling that wrong); who was on duty at about 6:30 PM on Friday; October 16; 2015. She treated me and every other customer like we were her best friends - making sure everyone had everything they needed. Great experience! [REVIEW_10] We are very pleased with Penn Fertility.  We interviewed several fertility clinics and ultimately chose Penn and could not be happier that we did.  We are a same-sex couple that needed an egg donor and surrogate.  The third-party coordinator was amazing at helping us coordinate all of the moving pieces for our surrogacy journey; even when there were some kinks thrown in unexpectedly.  Dr. G was also a gem when helping us work through some less than typical situations that arose.  She made herself very available throughout the processes as we needed her.  That was incredibly appreciated during what is a very emotional process.  We ultimately had a successful pregnancy on the first try and had a baby within a year of our first visit to the clinic.  We cannot be happier and are over the moon with our little bundle of joy.  We plan on using Penn again to make him a big brother soon. [REVIEW_11] Not my first time there tonight but absolutely my last.  I am beyond sick to my stomach (literally) as I type this and so are my 3 friends that went there with me tonight. Eat here at your own risk; we had a friend in from out of state and it ruined our night. [REVIEW_12] Cashier was very rude fat Hispanic girl at the airport location. Very very rude. Half the menu wasn't even available. [REVIEW_13] Never had Malaysian food before eating here; but it's extremely good.  Roti canai was an excellent appetizer; almost better than the breads at dedicated Indian restaurants.  The noodle dishes are also delicious.  Atmosphere was great; I'll be back soon. [REVIEW_14] THIS place right here is a good reason to move to Tucson with your classic car. I flew in for a quick visit to check out a '65 Mustang yesterday and these guys were so incredibly accommodating; I was blown away.   They bent over backwards to obtain all the information they could about my potential purchase and even got a Mustang appraiser on the phone to consult with me on a purchase price. They were thorough and took their time as opposed to rushing me through and just phoning it in; and it cost a whopping $98.   I highly recommend these guys. They are experts and know classic cars; and from the inventory - new cars as well; like the back of their hands.  Thanks Guys! [REVIEW_15] Awesome! Great place. The staff are friendly and met all our needs. Very great energy. Each shake is handmade to perfection like a work of art. If you are diabetic this is a no no for you. It was soooo good! The owner even came out and spoke with customers. She has such a beautiful spirit! So happy we stopped by! We couldn't even eat it all. My recommendation is to share.",9
65,"[REVIEW_1] Went here with some coworkers and were awkwardly informed that we couldn't split the check beyond 3 checks. Also; when asked when lunch ends; the waiter couldn't even say a time; just that it had ended.   The waiter made 6 people write down their orders on a blank piece of paper. When he would bring us a beverage or plate; he would only acknowledge one person at a time- take an order; process; return.  Never did he address the table as a group to ask if we had any more requests.   At the end; I took it upon myself to split the check based on each persons order to determine how much we individually owed. After 10 min; the waiter impatiently said that he can now split it up into different checks. I had just finished and asked him to charge each card based on my calculations; even going so far as to writing down the last 4 digits of each card to be associated win each amount. He returned with individual receipts that were wrong. Each person was charged the wrong amount; and when added up; was different than the original total!  Terrible customer service! [REVIEW_2] I don't usually give 5 star reviews; but this one is well deserved. I've been coming to Audrey for years and she is hands down the best. Cut; color; style. The best. Like impeccable. She just knows what to do and gets it right every time. I live in Santa Monica and have been to many hair dressers in LA; but no one compares to her. Anyway; just drove to SB to ""get my hair did"" and am SO happy!!! Just had a baby six weeks ago and needed to feel fresh and young again. Now I do :) I love you Audrey!! [REVIEW_3] I've been to lots of Asian restaurants. This is definitely my favorite! Everything is very authentic and obviously home-made. I just always want to go there for lunch or dinner! [REVIEW_4] Went for restaurant week  on 1/19/18; very good food and great staff. Everything we tried was great. Only negative is the espresso machine was broke.  No big deal though. [REVIEW_5] Great service & nice; large rooms. Everyone was helpful; good for large groups & corporate groups with events - but; construction during the day (new restaurant opening February 2015; week after our stay) and only 1 of 2 elevators worked. [REVIEW_6] Great food but the service is so bad we seen our waitress once  everyone else did here job plus I was not finished eating and she gave me the check    Hate that   But good food [REVIEW_7] Wow!  We had the most amazing food and service at Blue Fig!  The food is all freshly made.  We had the hummus and home made chips to start...highly recommend!!! They have a variety of gluten and dairy free options that are delicious. The falafel salad was the best.        Great to find a restaurant close by that's both healthy and affordable. [REVIEW_8] Went here last night. Giving it a 5because our waiter Colton was superb. Everyone from the hostess to the guy that seated us was very nice. The food is still very good. Great job 5 Star!! [REVIEW_9] My office building is right off of 20th and Market so this is the perfect lunch spot for me.  Like others before me have stated; the wait can be long; but I usually get around that by opting for a later lunch on days that I choose to eat from the Falafel truck. 1:00 is usually perfect.   Some people are offended by Konstadinos' rules; but really; I appreciate them. The fact that there isn't a menu is exciting! I like not knowing exactly what I'm going to get... but maybe I'm more adventurous than some people. Really; though; it's not even like he switches things up that much... He just tweaks the details a bit. The chicken is always on the platter; there is always falafel; and there is always hummus. The dessert salad and the chickpea salad/rice/whatever is all that really changes.  And I also appreciate that he doesn't let you hold a spot for someone or order more than one platter. He realizes that most of his clientele are working folks that are on tight schedules.   If you're lucky; you might catch him on a good day and he'll throw in a free drink. It's only happened to me once or twice; but still; a nice little perk. And if it happens to be cold out/rainy out; he sometimes offers soup while you wait!   As far as comparing him to Mama's; I do enjoy Mama's; but the Falafel truck takes the cake in my opinion.  It's $10 well spent; especially since I usually get two meals out of it. Just be prepared for some serious lingering garlic breath! [REVIEW_10] What a great little small business.  They got me in quickly; the garage was warm and inviting.  The decor was modern and fun.  Flat panel TV; couch; coffee; and an orange wall (Not to mention a sweet dog that says hello).   The staff was very nice and they fixed my one window in about 20 minutes top.  We will definitely use them in the future.  Won't be disappointed. [REVIEW_11] Love nails is the best nail salon and spa in Tampa. Ive been going there for over 10 years now and I haven't once had a bad experience.  Every employee and Vicki; the owner; are super friendly and hospitable. It is always a great experience! [REVIEW_12] Fun and festive! Visited twice; once on a Friday and the next time on a Saturday and both times i was treated to a super enjoyable fun night! I enjoyed the vegetarian feast both nights and the feast was a little different on each occasion. The setting was beautiful and comfy; with morrocan lighting and comfy couches. After traditional hand washing; i indulged in seven delicious courses and several fruity cocktails. Music started and the belly dancer entertained while my party moved on to hookah! Truly a fantastic night! [REVIEW_13] Visited during Chowdown Midtown and wow! was this a great choice! Very chic; modern and hip style and vibe. Almost feels like it belongs downtown it's so nice tucked in here. Food was delicia! We had the guacamole; queso; salsa trio and chips for an appetizer - all were very good. Trad margarita was really tasty. Entrees were the corn cakes (heavenly!) and the chicken mole (didn't like too much!) Dessert is yummy too. [REVIEW_14] I go once a month for a women's haircut with Keri and; because Andre Richard is in my neighborhood; I usually schedule my appointments for weekday evenings. There is a nice sense of community at this salon. The atmosphere is always fun and inviting; with coffee or tea at the ready and many of the stylists singing along to the latest pop songs on the stereo. The salon is queer-friendly; and Keri does a wonderful job giving volume and style to short; thin hair. She is especially generous with tips on how to style my hair at home; offering blow-drying techniques and suggestions of inexpensive styling products available at CVS or Walgreens. My girlfriend received a great haircut there as well; and she has long; thick hair that falls in loose curls. I always feel welcome at Andre Richard and I leave feeling like my hair has been treated with care and attention. Plus; the salon sometimes offers specials on certain nights of the week (Thursday appointments are currently 20% during the month of February!). [REVIEW_15] I've been coming to Linda at Venus experience for two years now and I hate going anywhere else. She is so thorough and quick that I forget I'm getting a Brazilian. Cheap efficient and relatively painless go Linda!",14
66,"[REVIEW_1] Let me tell you mina's is the place i always go to! The food is always good and the delievery is so quick! I am defiantly going to miss this place when i leave [REVIEW_2] This store is TERRIBLE.  I will only run in for one or two things if I absolutely have to.  I love WalMart but this one - no matter when you go (I've even been at 5am) you will wait FOREVER and 9 out of 10 times the clerk won't talk to you... at all.  I've gotten a significant amount of items that were out dated; however they do have good prices overall and there is good parking. Oh -the ATM NEVER works too. [REVIEW_3] 10/23/2015 at 7:45am Friday TICKET NUMBER 624  One white guy making sandwiches alone. There are two other black female team members was standing around talking about how they got paid today. Not doing a damm thing while he takes all the tickets. The shorter one of the two get's my ticket and mumbles my number and then takes on other orders that have been backing up. They ran out of saut√© onions so for 10 mins I stand there watching others after me get their order. She did a piss poor job of correcting the issue. She needs to be retrained on the rule of FIRST IN FIRST OUT. Help out team members on a BUSY FRIDAY MORNING. I will no longer place corporate orders for ANY of our events here at the University because of this incident. She made no effort to correct the problem or respect my busy time. WHY WAS ONE MAN DOING ALL THE TICKETS ON A FRIDAY MORNING! I was lucky enough to have her pick up me as the first ticket to be skipped. I will skip this WAWA from now on. [REVIEW_4] Ive eaten there twice and both times it was terrible. Steak was salty; fish dry; my salad was frozen ; service awful. . Im really not sure how this place gets any good reviews. [REVIEW_5] I really enjoy the service here. I've been coming here for almost my entire life and the food never ceases to amaze me! [REVIEW_6] Wish I could give 0 stars! We went with a lot of clothes in hand and while they were going through them; we looked around the store. They lied to us and said they wouldn't take clothes that were more than 18 months out of style/trend! Jeans and T-Shirts are NEVER out of trend.  They didn't buy anything from us and they were sending everyone who came in to sell their clothes away without buying anything from anyone because they were too lazy and didn't want to do work. [REVIEW_7] I went here with a group of friends and we had the buffet lunch for $9 a person and it was amazing. I loved everything about my meal! Great atmosphere; great music and of course yummy food. [REVIEW_8] NO WAY I know others like this place ;I'm sorry to say it was awful. The soup was ok; not filled up; looked like they didn't want to splurge with filling up to look decent.  the salad looked like they opened a bag of salad  dribbled it on then grabbed some off.  the garlic bread is full of jared garlic and oil  will make your stomach sick. my son ordered lasagna ; who knows what was in it  and i ordered pasta w/ broccoli it tasted like it was sitting in salt water and that was only flavor. when they found out i didn't like it the owner or someone; picked up my plate and with his fingers grabbed the spaghetti  and put it in his mouth ; need I say more how disgusting . Over priced and was awful. [REVIEW_9] Best Greek Salad I have had outside of Greece!!! Always my go to place when I am in town!  Great service and great food!! [REVIEW_10] Food was tasteless and bland. Biscuits and gravy were the worst ever. Maybe it was an off day for the cook but a little seasoning goes a long way. Food was fresh and hot but that was the only good thing about it. Average at best. [REVIEW_11] It had been many years since I last visited the Eiteljorg; and I found my way back to visit the Grand Canyon exhibit during summer 2016 - phenomenal! Like others have commented; it is a smaller museum but there are quite a lot of paintings and artifacts surrounding Native American culture.   While here; I had the opportunity to hear an hour-long lecture from Dr. Dwight Pitcaithley; former chief historian with the National Park Service. He presented about the history of the NPS; the ""sleeper"" programs we don't hear about and the future of NPS. Very eye-opening; engaging and informative. Did you know there are 412 national parks?!  I really appreciate the role Eiteljorg plays in our community and beyond - showcasing artifacts and programs that educate visitors about Western art and culture; American Indiana heritage and more. Bonus that they have a beautiful outdoor space under the sails with outdoor music; a place to dine al fresco and direct connection to the beautiful Canal Walk.  Save $: Show your AAA card for $2 off admission; or print off a coupon from Visit Indy for the same $2 off offer. [REVIEW_12] Worst service ever.  Won't be back.  Cooked sushi was over cooked and dry.  Waiter took our order and never put it in.  Sat for 20 min. Before we could get his attention and ask. [REVIEW_13] Wanted to try this place for the first time. We pick up a menu to order later. A few hours later we called for delivery. After placing our order we wanted to pay with a debit card. They told us they only take cards in the store. Delivery is cash only!!  I canceled the order and call gin house. [REVIEW_14] I had buyers remorse buying from them as soon as I was ready to drive off the lot.  The car was considered Honda Certified.  It was a 2013. That basically meant they had thoroughly inspected the car.  When I test drove the car I did not notice the small crack in the window and scratches on the passenger side.  Their inspection said no cracks; chips etc.  That was my first clue I had made a mistake.  After I arrived home I looked at the financing.  I was charged a fee to get a better interest rate. The finance person also convinced me to get a protection package I had already told the sales person I did not want.  He had already put the package into the price on the paperwork.  The car had a Sonic price of 16900.  I put 6 thousand down and still owed over 16;000 on the car at 5 % interest for 72 months.  I could have bought a new car for that price.  Beware once you go to the finance department; they will try to get you!  Go to CARMAX; you have 5 days to return the car!!!! [REVIEW_15] As far as I'm concerned; San Antonio Taco IS the 21st/Vandy area. The cheese is legendary; the food comes fast; and the place is always abuzz with students and locals. It's a restaurant that comes to feel like home -- waiting customers sign their names on the walls; the chefs know you by your order; and the finches outside sit like dogs waiting for leftovers. The food isn't that cheap; but it's the most filling fare in the neighborhood. The tortillas are so fresh you can watch them rise in the oven. And; oh my god; the cheese.",6
67,"[REVIEW_1] Reno- we have Korean!!! Finally.    While the menu is limited; it is all deliciously craveable and I can get the BiBimBap I've craved all these years.  I like to take it home and add a fried egg.  Hoping these guys will have fried eggs at some point :) [REVIEW_2] Love this place! Great food; and the owner will help you pick something if you are not sure what to order. Try the king fisher beer. Save room for desert! Great change of pace from regular boring food [REVIEW_3] This place has an awesome ambiance and great wine! It was the perfect place to come for my bday! [REVIEW_4] Great food... Love the Fish tacos & Nachos are great  it's really a nice atmosphere for family settings and night or dates too.. Music beach bar; home made ice cream  & a little play ground - it's great [REVIEW_5] OMG....passing through the mall; the girl offered me a sample.  It was moist; sweet with a hint of coffee.  That little teaser was enough for me to try it!  I bought the original and the almond.  Needless to say the original didn't have a chance to come home with me. I ate it on my 7 mile drive home. I can't wait till the morning to have my other bun for breakfast with my coffee....I can NOT wait :)  it wasn't greasy. It was fluffy; airy and delish. [REVIEW_6] Amazing. We had; Steak Tartare; Caribbean Seafood Pepper Pot and the Curried Goat. Everything was really wonderful. Tartare maybe the best i've had. The goat with the sweet curry and gnocchi was very different and I loved it. I had a bite of the lime cheesecake and it was top notch; too.   No drinks; because it's 2 days after Mardi Gras and I'm still in recovery mode. The service was among the best I've had in this town; which is know for it's hospitality industry. Great great great! [REVIEW_7] Great bar off the lobby of the International Hotel in the CBD; a block off Canal St. We met a friend for drinks and we all had a variant of a Kir Royale made with Cava and a raspberry liqueur from St. George's Spirits in Alameda that was gorgeous. Service was friendly and prompt; and we enjoyed ourselves so much that we went back the next night to do it all over again. [REVIEW_8] Down the street from our Airbnb in treme. I only ran in for coffee but they had a great patio that I would have loved to hand out on for a bit if I had time. [REVIEW_9] Great company!!!  I called and they were able to come out same day to change 4 locks at our house.  They were professional; fast and very accomodating.  I had an issue with one of the lock alignments and they immediately sanded it down and fixed it. Overall great experience and highly recommend! [REVIEW_10] This was legit and lives up to the hype. My friends and I shared the Thai sensation (Thai iced tea and lychee) which was perfect. The Thai ice tea ice cream wasn't too sweet and lychee fruit was used so the mix of the small bits into the ice cream worked out well.  3 toppings with a syrup is included for 7 dollars with tax. For the novelty and show while they prepare your treat; I think the price is very reasonable. The toppings I got were mochi; strawberry; pocky sticks and condensed milk. I think the picture will speak for itself.   They opened 2 months ago and they will have no trouble attracting attention. As a tourist to the area; I was glad to stumble upon this location. Great spot to hang out; bring a date or just get some solid ice cream.   Important to mention; this ice cream will not be creamy. Common sense; how can something that is prepared and rolled in this manner be creamy like say gelato. If you come in with a realistic expectation; you'll have a better experience. This won't be the best ice cream you'll ever have; but the appearance and novelty makes it worth trying. [REVIEW_11] Super Sunday Brunch   Such a great place for Sunday brunch. Split the cinnamon roll to start. So light and airy.   The Biscuits and Debris is a great Cajun twist on Eggs Benedict. The corn bread biscuits are deliciously addictive. The corn beef hash is unexpected light. Served with the perfect balance of sweet potato; braised cabbage and pickled green beans; it is the perfect breakfast bite.   Make a reservation. You won't be disappointed. [REVIEW_12] Venus nail is great. I was looking for a new salon and googled some in my area. I've been 3 times now and they've been amazing. Great atmosphere and service. Ask for Ivy she's fantastic. I told her I was going on a trip for my bday and to come up with something. I walked out with this and loved it all. [REVIEW_13] I went to the Screamery today with my daughter and her boyfriend; and I was pleased to hear that they are looking at a second location closer to me.  The service was excellent.  We were immediately asked if we had ever been there; and when we said no; we were given the run down on how the ice cream is made; and invited to try as many flavors as we wanted.  The owner also had a conversation with us telling us where the grass fed milk was from; and their overall story.  I also found out that you can get the ""game day"" ice cream at Sentential Peak Brewery; which is closer to me as well.  The ice cream was rich and decadent.  I had the sweet cream honeycomb; and the mudd pie.  Both amazing!!  The kind that I want to be alone with and savor every bit -  don't talk to me while I eat this!  MMM!!  And it's actually good for you!! [REVIEW_14] Always awesome!  Best crust ever and super Fresh ingredients and nice staff.  Lots of yummy toppings that aren't offered at other pizza places.   Great salads too! Patio area is a cool place to kick back;have a beer or glass of wine and savor the best pizza in town. [REVIEW_15] Mac's is my favorite bar in Old City thus far. The place is nice without being too stuffy; has a great draft selection; and runs specials during games. They have a good social media presence; which I appreciate - it's the only place I've been able to find Oberon in Philly; and I discovered they carried it via Twitter. (Not going to lie; I was thinking 4 stars until I remembered their awesome rotating drafts.) The staff is great and although I've been in too late to personally want food; the food I've seen served looks and smells great. If you're looking for a great laid back bar in the area; this is it.",15
68,"[REVIEW_1] This is the worst bar experience I've ever had. I'll try to be brief. The three beers I tried to order last night were Sierra Nevada; Sweetwater 420; and Sam Adams Boston Lager. I drink these beers regularly draft and bottle and I am very familiar with them.   I ordered a Sierra Nevada and it came out flat and warm. My friend ordered a Yazoo Pale Ale and received a cloudy; orange colored; spicy smelling blue moon.   We sent them back and ordered Sweetwater 420 instead. They where also flat and warm.  The manager said their must be a problem with the draft system and offered us bottled beer instead. I ordered my standard choice of Sam Adams figuring it was a safe bet.  He returned  with a brown bottle with NO LABEL and quickly put it on the table without saying anything or apologizing and walked away. When I took a sip it was one of the same flat warm beers that came out of the draft; I couldn't quite identify it; but it wasn't Sam Adams. I realized that they had filled an empty bottle with Sam Adams. When I realized this bottle probably came out of the recycling I stood up an left. I'm still deciding if I'm going to call the Nashville Health Department on Monday.    I understand mistakes happen; and so I was polite and patient with them. In return; I've never been more disrespected by any restaurant or bar. Any other place would have thanked me for pointing out the issue and taken care of it. [REVIEW_2] Favorite Thai in the neighborhood! Great for takeout with excellent and diverse offerings. Love ending the meal with the peanut pancake; so glad to have found this spot and the curries are rich and thick (green is my favorite) filled with more types of veggies than one usually finds. Heads and shoulders above any of the Asian spots on the South St corridor. [REVIEW_3] The donair meat was very cheap tasting....like it came out of a can or something gross.   The place looks run down.  We won't be back.  People who think this is the best donair have lived a very sheltered life in the land of donairs!  This is probably one of my worst ones! [REVIEW_4] I actually drive 2.5 hours from Cedar Key FL to get my nails done at Love Nails! Cici is worth the drive and is the only person who touches my nails! She's amazing! Definitely ask for her! [REVIEW_5] You'll definitely have a wait for brunch but grab a drink and buckle in cause it's worth it. Everyone at the table loved what they ordered. We started with the buffalo cauliflower and got the pretzel pancakes; nooner; blueberry waffle and the red velvet waffle and damn if we didn't clean our plates. Also if you don't get the white trash hash you'll regret it for years to come. Service was great and our drinks were perfect. [REVIEW_6] Can't really recommend Jack Flash Electric. I called them a month ago to make an appointment to get a live wire terminated in my house. It took them almost a week to return my call. The receptionist said she'd need to call me back to make an appointment and they just never contacted me again. I can't do weekend appointments; so I understand that there needed to be some wiggle room with their schedule. But they should have at least contacted me to tell me they couldn't do the work. [REVIEW_7] I'm all for a dive bar but this place takes it to another level. The walls are old wood panel; the whole place smells disgusting; the drinks are tiny...I don't feel any need to ever go there again. [REVIEW_8] Cannot vouch for the doctor; as the receptionist was so breathtakingly rude that I didn't even schedule an appointment. They might want to rethink their desk staff if they want to appear welcoming and friendly. [REVIEW_9] Had the worst experience I've had at a restaurant in a while here. Ordered take out and waited over an hour and fifteen minutes for our food which was just a breakfast sandwich and grit plate. In that time; only one employee came to talk to us; not to tell us sorry for the wait; but to tell us that they didn't have enough grits to complete our order.  The food is good; but not good enough to wait over an hour for. [REVIEW_10] Customers beware! If there was a way to give this business zero stars- that is how I would rate it. There is a huge banner on this location that says it is under new management because of the horrible reputation that it has. To say that they ripped me off would be an understatement. I took my Ford diesel truck in because it was close by when my engine started smoking. Biggest mistake of my life. They kept my truck for over a month- sold me used parts and charged me as if they were new parts. Charged my bank card unauthorized charges and to top it off; after paying over $7;800.00 my truck still wasn't working. I finally took it to the Ford dealer where they documented everything that was wrong with my truck and even confirmed that the wrong type of USED turbo was put on my truck. The manager Ray at the time was also just on channel 13 news because he was arrested for doing this to other customers. Seems like Midas transferred him to another location after too many complaints. I will be contacting a lawyer and the District Attorneys office.   I should also mention that during this process Ray hired me to do Landscaping upgrades to the business and I never received payment. This is not a place that you can trust. [REVIEW_11] I live in the neighborhood and used to order at least once a week and pick up.  The last last few times I have had to wait from 10 to 15 minutes as the team scrambles around trying to find change. All I wanted to do is pay for my food and take it home.   And tonight after the wait for change. I gave them 2 20's for a 27 dollar check.  I get home and it is the wrong food. My warm dish was cold and my sushi was wrong.  Lost me as a customer [REVIEW_12] You're better off waiting on the restaurant next door [even if the wait is 3-4 hours]. Our appetizer had a dead fly in it and we were told by a manager we would get 10% off... thanks to our waiter [Alvin; who was the only decent part of our visit] it was eventually removed. We then received our meal and the jambalaya [which tasted straight out of a box] had hair present. The person receiving the jambalaya is bald so it had to have come from the kitchen. This wasn't surprising as most of the staff spent 80% of their time outside smoking and laughing[with their aprons on]. The catfish plate didn't come with catfish; there was some other cheaper fish present...the seafood fettuccine only had shrimp and Alfredo sauce out of the jar in it; I had to ask and wait for crawfish. We didn't ever receive part of our meal but it came on the check. When we complained and asked to speak to the manager; he was short and unaccomodating. He never once apologized for the uncleanliness and disorganization. This was the worst experience I've ever had in New Orleans and every aspect but our waiter. [REVIEW_13] Food and music were both fabulous. Our large group ordered a wide variety of dishes and we were very happy with all of them. [REVIEW_14] In my experience; the staff was a disappointment. We had 3 employees try to take our ""complicated"" order. We just wanted baked salmon with Avocado and cucumber. Which was just a simple customized order. While we were ordering our waitress didn't have the power to take our order. She felt it was to complicated so she just walked away and pass us up to another waitress. In result this restaurant lacks communication and mannerisms. So I wouldn't recommend this place. If your order is to complicated to them; they won't take it. they'll just pass you up to their manager. [REVIEW_15] I called to get a price on getting a flat fixed $35.99WTH! Is this price legal... Smdh in a city where they don't EVEN pay livable wages.... #tragic ..smdh",4
69,"[REVIEW_1] Came down from Jersey after seeing the Dan Band perform; which was phenomenal! We got the urge to order a hookah with a liquor option. Walked over to Fez.. no one attended us at first so we sat down at the couch area. The place was dead for 10pm Friday.   The attendant came and said let me seat you someplace else. I asked to keep the seat I was already at. He said we couldn't; so I told him to speak to whomever to get the approval. The guy came out and ask what's the problem. I said hey boss; your place is dead and we'd like to sit at the large couch area. He said they can't because that's for parties of 8. I said I understand; but there was no one in your store and if that big party ever came; we would move. Their answer: no we can't.   I said no problem; packed my things and was ready to walk out. The guy asked are you really leaving? I said bro; no one is here. The place is dead. What do I have to do? Order a bottle? He said no again.. so.. went to a better spot! Saqqara Hookah bear broad across from City Diner! So much better staff! No young deutche bags trying to show how much more testosterone they have.  Saqqara had great fast hookah service; really really great food and best part; was their service. They actually made the effort to cater to their guest.   Fez.. you are the old 2017. Do better 2018! Saqqara; keep up the great work! You'll squash the competition in no time! [REVIEW_2] No longer liking china king.  Now that abacus delivers; we no longer get china king.   The food quality is okay.  We had a couple of pretty weak dishes.  Used to like the Hunan chicken and Hunan shrimp.  But last couple of times we ordered; we were disappointed in the quality and flavor. [REVIEW_3] Horrible experience tonight our service never checked on us. We had to ask the host for boxes; napkins drinks etc. Plus our food was cold. The ribs were burnt or over cooked. The food would have been good if it was warm. Ciara was able to give us complementary cornbread [REVIEW_4] Please; this place makes a semi-new menu and raised their prices. The food is very mediocre. i just started cooking and i make a couple pasta dishes which include spaghetti and lemon chicken piccatta.  As a beginner in cooking I can judge this place's food is horrible. A day after the food looked like it had been out for weeks. Good food can last for a day or two.When i went in there to eat the hostess was nice. first; we ordered a glass a wine. he poured the wine; missed the glass and some spilled on the table and he just ignored it. hello. idiot. waitressing 101. go back. well needless to say. not worth your money at all. ive been there during happy hour with girlfriends and its fine. not a 'high end' restaurant by any means even though they try to make it that way. [REVIEW_5] That's the last time I go there. I went to mail a package; and when I went to pay the $5. 55 cent charge; he said ""Oh; you want to use that debit card? That will cost you an extra $1.00.  So now they are penalizing you for using debit? From now on; I will drive my butt back to the post office and mail my stuff like I used to. [REVIEW_6] Our sales person C.C was great she did everything she can to get me into the car; i was approved was handed the keys to the car etc. even had me put all my things from my trade in car to my new car; once we get to the finance dept. to sign the final paperwork; We were there for about 4hours that day; they tell me that they forgot to include sales tax from my lease trade in to the car I'm purchasing; which would bring my payments up to $24 per month which would bring my monthly payments to about $491 instead of the $461 we agreed on or i could pay the $930 est. now. I advise them all i could do was the amount we agreed on could not put down anything more. The next day i have Nick contact me and stated if i put down another $1;000 they could help me out; i stated  i could not; he basically told me that ""we are doing you a favor and helping you out due to your credit history; you could pay this now or later but you will have to pay the sales tax"". I felt like he was talking down to me and very unprofessional; i advised him could anything else be done since it was a error on there part; he basically stated no; and said if i could not make another $1;000 down on top of the $1;000 I' already putting down there nothing they could do; and kept saying we are bascially helping you out b/c of your credit history and just kept repeating it; when i stated i could not; he hung up the phone. This has been the worse delearship i honestly have been to; after spending 4hours on Saturday there and another 4hours on Monday.. [REVIEW_7] I dropped off a suit that I needed cleaned last week and was told to pick it up on Friday. When I came in I was told it wasn't ready yet and I could pick it up on Saturday. I come back on Saturday to find them closed for 3 days. Now I have to go buy a new suit for a funeral today. This is very unacceptable [REVIEW_8] Service sucks here around noon been waiting over an hour for a simple breakfast for 2. The food smells great if I could only damn well eat it. Like for real I've seen like 4 groups walk in order; eat and leave and we haven't got anything yet. [REVIEW_9] Will not return. Have given this location numerous second chances for improved customer service; but have observed no positive changes. Their drive thru service is terrible; both in terms of employee attitude and communication skills as well as their seriously lacking audio technology. This location is a complete disappointment and in need of a serious management overhaul. [REVIEW_10] Ordered an iced mocha  and an iced white chocolate mocha and they were both was awful.  They  had NO coffee flavor or chocolate flavor at all; very watered down.  Even went back and asked the girl to add another shot and why.  I think she remade them; instead of just adding another shot.  Still had NO flavor.  Not even sure how you could make it that bad.  We both ended up throwing them away on the way out.  So sad; not even worth drinking. [REVIEW_11] This place is super unprofessional. The manager who says his name is ""Johnson"" is extremely unprofessional. He doesn't understand that when working in a place of business where people are accompanied by their children you cannot curse out loud. He also doesn't understand that of a customer comes in close to closing time you don't tell them to hurry up. I don't care how good the food is. I wouldn't know because I lost my appetite and left. This guy is trash. And the management should realize that he's a reflection of them and their business. Definitely stay away. If you're starving; eat air. This place is terrible [REVIEW_12] Don't go here. They gave me grief over the groupon then didn't bother to actually change my oil filter or tell me that they hadn't changed it so I drove 5k miles on an old filter. Crappy customer service; rude attitude; find somewhere better. [REVIEW_13] Almost $4 for a slice of pizza??  I went to NY Pizza after a Mardi Gras parade last week. (Price gouge much?) The woman at the counter presented us with two options for individual slices: pepperoni and spinach. We asked why we couldn't see any green on top of the spinach pizza and she told us ""The spinach is under the crust"" (spoiler alert: there was no spinach!). The service was prompt; despite them being busy; and we paid and left. Within ten steps of leaving the front door; the cheese on the ""spinach"" slice slid off the bread and fell to the ground. Granted; I think this is probably in part due to the pizza-holder; but cheese should never slide off a pizza that easily. What a waste of $4. I won't be back. [REVIEW_14] Chili was watery with grissley meat.  Sent back and exchanged for chicken tortilla. Ice in soda was mildew.  Asked for manager and he said he couldn't smell the mildew. Baloney.  The ice was contaminated.  Don't eat here!!!! [REVIEW_15] AWFUL. I have been there more than once; and it was never great but ok. However the most recent time we went was the WORST EXPERIENCE I have ever had at a restaurant. We were sat and no one ever came to our table; I had to go get them; she got us the wrong appetizer; the food was awful and cold; everything took forever even though the restaurant was empty!!! The waitress was just terrible; I had to go find her several times. We almost got up and left and I wish we had! At the end of it our check was wrong and I never complain but when I did finally talk to the manager she didn't even care and did nothing about it. She didn't apologize or offer any kind of restitution. On our way out I did see that waitress was eating at a table; that would explain why she never came to ours!",0
70,"[REVIEW_1] I go to this subway once a week; the people who work in here have been her for years and really know how to load a sub up with everything you like; the place is always clean and the folks are friendly; best subway around. [REVIEW_2] I'm not particularly a fan of the Century Hospitality restaurants and I hadn't been to a Deluxe BB location in a few years so I decided to give it another shot the other week.   The atmosphere is cool but when you bite into the burger it is such a let down. Their overpriced burgers (and sides) are so disappointing that it brings tears to my eyes. Nobody in my party enjoyed their eats and nobody would come back.   The burgers sounds delicious from the description but in reality they are boring; dry; and void of any sort of flavor. I don't know how the Century Group can keep these locations afloat let alone keep expanding.   It's really not that hard to make even a decent burger and somehow Deluxe Burger Bar fails. DO NOT GO. [REVIEW_3] 1 Tippling Place is one of my favorite Philly bars; with a relaxing lounge atmosphere; kind service; and great cocktails.   On my visit; I had a delicious and refreshing Eastside; which was a fantastic version of my favorite cocktail. I sampled my friend's Blackmail (rum; lime; honey; blackberry; and champagne); which was so good I thought I'd get it next time.   There is a happy hour T-F that looked pretty good. My only complaint is that the kitchen closes much sooner than the bar. So that food side of the menu is superfluous after 9 pm or so on the weekends. [REVIEW_4] This is my second bad experience in a row at Stefano's. Tonight; I waited over 45 minutes for a call-in order they said would take 15 minutes. Then they were out of Greek dressing and told me they'd ""been out for a while"" - how does a Greek Italian restaurant run out of Greek dressing? [REVIEW_5] What a dive! It took the new owners no time to return Kelly's back to its dive status of yesteryear. The food is so-so. It's dumpy and smelly. The floor is sticky. The tables and chairs are a mess. The silverware is grungy. Not fit for anyone but drunken college kids Best to go to a restaurant if you want to keep your appetite and eat. This is just a place to watch kids puke out front; if that's what you;re into. [REVIEW_6] It's 11:29pm; they close at 1am their kitchen closes  at 12am. So when we asked to be sat on the rooftop; the hostess; non most-est; said that all the tables are dirty and that she personally would have to ""set that up for us."" We told her not to worry about it and adios'd MF [REVIEW_7] I ordered the 1st day they were open from grubhub for carryout. They accepted my order and said it was ready before I walked in. I walked into the restaurant and not only was my order not ready; but everyone who ordered at the counter getting their meal before mine; and they were getting it for half price.   I watched 9 people come in; order; and get their food before me; but pay half what I did because I ordered online. I sat there for 45 minutes despite the fact that I ordered ahead of everyone else there; paid double what they did for their food; and was confirmed that the order was ready.  I was apologized to frequently for the wait; but at no point was I offered any explanation as to why I waited 9 times longer than those ordering at the counter; or why they told grubhub it was ready; or why it was charged at twice the price as at the counter (delivered I would understand; but I picked it up).   I live a block and a half away (315 N Senate). I had hoped it would be a place that I could carry out from often; but I was thoroughly disappointed. All said; the food was OK; but the experience was absolutely horrible. Due to that experience I would recommend either Bento Asian (mostly Japanese; $2.50 delivery) or the China King at 148 N Deleware (free delivery) for Asian delivery or carry-out. DO NOT ORDER HERE FROM GRUBHUB OR ANY OTHER CARYOUT/DELIVERY APP/SITE. [REVIEW_8] This place is a joke. Always had been. Nickel and Dime you. I worked here for 10 years and was let go after the flood for no reason other than we don't need you anymore. Employees are nothing more than a number. [REVIEW_9] If I could give them 0 stars I would. Horrible customer service. I order my coffee as follows; cold brew; no water; 2 shots. This tote always gives me and issue with this order saying that they cannot make it as follows; although the app offers that as an option for online ordering; and every other Starbucks out there has zero complications with this order. Infuriating. [REVIEW_10] We went here; on advice from a newspaper review.  What a disappointment!  The bread was like Wonder Bread; with a dipping ""marinara"" that was red just like sauce straight from a can; no simmering! The food all lacked flavor; and that is being very kind & considerate! [REVIEW_11] We love good food and would rather have a fine meal in a mediocre space than a lousy meal in an elegant space.  Alas; our first (and last) experience here gave us a lousy meal in a mediocre setting.  * The space is drab and dreary. * Tables crammed too close together * Noise level excessively high - impossible to have a relaxed conversation; have to compete with too-loud talking at too-close tables; flatware and plates rattling on the stone tabletops * Cheesy; cheap paper napkins at a not-cheap restaurant * Worn; scuffed; cheap diner-type flatware  * Bread that came with the hummus was stale; tasteless * Rice and vegetable accompanied all four entrees - rice tasteless and lukewarm; greens mushy; overcooked; oily and unrecognizable * Entrees rushed out before we had finished our apps * For our wine; we were given old; small; worn-out flute-shaped glasses - totally inappropriate   All in all; an entirely disappointing BYO meal at any cost; but especially so for close to $160 including gratuity for four apps; four entrees; two desserts. [REVIEW_12] Service today was soooooo slow. 1.5 hours today to get simple lunch. Food was also awful which was really the worst. Oyster Po boy was disgusting and couldn't eat half of it. My colleague couldn't finish his chicken blt either because it was so bad. One of worst meals I've had in a long time. Zero stars are more appropriate. Do no go here. [REVIEW_13] Absolutely the worst meal I've had. The pizza was cold; the gyro meat looked like it was yesterday's offering; red potatoes were cold. $35 with two soft drinks. Upscale setting for awful food. Neighboring restaurants were full. Pita Jungle was empty on a Sunday night. [REVIEW_14] My most recent conversation with Comcast (copy and pasted).

It really shouldn't take a whole month just to get some freakin Internet! [REVIEW_15] The Loop looks great on paper but living there was just average and overpriced. The worst thing though was dealing with the management; very frustrating! On move in day a bronken blind was reported and still has not been fixed a year later. Ants moved in soon after my son did and they were lucky enough to stay the year too. Management did not respond to emails or to any other efforts to contact them with problems or questions. When my son moved out; leaving the room in tip top condition; we were told the security deposit would be returned within a week. Six weeks later still no deposit. Its nearly impossible to get someone on the phone to help so finally an email told us they sent our deposit to the wrong address! Instead of getting our deposit to us quickly; knowing they made a huge mistake; they claim they could only get us our money in another three to six weeks! The management at The Loop is terrible! Live somewhere else!",2
71,[REVIEW_1] Ordered take out from this place tonight. It was by far the worst meal I have ever had. I ordered the chicken parmesan. This is a pretty hard dish to screw up but they did a fine job of it. It was an unidentifiable piece of gray rubbery meat (I think). The breading was soggy and I needed a steak knife to cut the chicken. I literally could not chew it; it was so tough. The garlic bread it came with; was also disgusting! It was greasy and hard. Yuck! My husband had a sauted chicken campagniola with veggies which was marginally better. The chicken was so overdone; it made it hard to stomach. The food was so disgustingly greasy that the brown bag they gave us broke. Uggh!  If you get food from this place; be warned. Maybe stick with the pizza. [REVIEW_2] I really like this place. Josie cut my hair. She was super nice and knew exactly what I wanted. I am a man with long hair; and she did a great job of giving me a nice cut that has some layers and shape to it without it looking too lady-like. Perfect. She gave me samples of the product she used and she told me to bring my dog next time; which was very nice. [REVIEW_3] Let me be the first to say this place is no better than the crappy reviews for the previous Radisaon Hotel that occupied this spot. Service: slow; crappy. Bathrooms: I found it amusing they went to the trouble to decoratively fold the toilet paper like a flag at Arlington; when they didn't even stock soap (had to go to front desk for that). We thought Theresa sucked; then realized it's because they were sleep number beds that you could not inflate. Front desk lady didn't even understand that there was no apparatus to inflate it. When the maintenance guy came-with hands so dirty; looked like he just crawled out of a messy turbine- he had to handle the sheets to access the air plug with the one inflating machine. Evidently; he didn't get one of the mattresses plugged back up; because it slowly deflated over night. What an absolute crap hole. We had seen online that it was recently renovated- hahaha. Maybe they have just started; but; I don't think so.  They need to replace the mattresses or get the adjusters for the sleep number back. Just to be at a base level. Never again for this gal! [REVIEW_4] Great pizza! Amazing salads! Quick and friendly service at any of their locations! I highly recommend their chopped salad! [REVIEW_5] This place overall probably one of the best chill spots ever the bartenders are very personable. They remember their regulars. :) always have some random movie on thats always a nice ice breaker to talk to people huge selection of beers! What more do u want?? [REVIEW_6] Absolutely one of the best shops in the country. Incredibly patient and helpful in both rebuilding and choosing a bike. [REVIEW_7] There is no help in the appliance section. If you do receive help they don't know what they are talking about. Bad service. Sears home Appliance store in Springfield is definitely a better option if you're looking to get great prices and great service [REVIEW_8] Great food. Awesome beer selection. Found this place by accident; definitely worth it. Can't remember the name of the burger I had; but it was topped with pork roll; onions and a fried egg. [REVIEW_9] My hairdresser was very thorough in getting details of what I wanted. Then she checked frequently during the haircut to make sure I liked it.  I did! [REVIEW_10] Very friendly staff! In and out really quick and they even applied a coupon! I work across the street from this store and will be back for future hair cuts! Keep up the great work team! [REVIEW_11] First time trying this place as we always drive past it. We felt so rushed. We were looking for a relaxing date night. We sat at a regular table. The bartender who sat us very friendly. The girl who took our order didn't get the order right. I ordered sashimi prior to my meal which never even came out. She was in such a hurry didn't even seem like she was listening. We had three apps; soup and salad all come at the same time. Who does that? It doesn't need to be fine dining but at least let us enjoy one course at a time. Needless to say we won't go back. [REVIEW_12] You get what you see--chicken fingers. They also serve wings and other overpriced items like mac and cheese (mediocre) and pastries (meh).   The sauces are unique and probably the best part about this place as you won't be able to find sauces like this elsewhere. Be watchful of how full the sauce is because some of the containers are not completely full and you get jipped. Sadly you can't sample the sauces without having to buy them. My favorite is bar b q sauce. It has a slight acidic vinegar kick; but isn't bittersweet. Maybe they cut back on the sugar? The chipotle lime mayo is great. It isn't too creamy and oily. The chipotle is subtle; almost dull and a little bit more would make it better and bold. I found myself having to double dunk the chicken in this sauce to really taste it. You always finish it wishing you had a little more. I've tried almost all of them and none of them are too memorable that I can recall anything great or bad about the rest of the sauces.  The breading is thin and crisp; which I appreciate. With one bite you taste the breading and chicken; and not just breading on heavily breaded chicken that other places might serve. The breading can be over salty and seasoned too much. Don't mistake this for rich and intense. It is salty. I end up drinking a lot of water with this meal partially due to this. What makes the breading suck is that it is not always fresh. Who knows how long the chicken has been sitting out.  The meat can be hit or miss; the chicken can be a little parched. This is disappointing when you have a whole pound of chicken to consume that will leave your mouth dry and leave you bloated after you drink a lot to quench your thirst and high sodium intake. More often then not; I always get the dried; salty chicken instead of the juicy; tender chicken that I once got at my very first visit. Perhaps I am unlucky and get the left over stale pieces that have been sitting out long. I can only recall once when my chicken was tender and juicy when they first opened.I try to avoid wasting money here because I have not had the same type of meal since my first. However; out of desperation to try something different than the usual univ city food; I have eaten here a few times to make this review justified.  What my friends and I would like to do is split up and someone get french fries from Greek Lady and the others get chicken from Wishbone. We would satisfy our elementary palates by eating chicken fingers and french fries. If you are willing to walk a few more blocks; Allegros has really good curly fries but portions are a lot bigger when you eat at the place.  I would have given this place 1.5 stars for the food; but they once cancelled a chicken wing eating contest on my friends and me just hours prior to the event with poor explanation so I knock it down to 0.5 stars; but yelp doesn't have 0.5 increments. [REVIEW_13] Service wasn't good; wait time wasn't bad but it seemed like our food had been just sitting up in the window because it was so cold. My steak seemed really raw for medium rare. Got no butter with my now tiny rolls. Was really sad paying 40$ for mediocre food. Friends sides came in a styrofoam bowl. Not planning on returning. Sad thing is that it used to be so good. :( [REVIEW_14] We drive out of town to Philadelphia just to eat here. We have been here many times over the past 5 years. I can only say that the tofu soup (and everything else)  here always tastes so good. They always get the spiciness right; and we have never had a complaint here! This is a must-try in Philadelphia if you're a fan of Korean food. [REVIEW_15] One star isn't even low enough for how I am feeling right now. Wings over broadway use to be my favorite wing stop in Tucson until recently when we ordered 16 boneless wings.   We were DISGUSTED to find what appears to be parts of a worm inside of our wings. Usually service is alright. But that night they also happened to have the lady who appeared to be a manager lecturer one of her cooks for 10 minutes while people piled up at the counter for the one waitress on staff room orders and ran food to tables.   Needless to say; I will not be returning. And I truly do wish many others see this review and do not return as well. I spent 30 some dollars on horrible service and disgusting food.,8
72,"[REVIEW_1] The place is absolutely beautiful! Nice and clean!!! Staffs are wonderful and nice! They let you try any juice flavor you want. Super refreshing and organic! My all time favors is almond milk;raw honey artichoke& chia coconut.b [REVIEW_2] Really good food and great service! They have their own fish market right next door so I bought Jambalaya and Gumbo to take back to Miami! [REVIEW_3] There are a lot of rather middling restaurants in kirkwood so I was very pleasantly surprised when this place turned out to be very good. We came at a bit of an off time but had exceptional service. My husband had a delicious and generously portioned fish and chips sandwich (it was huge). I had a Burger. I really wasnt expecting much but it was juicy and flavorful despite the fact I ordered it medium well (I know I know). Everything was tasty; the atmosphere was very pleasant and the staff were great. [REVIEW_4] Never disappointed at Maynards. Outstanding Arizona wines. The celery bisque and bistro salad made for excellent appetizers. As main dishes we had trout and swordfish respectively. The fish was exquisitely prepared; leaving its inherent flavor come through; not smothering it in sides. To top it off; an outstanding peach budino. Attentive prompt service. Great experience. [REVIEW_5] Yummy Sushi for a good price!!  The whole familly LOVES it here and the friends i have sent over there weren't diappionted and have become regulars too. Great customer service everytime we go. And if you have a person in your party who doesn NOT want sushi; they can order chinese food from Asian Wok (next door) Works for parents with Non sushi eating kids!! =) [REVIEW_6] Great lunch!!  We saw all the people eating here so we decided it must be a good place to go!! The food was amazing !! We took other's advice and tried it all!! Mac and cheese was great so was the banana pudding.  I had the Chilean sandwich and would skip the bun and the slaw next time. The French fries were amazing !! [REVIEW_7] Recently had my car tinted by Orange Tint and Tune and had fantastic service.  They offer a car pick up service if you live within 4 miles of their shop which is extremely convenient.  Carlos was my technician and went over all the tint options with me and even adjusted the grade of the tint after I expressed the look that I was trying to achieve.  That's the kind of customer care that deserves 5 stars.  In addition; the receptionist was very pleasant and the owner Dustin even followed up to see how my service was. [REVIEW_8] First off if there was a lesser rating I could give it I would. Never in my whole entire life have I ever been to a place that handled a situation so horribly. So a group of us went in for Valentine's Day; we had a reservation for 8 and were sat by 845; no big deal we were just a bit cranky and hungry. The host was very nice and was trying her best.   We finally get sat and get drinks ordered and Our appetizers. It's going well; our server was nice and we were happy. Now this is where it goes down hill. Our appetizers come out about 5-10 mins apart. We brushed it off. A party that got sat after us were now getting their entrees? We start getting irritable at this time we've been in the restaurant for 2 hours. We finally start getting out entrees. 5 people are missing theirs. Sever comes over tells our friend their out of what she wanted. Would've been nice to know before everyone stared receiving their food. But she got to pick whatever she wanted for free; not bad. Everyone is now done with their meals and My friend beside me never got her food. By this time the restaurant is basically empty. The manager comes over and just goes "" what did you have"" my friend told her then she just walked away. No apology. Nothing. Her food finally comes out and she asks our sever why was she just now receiving her food? He replies with ""oh you know the kitchen gets slammed; things happen"" our jaws nearly hit the floor. Granted they comped her meal. But everything was poorly executed and the manager never stopped by to apologize; our server never apologized.    I guessed they assumed that they were gonna go down in flames cause they thought passing out a $5 off coupon for next time would do anything. Safe to say we spent 3 hours in a restaurant for a lousy experience. The food was decent but not worth it. Like the saying goes "" you can fix lousy food with great service but you can't fix lousy service with great food"" and we don't ever; ever plan on coming back here. I get that it was Valentine's Day and it was busy; completely understood but it's the mangers job to smooth over the situation. Comping the food is great but that doesn't fix anything. Get it together macaroni grill. [REVIEW_9] Great bowls & sauce. All of the ingredients were fresh and healthy. Service was great. I'm going to become a regular at this place. [REVIEW_10] Amazing. Can't go wrong with this place.   Tried something new every time I come and nothing disappoints.   Shakes are a must; too! [REVIEW_11] I have used Steve twice now to do jobs at my house. Today I had him come by and replace some of the ""criss-cross"" redwood trellis that was used as a ""skirt"" around my deck. My puppy had chewed on it. Steve showed up with the right materials and tools and was done before no time. He is very handy; courteous; and does excellent work. I plan on using him again for my next ""fix-it"" job that I don't have the time; skills; or tools to do. [REVIEW_12] Great location when the weather is good. Food was great and came out fast. The tacos looked tempting; but i had the pretzel burger and it was really good. They executed well - we will be back. [REVIEW_13] As avid brewery connoisseurs and current Nashville locals; we were extremely and pleasantly surprised with our experience at Tennessee Brew Works this evening.   It was a dreary; rainy night and as we pulled up we were fairly apprehensive about the string of dark warehouses and quiet alleys. It all changed quickly as we walked into the ""Tennessee Fill Station"" (or some name similar) portion of the building. The fellas working there directed us to the ""Tennessee Tap Room"" (or some name similar) portion of the building that overlooked 2 stories into the ""Tennessee Brew Works"" (or some name similar) portion of the building where the brewing takes place. I've added the specifics because this is the first group audacious and clever enough to pull off all three portions under one roof.... and to still comply with Tennessee's archaic liquor laws! If sticking it to the man isn't enough reason for you to check it out.... keep reading.   The tap room is super neat and cleverly laid out with patios; long & community-oriented tables; a flying bridge or ""catwalk"" and a steady stream of live; local music. It's largely non-smoking (which is enough to convince me to cross the bridge from East Nashville) and has a few TVs to cater to the football crowds.   Biggest fortes:  - The staff is amazing. The smiles and enthusiasm when they start talking about their beer are a sweet relief. They're excited! They're adventurous! They aren't pretentious. Real People. - The beers are fresh & different. They keep it local. They aren't afraid to venture from the norm. They add their own zing and flair.... and for that; I respect them. - They appreciate the food & beer pairing concept. They're bringing in great food to compliment their brews. It's a movement.  If you've managed to read all of that rambling- you can ignore any other reviews and just go ahead and get there. [REVIEW_14] Loved District Donuts! Great outdoor seating & AMAZING donuts and sliders. I will be visiting again for sure! [REVIEW_15] Hidden gem. My wife & I ate here twice on our trip to Tucson. Great bread; good breakfast food.  We had to limit ourselves from gorging on all the delicious baked sweets.  Service was friendly and you can tell that they take pride in what they do. Very affordable too.",14
73,"[REVIEW_1] We live in an era where a lot of shopping and other business is conducted on line.  How many times I have called a store; an agency or somewhere else and spent 10-20 minutes trying to find a real human to answer questions.  Then we were referred to Rob Dischert.  We ran into a brick wall getting our mortgage because of some Fannie Mae rule and we thought we were in serious trouble.  We had taken money from our retirement accounts to close; assuming that getting a mortgage in the 60 day window to redeposit our funds would be easy.  Not so.  But someone in our condo complex referred us to Rob Dischert who; it appears; is very good at pulling rabbits out of a hat when necessary.  Rob got the mortgage we thought was unattainable.  Then when the first company with whom we had spoken suddenly called with a lower rate; Rob immediately went up the chain at Homebridge at matched that rate.    For some reason; we ran into a lot of problems this time with Fannie Mae rules and getting through the process was stressful; to say the least.  But Rob supported us throughout the sobering adventure.  He was our ""go to"" guy for virtually any questions we had.  At the end with all the paperwork done and approval in hand; Rob came to our home with the title company representative and walked us through the paperwork step by step.  Fannie Mae has changed a lot of the forms we were used to; so Rob patiently educated my wife and me regarding all of the stack of documents we had to sign.  In short; Rob delivered stellar service at every step of the mortgage process.  To say we were pleased is an understatement.  The next time we need a mortgage; Rob will be at the top of my list.  He is a great guy who delivers extraordinary service. [REVIEW_2] no bueno...annoyed I couldn't get any service and the prices are a joke. [REVIEW_3] Poor service to start off with. Server was abrupt and seemed to be kind of snippy I guess you could say. Waited 25 minutes for food and when it arrived it was luke warm at best. Something we had never seen before but they would not let a couple pay individually. There were 3 couples in our party. Safe to say we will not be going back. [REVIEW_4] I love this place. Super friendly staff. Great with kids. And the food is amazing. Especially the hash browns. You can also get tomatoes and grits on the side. Yum! And on top of it all it's not hard on the wallet. [REVIEW_5] Cute pet store with a nice variety of natural pet foods. My cats' wet food is 10 cents less a can here compared to Petco. Happy to have just moved within walking distance; will definitely be my new place for pet supplies. [REVIEW_6] Extremely slow service (20 mins in an EMPTY drive thru) and first time around they missed a full half of my order! I come back and they're less than apologetic and proceed to give me 90% of my order! What does it take for a girl to get what she pays for around here?!! Not coming to this location again; just horrible. [REVIEW_7] I try to come by this place every time I drive through Indy. I have had every banh mi sandwich on the menu; and they are all fantastic. Perfect bread; perfect pork; perfect condiments. This is coming from a girl who has had her fair share of banh mi sandwiches in many other places.   But let's not stop at the sandwiches. The rice noodles with pork balls are out of this world. Simply prepared; but fresh; light; and flavorful at the same time. Catfish clay pot also a big hit with me. I can't wait to try the pho in future visits.  In short: every single thing I've tried so far on the menu is right on the money. Don't be turned off by the seedy exterior and weird location. This place is an Indianapolis gem. [REVIEW_8] I used to live right next to Desi Chaat House and pretty much went there just for the grab-and-go mango lassi. If you're in the area; Mood Cafe is definitely the better out of the two. Depending on how busy they are; they will walk you through what exactly each chaat is (and what chaat is if you've never had it); and will make recommendations for whether you are craving something spicy; savory; sweet; etc. I've stuck to the lamb and beef chaats; but all of them are pretty tasty. Customer service definitely prevails on this one. [REVIEW_9] Would give zero stars if possible. Carries literally zero lefty golf clubs for juniors. Does this corrupt corporation think that it's okay to discriminate against 10% of the world population? I will; most definitely; never be returning to this store again. Also; Jared; the man who helped me; was an absolute asshole. Would not recommend at all. Didn't even have bike parking. [REVIEW_10] Being highly recommended by friends we decided to pick up a small bundt cake for our daughter's birthday.  We picked it up a couple of days before the party and I was a bit nervous that it wouldn't taste fresh. It was wrapped up in cellophane plastic and in a box; I think this helped the freshness . It was really good and still very fresh. The cake was very cute and a big hit. The frosting wasn't too sweet and the cake was perfect. We got the chocolate with chocolate chips; it wasn't too rich and very moist. The princess decoration was perfect. [REVIEW_11] I love this place.  Love the Dan Dan noodles; dried pepper shrimp; and wontons.   Service is great.  If you want a great dining experience with excellent food; you must try this place. [REVIEW_12] I looked at many companies that provided this service and chose then based on the customer service attitude that they had when they bid the job and price. I found them to be extremely knowledgeable and professional. I was VERY impressed with BOTH the sales representative and also the crew that actually did the job. My new gutters look really good; are color matched to our home; and were a reasonable price.  I would certainly recommend them to anyone. [REVIEW_13] Had brunch on NYE weekend. The decor is wonderful; you feel cozy the my minute you walk in. Ordered the Eggs Veney and didn't regret that decision because the whole plate was devoured in a matter of minutes. Great food; and a great experience! [REVIEW_14] Mike's is the place to go if you're downtown and looking to satisfy your ice cream craving. Decided to go here after the place we were originally going to had a long wait; and it was a great choice. It was my third time here; and as always I will definitely go back in the future! My parents got the butterscotch shake; sister got the mint chocolate chip; and I got the coffee fudge. Would definitely recommend all of the flavors. [REVIEW_15] Worst hotel I've ever stayed at. Breakfast was terrible; and they had NO sugar in the entire hotel for coffee. We got stuck multiple times in the pool room because of the door not properly working. My sons feet were black from walking barefoot in our room. The water in the bath tub was constantly draining while my son was trying to take a bath. And we only came across one staff member who was polite to us. We checked out and went to a different hotel that was much better.",10
74,"[REVIEW_1] We made reservations; and were seated upstairs about a foot from the band at a table that seemed more like a bar table. After sitting for 45 min with NO SERVICE; just empty glasses and silverware; we left. While leaving the host kindly insisted to grab the manager after we told her what happened. (The hosts were wonderful!)   The manager did nothing besides essentially say that this wasn't typical and to come back. [REVIEW_2] My trip to SB for my step-sisters wedding was during grad week; so i knew the rates were going to be on the higher end. Ive been shopping around and when i came across this hotel's website; it looked like a good deal considering the location; appearance and price. The rate was $160 the first night and $180 the 2nd. When my boyfriend and i arrived;i thought we were in the wrong place.. i couldnt believe THIS was where we were staying! It looked like a run down motel. The Motel 6 next door looked like a 4 star compared to this place. When my bf went to ""check in"" the guy told us its late  so we can take care of the paperwork in the morning; the rooms unlocked and the keys are inside. (wtf?) When we got inside; the room looked NOTHING like the pictures on the website. I felt like i was scammed. The lamps were the ONLY thing that the pics and actual room had in common; other then that everything from the ceiling to the carpet were different!!!! All we wanted to do was have a relaxing weekend and stay in our hotel room but after seeing the room (it just looked dirty and unkempt); we couldnt even stand being in there another minute. We noticed that they offer free wifi so we decided to start looking for rooms near by; and of course... the wifi was so bad that we couldnt even connect to the internet!! The door had a sign with crime dog Mcgruff (Mcgruff?? seriously?! i didnt know he was still around) giving some pointers on how to keep safe... a few things to mention were  - always lock doors and windows ( windows didnt even have latches) - if someone poses as an employee do not open the door  - do not draw attention to yourself such as wearing flashy jewelry; clothes etc.   We decided to leave and drive around and call to find another place... at about 2AM we finally found a place; a little bit more expensive but worth EVERY penny!!!   All in all the reason i am so upset is because of false advertisement and they still went ahead and charged us even after the fact that we had told them that we left because the rooms were nothing like what their website showed.  I will NEVER believe a website again and especially this one. [REVIEW_3] I always admired the cakes in the window of this store and wanted to order my daughters birthday cake here the last few years. I was very excited when my husband agreed on the Cake Boutique to make our cake for her 5th this year. I wanted a nice five layer cake and no expense was to be spared! I cannot even begin to tell you how shocked I was at their terrible customer service. The lady showed me the different cakes and informed me on how much each one was. I told her I liked the three tier cake but might need something bigger since I specifically wanted five layers. She told me the basic starting price and let me know decorations would cost more. I was fine with that and told her I would like to get the order started. When I asked her if I could taste a few flavors she said they don't let people taste for free but I could buy some cupcakes if I wanted to. When I asked if the cupcakes in the case were all the flavors they made; she just shrugged her shoulders and said ""I think so."" So I bought a chocolate; yellow and raspberry filled cupcake. I sat at the table to taste them ( I noticed after I sat down there was a sign on the table that said ""reserved for cake tasting"" ) I then asked her if there was delivery available; since I did not want to risk driving with the cake myself and possibly ruining it. She said for an additional $50 I could get it delivered. I told her my major cross streets and she said she was going to check on something and would be right back. While she was gone I tasted the cupcakes and I could not believe how dry and bland they were. I was really shocked; the raspberry filled one was a little better tasting but not by much. I really cannot tell you what specific flavor they were because she didn't tell me. So as I waited for her I decided not to use them. I can put up with bad customer service if the product is at least amazing but after I sampled it there was no way I was going to pay $600 for a cake and get treated the way I did and have it taste horrible on top of all that. So just because they have a fancy store and nice displays- don't just assume that the service is great and the product is good. I will stick with Nadine's- they have outstanding customer service and the cakes never let me down. [REVIEW_4] Went to see Star Wars Rogue One yesterday in 3D.  Buying the tickets was a breeze; and the atmosphere was inviting.  Found the comfortable seats with no problem and ordered right away before the movie began.  I ordered pretzel sticks - food was hot; prompt & delicious.  I was excited for the movie to begin.  Once the advertisements were done and the movie started; that's when I noticed something wasn't right.  The entire screen was so dark that I was not able to make out the faces of the actors on the screen.  I kept lifting up the 3D glasses to see if it made a difference - nope.  The two people seated next to me were noticing the same and complaining.  I thought that maybe this is how the movie was filmed?  Then it got worse.  Even with the 3D glasses on; the shadows in the background on the screen were double and there was no discerning most actors' faces at all.  I got up and went to the lobby and asked for the manager.  The gentleman wore a blue shirt; middle age with a beard; said that this was the 3D experience; it was a ""closed-system"" and there was nothing he could do.  I simply asked him to come with me into the theater to see with his own eyes how dark it was.  He would not and did not.  I suspect this wasn't the first time he's heard this from a customer.  I've seen normal movies at this location before; but this was my first; and last experience with their 3D in room #1. [REVIEW_5] So disappointed; I'm so embarrassed! This is a $50 mixed bouquet! Trader Joe's makes better arrangement! Mostly green filler with a couple mum; iris and Gerber daisy. [REVIEW_6] Came in at 9:59 am when they open at 10 am; door was unlocked and everything but they lady was very rude and told us they weren't open. Walked out a couple steps turned around and she had flicked the open sign on. Decided not to walk back because of the poor customer service. [REVIEW_7] You're better off waiting on the restaurant next door [even if the wait is 3-4 hours]. Our appetizer had a dead fly in it and we were told by a manager we would get 10% off... thanks to our waiter [Alvin; who was the only decent part of our visit] it was eventually removed. We then received our meal and the jambalaya [which tasted straight out of a box] had hair present. The person receiving the jambalaya is bald so it had to have come from the kitchen. This wasn't surprising as most of the staff spent 80% of their time outside smoking and laughing[with their aprons on]. The catfish plate didn't come with catfish; there was some other cheaper fish present...the seafood fettuccine only had shrimp and Alfredo sauce out of the jar in it; I had to ask and wait for crawfish. We didn't ever receive part of our meal but it came on the check. When we complained and asked to speak to the manager; he was short and unaccomodating. He never once apologized for the uncleanliness and disorganization. This was the worst experience I've ever had in New Orleans and every aspect but our waiter. [REVIEW_8] If I could give it a zero; I would. I order a plain hamburger; and realized they put  bacon in it (which I am allergic to and unable to eat) after two bites. When I went back to the drive-through window to complain (didn't realize the actual restaurant was open--it was almost 2 after all...); the guy took back the burger; said nothing; and disappeared. After 2 minutes of awkwardly making conversation with the next people in line in their car; he came back and rudely told me I had to go inside to get my food. Which I did. And still did not get an apology.  I refuse to go back there after that ordeal; which is a shame; because it's nice to have a variety of places to go to after DT. Guess Freebirds it is! [REVIEW_9] Negative 5 stars. Worst service and slow; 15 minutes for 1 panini. They use microwaves people so its not even fresh; just crap. I'm sure they don't CLEAN them either. Disgusting; Get Real. I will go buy a frozen breakfast sandwhich & cook it my own CLEAN microwave which isn't cooked with everybody else's crap. NEVER AGAIN will go here. Btw i waited so long i got my money back. Keep your crappy sandwhich and enjoy [REVIEW_10] I should have known it would be a bad experience from the beginning. The chips tasted stale and the salsa tasted like ketchup. Old el paso salsa from the jar would have been better. The guacamole lacked flavor; I suggest they add some cumin. The enchiladas tasted like they had Vodka sauce on them and the onions inside tasted like they weren't cooked. The tacos had cabbage on them.  The best part of the meal was the margarita. The strawberry margarita was really good.  The gentleman collecting the plates dropped a dirty knife on my cream colored shirt. I didn't say anything; we just got the check and left. We will not be returning. [REVIEW_11] Sat down over a half hour; only miso and drinks served. Waiting for actual food ordered or someone to cook it ....waiting ... [REVIEW_12] BEWARE!  ZERO STARS! Do not buy here! Only received part of my order.  I called to advise them that I did not receive all of my products. The small box had 8 of the 9 items; and a blow dryer would not fit. They told me to send a picture of the invoice they sent me; and they would respond by email.  72 hours later I received an email that they confirmed that all items were shipped and they could not assist me.  I called a second time and the lady told me to call the Post Office for further assistance and that the post office is responsible for my lost item.  I asked how many boxes were shipped; and she replied ""one"".  I informed her again that the box I received had the small items in it and could not hold a blow dryer.  She said there was nothing she could do.  They reviewed a video and it showed the items being packed. I was placed on hold several times. She told me to take a picture of the package box used to ship the items and email it.  I sent the pictures of the box with a Capri Sun package beside of it to show that a boxed blow dryer would not fit in the box.  Have not heard anything several days later.  Very frustrating!! Horrible customer service and very offensive. They accused me and the post office of stealing items. [REVIEW_13] I have taken my small pomimo here 4 times and before I hadn't had any complaints. I had set up an appointment on Thursday which I had walked to and the power was out but they still told me to keep my dog there. 30 mins after being home I get a call saying they can't do it and that we need to reschedule. I rescheduled for Saturday morning; two hours they call me tell me to come get him. I paid 60$ and his haircut is literally a hack job; i could of done something similar with my boyfriends trimmers! I called to inform them and they were not picking up my call.. What a waste of my Christmas money! [REVIEW_14] STAY AWAY from this place unless you want to possibly be hit by a ""drunk gambler ""coming from there.  It's no wander this Joe Bob's is never busy.  The only thing that the owners and bartenders care about are the gamblers that get over-served and gamble there daily.   I'm definitely gonna stay away from that part of town after 4ish as that's when the ""heavy hitters"" come in to support the greasy; dirty; place that really only cares about their gamblers.  The kitchen has some kinda mold issues that literally smells like a sewer plant.  The 2 gals that have made a career outta this dump rely on the drunkards to tip them ""big"" if they win on the slots.  This is a very sad version of any kinda chicken joint or sports bar.  The greed that the owners share is obvious as flat screens are cheap these days and these guys can't even loosen their hands on the ""gambling profit"" to invest in to this dump.   Is sad as the original owners did a great job and these new guys don't care about anything except the profit from the slot machines; including the nasty food they serve.  The bartenders are high-strung and anything but friendly; unless of course; you are gambling big and they have a chance at a big tip.   Your better off going to the fast food chicken joint across the stree t""El Pollo Loco"" and guessing the kitchen is cleaner and the staff is friendlier and you won't be subjected to the daily drunks that drive to and from this place daily.  VERY SCARY!!! [REVIEW_15] I ordered a refrigerator from Menard's on 06/15 and received an estimated delivery date of 07/15.  I accepted this long lead time because I wanted that particular refrigerator.    On 07/25; I called the store and was informed the order was still pending at the vendor; and they would call me back with a status in 20 minutes.  It is now more than one hour later; and I have not received a phone call.  Over the years; I have purchased appliances at Sears; Lowes; and Home Depot; and have not ever experienced something like this.    At this point; I want a full refund; so I can purchase a refrigerator somewhere else.",0
75,"[REVIEW_1] Yellow Cab taxis are in an unsafe mechanical condition.  Ride them at the risk of your own personal injury.  In Sept. 2015; I arrived at Tampa airport and took a Yellow Cab to the convention center.  The cab was a Ford Crown Victoria; probably only about 5 years old; but in quite poor mechanical condition -- basically a ""beater"".  While driving on the highway; the hood opened up and smashed into the windshield --- shattering it and blinding the driver.  He got over to shoulder; and luckily nobody hit us in the process.  His comment was interesting: ""I hate when this happens"".  After waiting 15 minutes on the shoulder; another Yellow cab showed up; already with passengers on board; and I got in.  After dropping the first passengers off at their destination; I was finally taken to the convention center.  The driver had the audacity of charging the full rate for the ride.  The incident was a direct consequence of the disrepair of the cars.  Apparently; the hood's latch had worn out; and air had gotten under it while we were at highway speeds.  I took an ExecuCar on my return to the airport. [REVIEW_2] Probably one of the WORST experiences I've had in a restaurant :( Let me just start off saying; the food is good! Nothing wrong with any of the food; the chefs are amazing and we all enjoyed our food. The problem was with the service....  We made a reservation for 9 at 7:15 and we ended up getting their around 6:45. We were told we needed to wait because there wasn't enough chefs; which is TOTALLY fine and understandable. Then the woman at the front seats a party of 2 and another party of 3. So I asked why they were able to sit down before our group (and by this time it was about 7-7:10) and she told me because they had a smaller group.... Okay well if we had a reservation wouldn't we be first to sit down? We didn't care if the chef wasn't ready we just wanted to sit down order drinks and have some appetizers. We were then seated and our server Ivan came over very promptly which was nice. After he got our first round of drinks this is where things went down hill.   We ordered some sushi; simple sushi. Salmon; and shrimp. We ordered 2 rolls; a crunch roll and a shrimp tempura roll. He brought out yellowtail; tuna and 2 veggie rolls. I kindly said that the food wasn't ours and that wasn't what we ordered. He told me that it was and that I was wrong. So I asked to see the sushi paper because maybe I marked the wrong thing. And then he said he threw the paper away but he took the sushi away with a HUGE attitude and said he would go try and find the paper. Well our group could see him in the back area and he pulled the paper out of his apron and came over and said oh yeah I guess it was my fault I brought you guys the wrong stuff.... Okay that's what we tried explaining! The stuff finally comes out and tasted perfect! So then some of us ordered the teppan and we got our miso soup and then once that was done we got our salad. None of us had forks and I'm pretty sure maybe 1 out the 9 of us knew how to use chopsticks so I asked for forks and he said yeah no problem. Well we waited out 10 minutes until we saw him again and couldn't find any other servers to ask for their help so we ended up just eating with our fingers. We finally see Ivan and asked for forks again and he said; ""do you honestly need them right now? Your food isn't being cooked!"" EXCUSE ME! I was so furious that he would even come back with such attitude. All of the girls needed forks and so we told him; yes we need them now. I almost got up to go find them myself! Anyways; chef comes; food turned out good and no Ivan to be found for about 30 minutes. So 2 girls in our group asked for boxes; myself included; and it took him about 15 minutes to get them so I ended up eating the last bit of food I was going to take home. So when he brought my box I said; ""I'm sorry; I don't need the box anymore I finished what I was going to take home; but thank you!"" (very politely) He then came back with ""ok well maybe if I take your plate away you'll stop changing your mind"" WHAT IN THE HELL!!!! At this point I was done trying to be nice. After2 and half hours I was so glad to be leaving! Ivan was so rude to ALL of the girls in our group! I hope if we go back; which we probably won't; that Ivan will not be there. I always try and give people the benefit of the doubt and maybe he was having a bad day; but if your day is that bad; don't come into work and be mean and rude to your customers. I work with the public and believe me; it's hard to always please everyone. But it's unacceptable to be rude to people!! [REVIEW_3] ""Feather free"" in my profile.  ""Feather free"" in my reservation.  ""Feather free"" by special request when I called four hours before arrival.  ""Feather free"" confirmed upon check in.  In the room?  Feathers.  Will Hyatt ever understand how important this is?  Will it take another trip to the emergency room?   And $29/night to park also absurd for St. Louis.  ""Sorry about that sir"" gets old. [REVIEW_4] Went here to redeem Groupon; frist time staff member said she couldn't use system and for me to come back after she extended it. I went back and I was told I was out of luck it expired.  Way to waste my time and very un-Yoga like. I will stick with Wake up Yoga and PSC; they know how to treat people. [REVIEW_5] Very much enjoyed this meal. The restaurant is nice and spacious; great views and on golf course.   The appetizers were good; not great. We got the pull-away rolls which were very nice when they came out warm. The spinach artichoke dip was also good; a little different than you get at most places.   The burger was excellent. I built my own with pretzel bun; bacon; onions and mushrooms. The fries and the onion rings were terrific.   The cookie skillet was a very nice ending; great cookie. It was my birthday and the server took a Polaroid and gave it to us in a nice card- it was a nice touch! [REVIEW_6] Food is terrible and too expensive for how bad it is. Took over 2 hours for delivery. Rude on the phone when we called to see about our order status. Terrible decision to order from this place; never again. [REVIEW_7] This place was awful. I really like Mexican food; but this place is so not Mexican food. My hubby and I went for dinner on a Tues. It was busy for a Tues. so we were excited. We were seated quickly and our server gave us our drinks quickly; but it was a downturn after that. First the chips and salsa were tasteless; I have found better tasting salsa from jar salsa at the grocery store. Also we waited for ridiculous 45 minutes for our food to come out. All we ordered was tacos; a burrito; and one chicken enchilada. Simple freaking meals...I mean come on that should take 10 minutes. After the server gave us our food finally...he never came back to check if we needed anything else. We could not even flag anyone to refill our waters. The burrito and tacos were very bland but edible. The chicken enchilada was the worst enchilada I have ever had. I couldn't even eat it. The red sauce on it tasted like some old can enchilada sauce that has been sitting in their kitchen for awhile. After we were done eating we sat there for another 15 minutes before the server came to our table. I told him I didn't like the enchilada and he did take it off the check; but that doesn't make up for one of the worst service from a restaurant that I have experienced. We won't be back. Good luck Poblanos. [REVIEW_8] Got the geisha; fancy and kampai special rolls; and all 3 were great; we couldn't reach a consensus on the winner! [REVIEW_9] This place is horrible! I recently purchased a jeep from there; and everything seemed great at first. Not 2 days after purchasing the jeep; the front left brake locked up and almost threw me off the road. So I brought the vehicle back and they fixed the front left brake..... Wouldn't you think to check the other one? They didn't and 4 months later the front right brake does the same thing...... Now they say oh well and I have to fork over a bunch of money to fix it! If I spend 30k on a jeep; I shouldn't have these kind of issues nor should I be responsible for it. This place is a disgrace and I  will actively tell people never to go there!!!! Run away from this scam of a place!!! [REVIEW_10] No idea why this place is so highly-favoured by other people - I've had loads of great; authentic and inexpensive Japanese food at other places before and this place simply disappoints. $23 for a lunch box set consisting of a few measly pieces of chicken smothered in cloying teriyaki sauce; disappointing tempura that wasn't even very cripsy at all; and spicy tuna rolls that were only so-so. If you really want good Japanese food; look elsewhere; this place has a posh interior and posh people frequent it but evidently they haven't got good taste for Japanese food. [REVIEW_11] Guy at the counter was rude; the place was filthy; and all around horrible! Would/will not recommend this place at all! [REVIEW_12] I dont leave reviews but had to as my experience tonight left a really sour taste in my mouth.  Walked in the restaurant to place a take out order for two pho dishes. Paid by card & left a 4$ tip on a 22$ takeout order.   As they gave me the food i asked if i could have hot sauce as well and was told by the young man that thats 1$ extra... i had no cash only card but i was surprised because i was just there yesterday cus my bf is sick and picked up an order with the hot sauce without having to pay anything for it. The older man yesterday was super friendly to me and said if i ever need sauce to just ask so i was baffled that now i had to pay for it. Additionally this is the same sauce that is sitting on the table. I didn't ask for extra sauce! I let the young man know that if he wanted to charge me a $1 to go ahead but i had gotten it for free before to which he replied the rules have changed. And when i said that was yesterday he mumbled and walked away and begrudgingly filled a container for me and as he handed it said next time its a 1$...   Why do i have to pay extra to get the same sauce sitting on the table which i got for free the other day. Secondly i tipped u $4 on takeout. Ive worked in the business. People rarely tip for pickup so you still have the nerve to be a dick... I walked away with the food pissed off that this really just happened. and he had the nerve to yell nothing is free as i was walking away. All this commotion occurred with customers in the store.  Great customer service!   Oh and when i get home only one bag of toppings was provided for two orders; with only 1 lime wedge to be shared by two people...   Sucks as this is the only pho place around and i finally grew to like their pho. Refuse to go back and give my money to that little twerp. [REVIEW_13] Love this place! Great food; and the owner will help you pick something if you are not sure what to order. Try the king fisher beer. Save room for desert! Great change of pace from regular boring food [REVIEW_14] Suzie is great! Professional; efficient; personable. Everything you'd want in an aesthetician. I've been going to her for years and I will for years to come. [REVIEW_15] Prices are absolutely ridiculous! They charge almost $12 per item to dry clean. I should've realized something was amiss when I didn't see any signage that talked pricing. Shame on me for not asking first but every other place I've ever been charges $4 or less. The employee couldn't articulate what; precisely; causes the increase in price over the competition. I will assume that little angels kiss the clothes clean.",4
76,"[REVIEW_1] terrible food and the manager was shockingly rude when I tried to return my food. I had the frogs legs and they were rubbery and tasted awful. I was disgusted by her behavior and she should be ashamed of herself. I have never been treated more horribly by someone. [REVIEW_2] i love sun tan city! the girls are always so nice. especially the manager. they're helpful; great saleswomen; and know what they're talking about. they don't just want your money but want to get to know you & help you as much as possible as you tan. i've been to several STC and this by far is my favorite just because of the cleanliness and customer service! if you're in nashville and need a tan - go here:) [REVIEW_3] Printed coupon off their web page just before going. Coupon was beyond its expiration date and they refused to honor it. They either need to fix their site or honor their coupons.  Not too nice about it; either. Need to find some other place where inept teenagers can do a mediocre job for a high price. Will definitely not return here. [REVIEW_4] I have eaten here several times during the four years I have lived in Philly; and have had happy hours or cocktail events here as well; as an employee of a company in the building; and I have had wonderful experiences. This is thanks completely to the *servers; bartenders; and kitchen staff*. On Valentine's Day; however; we had a very different experience. I am confident that the servers and kitchen staff were amazing as always; but we never found out. We made our reservation about a month and a half early; to ensure a window seat. OpenTable asked for a credit card when booking--no problem; we provided it. Upon arrival; we were told that; since we did not place a deposit; there was not a table for us. Yes; they could see our reservation in the system; they said; they can see the date on which we placed the reservation; a month and a half prior. However; they claim to have called us (one time) to get a deposit from us; and since they were unsuccessful; they didn't hold us a table (again; they can see our reservation; they knew we were coming).  **No one had ever called to obtain a deposit from us.**  Further; had they needed a deposit; that should have been worked out between OpenTable and R2L--not our problem. OpenTable asked for a credit card and we provided one. Plus; how incredibly rude is it to require a deposit for a table reservation anyway? As a semi-regular at this place I find that greatly offensive. We weren't speaking with hourly-waged youngsters either; we started with a manager and were escalated to ""one of the owners"". Neither woman made an attempt to be friendly; let alone apologetic or accommodating in any way.  This lady who was ""one of the owners"" should definitely keep herself exclusively in the back of the house; away from any sort of paying customer.  I have never; as a customer; been treated so poorly or talked to so terribly. And; no; I can assure you; we were not out of line or yelling or making a scene or rude for our part; we just aren't the type. She was plain awful.  Never so much as a shred of an inkling of a hint of an apology or any effort whatsoever.  So; despite all of the rave verbal reviews I have given everyone I know about this place in the past; I will now make sure that everyone we know; meet; work with; or do business with--several of whom work in that building--does not ever drink or dine at R2L.  And; clearly; we will never step foot into the place again either. After leaving; we had an amazing meal with mind-blowing service at DEVON SEAFOOD. Go there instead! [REVIEW_5] Awesome Vegan cafe! I can always expect a fast; quality lunch or dinner from here. I frequented HipCity as it is near where I had worked and the Philly Cheesesteak is delicious. I cannot recommend it enough; and many of my peers that I have brought to HipCity have continuously enjoyed their experience and the Cheesesteak as well. It is a messy meal; but so worth it. [REVIEW_6] This is the worst delivery experience I've ever had. I was a delivery driver for another Domino's for 5 years during college; so I know that things can get hectic; but this was ridiculous. Ordered online at 11:00pm; tracker said it would be delivered in 25-35 minutes. At 12:00am; the pizza had still not arrived so I called the store. They said mine was the next one out the door and should be there in a few minutes; because I live about 1 mile away from the store. At 1:00am; still no pizza. I call again and they said the driver left with my order and another order 30 minutes ago; and instead of driving to my house first; which was 1 MILE AWAY; he went to the other house first which was further away; and gave them their pizza AND MY PIZZA. They offered to make a new one and send it out; but I didn't want to wait up until 3 in the morning; so I said no thanks. They offered a free pizza on my next order; but that doesn't do anything to help me right now because it too late to order from anywhere else. This is why Uber Eats and other forms of food delivery will end up crushing stores like this. So to whoever runs this store; seriously; congratulations. You've just won the award for worst store in the franchise. [REVIEW_7] TL;DR: View/ambience: excellent; Food - Good (not great - honestly; if you're considering this place for the food; just go to Vernick); Service - extremely poor (why you're reading this review)  I'm not the type of person who regularly writes yelp reviews - I like most places where I eat and don't feel the need to write about it. That being said; because our experience at R2L was so anomalous; I felt I had to warn people about the service.   While the food was good; and the view was wonderful; we had an unfortunate experience. At the beginning of our meal; the waitress was friendly and built a rapport with us. However; there was an unfortunate incident where someone (not our server) on the waitstaff knocked a glass of water on one of us and spilled our bottle of wine on the floor. No wine got on either of us; and we were very understanding - mistakes happen. We get it. Here's where problems arose.   What great service would have been: Provide a glass of wine promptly to make up for the amount spilled and comp something trivial; like a desert or app.   What reasonable service would have been: Provide a glass of wine promptly to make up for the amount spilled.   What actually; unfortunately; happened: The waitstaff gave us a bunch of napkins and apologized a couple of times. One of about three people hurriedly cleaning us up promised us 2 extra glasses to make up for the wine that had soaked into the carpet. Finally; the gentleman who made the mistake was very apologetic. Up until this point - totally fine.   Then; after a few minutes of everyone; including our formerly-friendly server; avoiding us like they heard there was a sudden outbreak of the Zika virus at our table; our server finally resurfaced to refill water. When one of us asked whether that wine was coming out (after all; someone we hadn't met before promised it then disappeared); rather than reassuring us; this was the response; verbatim: ""You didn't finish the bottle yet. We were going to bring it out when you finished the bottle."" Excuse me?   After the flippant response; our waitstaff's avoidant behavior continued. We finished our bottle of wine with dinner; then ordered a dessert (hey; maybe this would give them a chance to be reminded by the wine stain in the carpet that they promised to compensate us for our overpriced loss with a glass?).  Frustrated; we asked for the check. After our waitress ran our card; FINALLY; upon returning our check; she poured our two drinks; without speaking a word to us; as we were about to leave.   We expected better from a such a supposedly classy establishment. We cannot in good conscience recommend this restaurant to others. [REVIEW_8] I went to Brio for the first time on Wednesday for dinner with my friend since a friend of us recommended it. Our first impression was ""Wow; this is a very nice restaurant."" The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. The servers are professional and very attentive. I treated myself an order of single Tuscan Grilled Porkchop with Roasted Garden Vegetables while my friend went straight for the Shrimp Mediterranean. My porkchop was incredibly moist and tender. There was a thin layer of crunchy fat wrapping about the piece of meat; which actually gave it more flavor and texture. The portion was reasonable so that I did not feel like I was stuffing myself but actually celebrated the food. We; however; did not have the chance to try out their dessert collection. I personally do not think this was a bad thing since it would give us an excuse to come back here for another time and enjoy the food. [REVIEW_9] I had my daughter's Sweet 16 there last night.  The atmosphere was amazing.  The food was delicious.  We had the Penne Alla Vodka; Chicken Fingers; French Fries (delish); Roast Beef and green beans. Everyone loved the food.  The manager Melissa was extremely attentive.  The Christmas decorations were beautiful.   We had looked at renting a banquet hall in Newtown Square and when I worked out the numbers it would have been $20 per kid and then I would have had to pay for the food and drinks. I highly recommend having an event there. [REVIEW_10] I have been going to the Children's Museum since I was a young boy and now take my young boys here. This place is amazing! As a child it was always exciting and to this day as an adult I look forward to and still get excited going here. For the price of admission you get your monies worth. There is usually a new exhibit to and they always seem to be expanding the museum in some way to! During Halloween they have their hunted house which is a blast and scary.  I highly recommended taking a class here if ever given the chance! They are always fun and a unique experience! [REVIEW_11] horrible. in Everyway. coffee and food taste horrible. horrible service too. Hat trick of horrible. NO STARS. [REVIEW_12] My wife recently attended an event here held by the UCSB Arts&Lectures program. The personnel and volunteers were very efficient and helpful; they communicated and worked very well with one another and with the public. The venue was clean and attractive. The event went smoothly; thanks to the great organizational skills of all involved. [REVIEW_13] This is my family's go to when we eat out for Chinese. The place is not big but it's decently modern. The quantity and the quality of their food are always good. Some items on the menu might be a little pricy; but most of the items off their menu are worth the money. One only improvement I can see is maybe they should hire a couple more staff during rush hours at dinner; food can come out a little late sometimes and the staff looks overwhelmed all the time; we've had the server forgetting a dish we ordered before because they were so busy. Nevertheless; this is a great spot and by far the best Chinese food restaurant in the area. [REVIEW_14] These people are so nice; as we came in a worker was cleaning the front door. The big man who made our food helped my son with his order. They had EXACTLY what my wife likes as they were able to improvise since she is rather ""high maintenance"" [REVIEW_15] It's surprising that you get as much food as you do for the low low cost that they charge.  I was hesitant to try my sandwich at first; thinking it must not be very good if it's that cheap.  I was Wrong!  This place serves some delicious sandwiches.  The only complaint I have is that they use bell peppers on almost everything and I'm allergic; but it's easy to order your sandwich without and so it is not a big deal.",9
77,"[REVIEW_1] Awesome ""Fresh"" ingredients; good service; and a solid menu. Can't go wrong; it's a great addition to SoHo. [REVIEW_2] The food was great; and our waitress was excellent . And her name was Oneal ask for her you can't go wrong. Thanks Zea [REVIEW_3] One of my very favorite places to eat.... Everything is always fresh and really tasty!  The staff is super friendly.  They make my favorite drink: almond milk; chai and vanilla.... So yummy; hot or iced!! [REVIEW_4] I just read through all of these reviews and giggled over everyone's unique opinion on what exactly the Goleta K-Mart smells like. My own instincts whisper to me ""cat pee."" And yes! a little sulphur (read that in someone else's review; thanks!) Having lived with cats all my life; it smells like home. This isn't a good thing.  It's almost impressive how bad the check-out is. You can find the shortest line; where there is one or no people in front of you; and it will STILL take you like 20 minutes to get through the line. The last time I went; my nail polish rang up as $82 for some weird fucking reason (probably because their computer system is from like 1983) and then the girl had to do the whole thing over again. The penultimate time I was here; I managed to get in a very short line only to have the lady in front of me decide to sign up for a Sears credit card (REALLY WHO DOES THIS SHIT) at the check-out. Which took an impressively long amount of time. Will I still come here to buy my hair dye? Sadly; yes; because it's like half the price of the grocery store. And lord help me if my natural hair color starts growing in.  Also; I seriously almost run someone over every time I try to park. Not in anger; but just because it seems like the elderly like to hide behind cars and then jump into my view at the last second. It's almost like a conspiracy. hmmm....  well; here's hoping someone finally finds the courage to blow the motherfucker up one day. [REVIEW_5] We like the food here very much. Even the house salad is super fresh and delicious. The soups are tasty and full of good spices; vegetables and if desired meat or fish. I've had the Tom Yum with Seafood #51 and it is consistently awesome. You probably have to enjoy Thai cuisine or be open to experimenting to get the most from a visit to Tin's.  If you are into really good Thai food this is a great place to visit. [REVIEW_6] Over my 68 years; I have eaten a lot of pralines. Some delicious; some not so much. But I can say with absolute certainty; that they make the best praline I have ever had. They aren't cheap; but they are worth every penny. I'm just glad I live 70 miles away; or I would go there all too often! [REVIEW_7] Stay away from this dealership.  I have wrote about 3 different reviews on their site and I keep giving them one more chance but wont anymore.  My whole family drives Hyundai but constantly they find ways to screw you over. [REVIEW_8] this was so worth it.  first; what an awesome innovation - the mini-scoop sampler!  i can never decide what to get; and this time i got to choose FOUR flavors!  i got the chocolate; lavendar honey; coffee butter pecan; and the pumpkin cheesecake.  the butter pecan was in a league of its own; but closely followed by the honey.  not only were these flavorful; but all four were perfectly dense creaminess.  it's a good thing i don't leave near the place. [REVIEW_9] Great selection of steaks and perhaps the best shrimp cocktail on the planet! [REVIEW_10] Excellent service; excellent food!!! This was my first time at the Collingswood location. I have frequented the Philadelphia locations several times. This location is; by far; my favorite. It's spacious which is different than the other locations. Our server was super friendly and even brought a bowl of boiling hot water so that I could warm my daughter's bottle. We will definitely returning in the near future. [REVIEW_11] Great experience; fast friendly and efficient! They do what they say. Worth the drive from Tampa!!! I have a bump or bruise on my credit; single digit interest and respect from the dealer!! [REVIEW_12] I have used ""vrbo"" and home away websites for a longtime. This is the worst experience I have ever had with a site. My friends and I were trying to book a place for the Essence Festival in July. We knew how the housing would be an issue so we started looking for a place to stay at the end of Feb. We saw the French Quarter Suites offered Town homes; they looked nice; so we began to inquire. The process is usually pretty easy but working with Ms. Leslie was not. When asking questions about a 5br town home she would often skirt the questions and not give direct answers. She raised the prices on our stay; without our knowledge and refused to breakdown the price of our payment.  The pay for parking was never mentioned; and the we had to inquire why the invoice stated the town home was a one room annex NOT a 5 bedroom town house. The Frech Quarter Suites Hotel website and business are misleading and dishonest. [REVIEW_13] Don't go here during late night. Fast food resteraunts in the city love to not give a shit at 2:00am and not take your order even though their open 24/hrs. Terrible. [REVIEW_14] I ate at the Denny at the corner of oracle and river rd in Tucson; I ordered some grits and side order of sausage; and 3 eggs; that was the Nastiest meal I have ever had; that's a shame because the people that worked there was kind and helpful; but the food was terrible; the grits was dry and hard and not done; the sausage tasted like meatless sausage and boiled; the eggs tasted like they had been cooked hours ago. The 1 Star is for the kind people that waited on me. [REVIEW_15] We were happy to discover Luke thanks to the concierge at the Hilton that recommended it. We were hesitant to try it since it was adjacent to the hotel. Shame on us. We quickly discovered that celebrate chef John Besh ran the place and it truly was hopping. Our first visit was for happy hour shortly after we landed in New Orleans. Half price oysters and drinks; you can't go wrong. We quickly reordered another dozen as they were fresh and the sauces ere great. The sazerac was delicious.They have a nice wine and beer list too. We didn't originally order the fries but the table next to us were enjoying them and they looked so good; we had to try. We weren't disappointed. We liked Luke so much that we went back for Christmas day brunch. Equally good. Note that you really need a reservation at any time of the day. It's always busy. They say that you can wait and sit at the bar but it's packed too. If you call and they say that they are fully booked; try opentable; it seems like there are tables hidden away and available.",10
78,"[REVIEW_1] Who knew I would lives grocery store so much! I've been to a few publix grocery stores before but this one is by far the best one! They have an awesome deli section that has a wide selection of everything! I love that they have 10+ different types of hummus! What grocery store gives you that much variety? Exactly no other LOL! But there's also a ton of different salads; chicken salads; potatoe salads; salsa; etc...just so much! I love this store [REVIEW_2] I was excited to try this place. Decided to meet a friend for a late lunch. The C House says they open at 2:00 in Saturday's. They were open. We ordered. Waited 15 minutes then the waiter appeared saying they were not prepared to serve food. They weren't ready at 3:00 either. No manager came by. Nothing. We left. Total disappointment. Don't open at 2:00 if you can't serve food. Ridiculous. [REVIEW_3] There are so many good places in New Hope but unfortunately for me; this isn't one of them.  My family ordered 4 entrees and nine were particularly good.  My French dip had almost no meat and was old.  For $18; i expert to be full...not  need to eat again in 10 minutes.  To top off the marginal food; it took almost 40 minutes to come once we ordered it.   Do yourself a favor and choose about place...you'll be much happier. [REVIEW_4] Absolutely horrible service; cold soup and my salad was drenched in dressing. The iceberg lettece was browning; soggy and pickled.  This place should not even get 1 star. [REVIEW_5] Not really the town you would expect to find a great Indian restaurant; but figured I'd give it a shot. I'm picky about Indian food; and all I can say is WOW it's good! The Naan with peach chutney was amazing. The Lamb Korma was perfect. Perfect amount of spice (too many Indian restaurant set your mouth on fire and you can't enjoy the taste). Not too much; not too little. The rice and lamb was perfectly cooked. Very authentic.  The decor is very nice (those chairs in the front are impressive) and staff very friendly. Service was also very quick.  I'm relocating to Tampa; and might actually have to make the drive from there a few times to come back. Very impressive!  I would definitely recommend this place; even if it's a bit of a drive.  It's worth it. [REVIEW_6] Fantastic restaurant located in the the heart of Jacksons square! The ambience was very classy. A bit pricey but; worth the experience. We opted for the pre-fixed menu; which included an appetizer; entree with about 5 different options and a desert. After dinner we took a trip upstairs where it is very eclectic. Although there is no food or beverage service on the patio; you can order a cocktail down stairs; and enjoy it on the patio over looking Jackson Square! [REVIEW_7] I stayed here the night before my wedding with a few of my bridesmaids and the next two nights with my brand-new husband.  We stayed in the Santa Rosa cottage and it was amazing!  The room was spectacular; tons of room; the most comfortable bed EVER; and fantastic whirlpool bath and double shower.  The staff was wonderful; especially the front desk clerk (Karen? I think...cute blond woman; super helpful).  We had a complimentary basket of snacks in our room; which was wonderful when my girls and I were getting ready the day of the wedding.  The room was so beautiful and I loved the balcony...I know that our pictures will be terrific. I will always have so many good memories of this hotel and will definitely end up going back! [REVIEW_8] This spa delivers. The atmosphere here is PERFECT. Calming and fancy--I felt like a princess there. It's very clean and the masseuses are quite good. Just make sure to speak up if they start pushing too hard during a massage! It's so tranquil there. I want to go back one day! [REVIEW_9] DONT GO HERE. Go to literally any other car wash. They take fine care of your car but both times I went something went missing from my car. Most recently a necklace of mine broke earlier in the day and I put it in my cup holder and it was gone after they finished with it. I called immediately after I left and no one got back to me. I've called three times since then and went in two days later. No one was even there when I went in. I waited for 20 minutes and no one showed up. It was just me and some other customers. The only assumption I can have is that someone working on my car stole my things out of it. [REVIEW_10] After always shopping at the Randall's off Jefferson; it was nice to see West County get their own Randall's. Staff here is uber friendly and helpful. Beer selection is solid here; with plenty of styles to choose from.Prices are competitive with the other beer markets around. Well worth your time and money. [REVIEW_11] The best coffee in town. Makes it hard to go back to SB ever again. I'm a Frappe fan but also love the hots and have never been disappointed by the quality. They even know what we like and will have my husband's ready before he reaches the window! [REVIEW_12] The best Japanese restaurant! Stumbled upon this with my family and gave it a try... Dinner and a show! I saw tricks I haven't seen in any Japanese restaurant before! And every single food dish was phenomenal. If only I lived in SB! I'd be here every night! [REVIEW_13] I have new dental insurance and had to find a dentist in network and came across Music City Dental. Dr. Spurlin and her staff are great! They are very gentle and make sure the patient is comfortable at all times. I had to get a filling and am terrified of shots. I didn't even feel when Dr. Spurlin gave me my shot. I was offered a pillow; blanket and choice of watching a movie or listening to music. I had a pleasant experience and am definitely a permanent patient! [REVIEW_14] Worst concert experience I've had. Buyers; beware. They're only interested in your money NOT your experience. My husband spent A LOT of money on an Imagine Dragons VIP package and it left much to be desired. The ""gift bag"" was filled with a small; cheap crumpled poster; plastic sunglasses; a pop socket; and a phone charger fit for a circa 2015 android. The ""crowd free shopping"" consisted of about 200 people crammed in a small area with general admission goers; and the ""hassle free entry"" took 45 minute. So; all in all I sit here really pissed about the experience; feeling bad for my husband who wanted to surprise; and the concert hasn't even started yet. Bravo CID. Thank you for seriously putting a damper on my night. [REVIEW_15] 0 Stars for customer service would be appropriate. The disaster they created for my daughter's confirmation cannot be put in words. Everybody is entitled to make mistakes even big ones it's how they handle them.  Allow me to describe the situation. It all started when we receive the Box minutes before our luncheon with somebody else's name on it. The cake didn't fit in the box so we walked across town with an open box.  When we open the Box it had our daughter's name on it however it looked like it was written by a first grader. None of the requested decorations including the Holy Cross and others were not included which was the purpose of the cake. The top it off the cake was  completely dry would have been better off with a cake from acme. The cake was loaded with these plastic sticks and I'm unsure why we counted over 40 of them; making it impossible to cut. We attempted to call master Baker several times and they were not open finally 2 weeks after the event were able to get ahold to somebody who could actually care less......"" said thank you for the learning experience we will discuss it are a next meeting."" That's it No desire to disgusted details and all they did was criticize us for waiting so long to get back to them when in fact they were never open when we called. We had photograph evidence of what they provided us still unwilling to listen.  Well Chad I can't believe you would treat customers like we were treated.",9
79,[REVIEW_1] This place deserves 5 STARS.  It was such a great place to eat at a French style bakery; drink one of the best cups of coffee I've ever had and relax. I would highly recommend this little spot. Great choice. We'll be back! [REVIEW_2] Best pizza in town! fresh ingredients. a little on the pricey side but well worth it.  delivery and pickup only.  the white pizza and thai chicken are my favorite. [REVIEW_3] Great concept; perfect atmosphere; even better food.  What looks like a small corner store in Bywater opens up to a large courtyard in back with tables and torches strewn about seemingly haphazardly; like a friend might put together for a party on a Saturday night.   A stage in back houses an assortment of bands; and from my singular experience I will say the quality of music is exceptional. We saw a great jazz trio followed by a funk trio of organ/guitar/drums that was so good... Shout out to the drummer who had my jaw on the table all night. So tight and sublime.   To get to the courtyard you pass through the corner store full of wine; find a bottle that suits you; maybe some cheese or charcuterie; then head out back to find a table and park for a bit.  The food was better than either of our meals the previous two nights; and at half the price.   I had pork shoulder (in a broth born for sopping with good French bread); but honestly the chicken confit was the best plate of food I've tasted in a long time.   Olive oil cake is worth a taste for dessert.  Little cold this week so the heaters were out; which was great; but I'm looking forward to a warm sultry night here sometime in the near future! [REVIEW_4] Been here about 4 times so far and haven't had a bad meal yet. Awesome cocktails and friendly service. Being so new; they could use a bit more ambiance such as art on the walls but I suspect good things to come because the food is fantastic. We're excited to have this food option on the east side! [REVIEW_5] At long last! I don't have to drive to the southside of Tucson for authentic Mexican food. Great service; decent menu &  definitely worth a visit. [REVIEW_6] Only had one experience with this place and it will be my last. I called in the night before to ask if they sell deboned duck and the man on the phone said they could but I would have to request it the day of. I called the following morning to ask to pick up a plain deboned duck and whoever the incompetent girl who answered had trouble getting my order clear. I picked up my order and came home to find that not only did they gave a whole duck with stuffing I never asked for. I called the place back and thy never offered any compensation of any sort except a trade in right as it's a hour before dinner time and the butcher shop is more than thirty minutes away for me. Shame that food from this place is overshadowed by their terrible customer service. [REVIEW_7] Place was incredibly delicious and fresh and comfy! We came in for a water and ended up with 3 sandwiches an apple fritter and 2 cheesecakes! Best cafe I've found in New Orleans :) [REVIEW_8] Great place.; friendly staff and great working hours. Snow; rain or any kind of weather; stories opened on time. I love their egg and croissant sandwich and of course; it is Dunkin brands.  Place is kept well and sometime they treat their customer well by giving free donuts and munchkins. [REVIEW_9] I ordered food to be delivered and this place gets top rating! My order was delivered in less time that was quoted. I ordered the Antipasto salad and it was the most fresh and best I've ever had! ordered penne ala vodka dish but liked it better with fettuccini! Thanks Matt; but please don't forget plastic silverware next time. [REVIEW_10] I love this place. Best sushi in Tampa. The staff is always friendly and dies a great job. I've never had a bad experience here. You can sit at the bar and watch them create your meal or a table. They have free WiFi so you can make it a working meal.  They do deliver which is another bonus.  I've had them deliver several times and the online system is a little clunky and one time we had a rude experience when the driver couldn't figure out how our condo gate worked. [REVIEW_11] Do NOT use this auto service center! They will tell you one thing on the phone; and when you drive all the way there to get service on your car; they will tell you that they can't have your vehicle done for hours longer than promised over the phone. I recently tried to get my oil changed here; I called first to see if they took reservations and was told that they were walk-in only but if I had my car there by 3:30pm they would have it done by 5:30pm at the latest. So I drove 30 minutes to get there; planning to do some shopping and errands at the surrounding stores while I waited. However when I arrived; the service guys told me they couldn't get it done before 8!!! When I explained that I had called and was told no more than two hours; even showing them my phone to prove I called the right Dobbs; the desk guy basically called me a liar and said no one told me that they could have it done in two hours! Now THATS customer service if I've ever heard it. Needless to say I took my keys and left. I will never bring my business to Dobbs again. [REVIEW_12] I have had many MANY massage experiences in my life no this is absolutely the top of the line! Freedom massage is the best place to get a rub down! This place is very clean; zen; down to earth and relaxing. The owner knows her stuff and goes the extra 10 miles to make sure everyone has a fabulous experience. From the hand painted thoughtful art on the walls to the divine music to the very talented masseuses; this place completely rocks the entire massage experience! If you have the opportunity make sure to stop by here for an experience of a lifetime. [REVIEW_13] This place is so cute. The interior is adorable and casual. There's some small booths and chairs and tables for hanging out and enjoying your food/drinks. It's all so clean; too; which is a huge plus. There's a little section with baked goods; some Asian and some more American. They have mostly Vietnamese food; but I also saw some other types of food (e.g bulgogi). I came in with two friends and the woman who helped us was really personable and friendly. We ordered banh mi and boba tea; and sat down waiting for our food to be brought to us. The banh mi was really yummy; especially the bread. I had boba milk tea; which was as good as any milk tea I've had before.  They have a drink card which you can get stamped to receive a free tenth drink. Definitely an incentive to return. Also; their hours are awesome; which is a huge plus. [REVIEW_14] Wonderful establishment with a great selection of always super fresh seafood.  Their in season soft shell crabs are melt in your mouth good.  Hands down the best local fish monger in Bucks County; well worth the drive to Buckingham. [REVIEW_15] Try the Green Bloody Mary!  Creative twist on a classic. Got a delayed kick; but it's a good one.,13
80,"[REVIEW_1] This was so disappointing. I love Chick fil A. My son even works at the Avon location; which is fabulous. This is not the same. I tried to order my usual; that I get several times a week in Avon; and they received to accommodate. I only wanted the bread from the mini rolls. Go to Avon; very close and such a wonderful place to eat. [REVIEW_2] My fianc√© and I went to Spraga last night..needless to say it was our first and last time dining at this establishment.  We were pretty pumped to go here since we live right down the street and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at Fat Ham a few weeks ago.  The food was good but not show stopping.  My major issues were with the service.  1 word.  Unbelievable.  We spent $180 on 2 people.  When you spend that much money on a meal.. You expect perfection with food; service and ambiance.  This place underwhelmed and now I have to deal with my fianc√© who is still raging with last nights experience.  Thanks Spraga.  Issues: 1.  Soups came before cocktails.  I finally had to ask a manager where our cocktails we're because it so long.  - not in my world if I'm paying $180!   2.  First course came while we were still eating our soup..so we had 2 plates in front of us on a cramped table.  Hello serving 101 at like the most basic restaurant in the world..Don't bring the next course when people are still eating their first!  Again I would expect shit like this to happen if I were at TGI Fridays but I wasn't at TGI Fridays.  I was at SPRAGA. 4. The waiter tried to remove plates while we were still eating from them.  Say what?  Not when I'm paying $180 on a meal son!  You leave the plate until I am finished! 5.  The waiter would awkwardly come to the table and just stand there.. Obviously we know he came to take our food order or dessert order but you say "" Is everyone ready?.. I'd like to take your order"" etc.  WTF.  Nope he just stood there... Weird!   6.  Empty glasses/butter dishes left on the table throughout the meal.  Sloppy.  The server tries to take plates we are still eating from but leaves sangria glasses etc for the entire meal?  I just.  Don't.  Get it.    All in all food was good; not amazing and I've had better service at Tangier.  If you are going to spend that much money go somewhere else. [REVIEW_3] I been to a lot of places but this place was gross. I am sorry to say but there was hair in my good and the waitress was rude. [REVIEW_4] I could just copy and paste the majority of the reviews into this box; but I guess I will share my experience first hand.  At first; I thought it was a farmers market. I texted my friend asking her what time we should go so I knew when to cook dinner and she told me to hold off dinner - I was going to get stuffed at this event.  She was dead wrong.  When we arrived around 7:30 we found it super packed. Long long times; tight crowds; lots of dogs and babies. We circled the event trying to pick out which line we were going to devote our entire night to standing in; and decided on the Jamaican truck. After an hour of standing in line; and having other line go-ers friends casually jip us; we finally made it to the front to order only to have the vendor announce they were out of all of my meal options.  So you know what I had for dinner the evening of Night Market? A bag of chips from CVS.  This event had it's potential. But I guess they were not counting on the ridiculous horde of hungry people. Most trucks were placing ""SOLD OUT"" signs just as we were arriving. There were very few vegetarian/vegan options... (actually; don't believe any food vendors had vegan options). Hopefully next time they will be able to work out their kinks. [REVIEW_5] In the last month I have taken both our vehicles to the Jiffy Lube on Los Altos in Sparks;NV. Both times I was met promptly at my vehicle by a friendly employee! The staff was helpful and knowledgeable   In getting me the service my vehicles needed. The work was done efficiently and with precision. I would definitely recommend their service to others! [REVIEW_6] Horrible horrible horrible experience. We have been residents of Santa Barbara for over 20 years. We own a small local business and two rental properties. Both the staff and owner are unprofessional and offer subpar work. They subcontract their jobs and don't have a foreman or supervisor present for the day of the job to assist in communication with us. All the workers just stand there and stare at you when you are asking any questions about installation and then tell you to call the office to speak to someone else! It was; honestly; amazingly unorganized. Very disappointed with the quality of the product; the warranty and the treatment by the owner and staff. Furniture was damaged and broken the day of the installation and never repaired.  Baseboards were not installed even though they were included in the price quote. Now less than a year later we are forced to replace the floors. Tried to follow up and resolve this directly and all they do is make excuses and lie. I would have rather gone to a big box store than have deal with these clowns. [REVIEW_7] I have visited this establishment over the years and can only say it continues a downward slide to depths of mediocrity I thought unattainable for a business to remain open.  I stopped in again today solely because the usual Saturday performer was not playing. His replacement was a welcome change from the overly affected ridiculous twang rendition of every song played by the usual performer.  Equally welcome was the absence of his asinine and drunken ""roadie"" riding his non existent coat tails and harassing the staff. Laughably billed as an Idol and Voice contestant who has yet to make it past round one of local auditions.  As for Kelly Days; beyond disappointing! If someone can explain the economics behind a 12 oz draft of costing 4.25 and a 16 oz can of the same brand  costing only 3.25 I will nominate you for the Nobel Prize in economics.   Not sure why the previous manager; Jay; left but I wish him the best. The current staff and management falls just short of oblivious which combined with their unique brand of indifference and incompetence leaves one wondering how the doors stay open. Did I try the food? Heavens no! Not making that mistake again or the aforementioned ever again! [REVIEW_8] Excellent service; excellent food!!! This was my first time at the Collingswood location. I have frequented the Philadelphia locations several times. This location is; by far; my favorite. It's spacious which is different than the other locations. Our server was super friendly and even brought a bowl of boiling hot water so that I could warm my daughter's bottle. We will definitely returning in the near future. [REVIEW_9] Horrible customer service.  Customers should be allowed to try on another size.  The sales associate actually refused to get me another size; which is not what I have experienced at other stores.  I wasn't asking for anything out of the ordinary; I only took in 2 bras and wanted ONE of them in a different size.  The store wasn't busy so I don't understand her reluctance. You can give me advice on how it should fit; but don't make me stand there peeking out of the fitting room doorway; half dressed; trying to justify why I just want to *try* the next size up.  I know how I want my lingerie to fit and will go elsewhere where I won't be put in such a humiliating situation. [REVIEW_10] Whatever you do avoid the asian lady (sorry i do not know her nationality) with grey salt n pepper hair AT ALL COSTS. Her work is substandard (ie i had to file my own nails to correct her shape; clean under my nails; adjust the stones on my nails). You show a design; she says okay then starts and tells you she doesnt have the materials. There was a void in my nail and she kept telling me it wasnt there and then proceeded to ""buff"" it out. I had to tell her twice to fix it. I paid im full; but will definitely watch my credit card statement for extra charges. My friend's nails came out great (she had one of the male nail techs). I can fix mine at home; I'll NEVER go back. Beware!!! [REVIEW_11] This is my favorite taco place in Tucson. It has delicious vegetarian options and the price is hard to beat. They have excellent salsa options and you get complimentary chips. The only issue is that parking is difficult to find; but that's expected with any restaurant in downtown. [REVIEW_12] Two days here at the Eldorado with a group of 25 people. We have experienced the worse customer service . We just finished brunch and we're constantly badgered by our waitress about the number of people in our group. We were taking up too much space. She was a nice as a rattlesnake.  At 17 dollars per person I would think more is better. Food was ok but you will definitely not be welcomed or appreciated.   Yesterday same warm fuzzy feeling at the coffee shop when we spent over 350 dollars and we're treated like castaways.  TAKE YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE. .. NO HOSPITALITY AT ELDORADO [REVIEW_13] Great sushi place. it's on the pricey side of the sushi; but the taste is phenomenal. the best pick is the baked Philadelphia roll. Come and enjoy :) [REVIEW_14] Echoing everyone else's frustration about Philly's 2013 ""race"" - expensive parking; storm came; chaos ensued and we never got refunds! It was actually a dangerous situation; with thousands of people running around a park at night in thunder and lightening; and they never came back to Philly... [REVIEW_15] I will never eat there again. I ordered chicken Parmesan and after about four bites I realized my chicken was raw!  The manager Gary  said this hardly ever happens. What? Like it was a common occurrence. This place will never last. I ignored a good friends advice saying he had a bad meal there. Next time I will listen.",4
81,"[REVIEW_1] My boyfriend and I went here because he needed stitches;let's start with the lovely woman at the front desk..rude and unprofessional! Cocky as ever; sitting there playing on her phone smh sat there forever due to them being under staffed. Then the doctor tells us he can just glue it;leaves for 2 more hours!!!-they forgot us..I was going to flip out while seeing people just sitting around; I decided to blast my Pandora and in runs the doctor; blames the nurse for the wait;and has my bf assist him in applying the liquid stitch smdh unbelievable. Never again...DO NOT GO HERE - GO TO FRANKFORD FRANKFORD!! [REVIEW_2] Severely over charged for 2 sno-balls & my order was wrong. $8 for an 8oz with gummy bears and a 20oz with condensed milk? Puh-lease. My 20oz was supposed to be stuffed but I didn't know it wasn't stuffed until after digging in! Booooooo [REVIEW_3] My boyfriend and I arrived at Don Pablo's at 5:45 on Saturday night. We were told the wait was 30 minutes- awesome. After 45 minutes passed; we checked in with the hostess again. "" Oh; you had a faulty buzzer"". No apology; no coming to find us; nothing. The manager took us to our table; again no apology- just explained that this happens a lot.  After being seated; our server came 15 minutes later for our drink order. No introduction; just ""What do you want to drink."" After ordering a margarita and beer; we waited another 10 minutes for our drinks to arrive.  I regret our appetizer of flauetas or whatever they are called. Frozen taquitos that were rock hard when they arrived at my table. After the appetizer; it took 35 minutes for our entrees to reach the table. My boyfriends was cold and mine was incorrect. After already being in this restaurant for over 2 hours; we had enough. The waiter saw we were frustrated and took one meal off the bill. Terrible service; terrible food; terrible management. First and last visit for us! [REVIEW_4] I don't know if you can see it from the pic I uploaded but there's sauce covered straws; hair; crumbs and red soda all over the table they sat us at. I asked the waitress to clean it up. She wouldn't. We left before getting our food. Super gross. [REVIEW_5] We never bothered going because the staff was so rude when we called to ask a few questions that we wound up hanging up on them. [REVIEW_6] Wouldn't go here again..... I got my belly button pierced...first off it was pierced crooked; secondly the artist was making really Inappropriate jokes the whole time... Not to mention the fact that he told me about one girl who he pierced who thought the pain was so bad she fainted...Like that's not something you should be talking to customers about as they are about to get their piercing.....NOT COOL! I also hated the fact that he bad mouthed other shops and tried saying that he was the best piercer ever because he's been doing it for this long and blah blah blah.... Sorry buddy but if you were the best my piercing wouldnt have been crooked...wouldn't recommend [REVIEW_7] We made reservations; and were seated upstairs about a foot from the band at a table that seemed more like a bar table. After sitting for 45 min with NO SERVICE; just empty glasses and silverware; we left. While leaving the host kindly insisted to grab the manager after we told her what happened. (The hosts were wonderful!)   The manager did nothing besides essentially say that this wasn't typical and to come back. [REVIEW_8] This place was awful. I really like Mexican food; but this place is so not Mexican food. My hubby and I went for dinner on a Tues. It was busy for a Tues. so we were excited. We were seated quickly and our server gave us our drinks quickly; but it was a downturn after that. First the chips and salsa were tasteless; I have found better tasting salsa from jar salsa at the grocery store. Also we waited for ridiculous 45 minutes for our food to come out. All we ordered was tacos; a burrito; and one chicken enchilada. Simple freaking meals...I mean come on that should take 10 minutes. After the server gave us our food finally...he never came back to check if we needed anything else. We could not even flag anyone to refill our waters. The burrito and tacos were very bland but edible. The chicken enchilada was the worst enchilada I have ever had. I couldn't even eat it. The red sauce on it tasted like some old can enchilada sauce that has been sitting in their kitchen for awhile. After we were done eating we sat there for another 15 minutes before the server came to our table. I told him I didn't like the enchilada and he did take it off the check; but that doesn't make up for one of the worst service from a restaurant that I have experienced. We won't be back. Good luck Poblanos. [REVIEW_9] This place was awful. I went because it was the only place open late at night. Burger and fries were horrible and I got an apple pie which tasted like it came out of a refrigerated box. [REVIEW_10] I could just copy and paste the majority of the reviews into this box; but I guess I will share my experience first hand.  At first; I thought it was a farmers market. I texted my friend asking her what time we should go so I knew when to cook dinner and she told me to hold off dinner - I was going to get stuffed at this event.  She was dead wrong.  When we arrived around 7:30 we found it super packed. Long long times; tight crowds; lots of dogs and babies. We circled the event trying to pick out which line we were going to devote our entire night to standing in; and decided on the Jamaican truck. After an hour of standing in line; and having other line go-ers friends casually jip us; we finally made it to the front to order only to have the vendor announce they were out of all of my meal options.  So you know what I had for dinner the evening of Night Market? A bag of chips from CVS.  This event had it's potential. But I guess they were not counting on the ridiculous horde of hungry people. Most trucks were placing ""SOLD OUT"" signs just as we were arriving. There were very few vegetarian/vegan options... (actually; don't believe any food vendors had vegan options). Hopefully next time they will be able to work out their kinks. [REVIEW_11] Went to Winco to purchase my weeks worth of groceries; It was about 6pm on a weekday. Spent about 45 minutes to an hour picking out my items; stood in a long line for about 20 minutes; when I got to the front of the line the cashier turned off her light and said I'm closed but were opening another check stand one over. Everyone that was behind me ran to the new checkstand and I was left in the back of the line for a 2nd time. Now it took 40 minutes to check out instead of 20. When I got home my ice cream was all melted. If this happens again I will walk out and let them put the groceries away. [REVIEW_12] Visited on 12/16/14 We have tried this restaurant location under various management.  So when we saw it was open once again; under a new name we wanted to give it a chance.  We will not be going back.  We did get carry out; so we gave some slack on the mushy; greasy onion rings; and the Texas toast.  But my husband ordered the brisket and rib platter and I ordered the 1/2 chicken.  The ribs were just ok; the brisket was an end piece and was burned and inedible.  The chicken was more the size of a Cornish game hen and had little meat.  They gave 2 small containers of BBQ sauce which was not enough.  We both asked for cole slaw; but got potato salad.  The cowboy beans were watery.    It is one of the closest restaurants to us; so we wanted it to be good; but we will not be returning. [REVIEW_13] OK.. I want to make it clear I am only talking about this Moxie's location.. We eat at the other two; and they are awesome. We did decide to try this one. We walked into the tiny restaurant portion; and it wreaked of cigarette smoke. We looked over to the right and noticed a glass door that opened into a bar where people were obviously smoking. We turned around a walked out. If the owners of Moxie's are reading this; if you are going to have a smokey bar; please make sure that there is no way the smoke can get into the restaurant. [REVIEW_14] Service was so poor we didn't even get to the food. New Years Day 2017 around 7:30 and we get seated. It's 8:15 now and we still don't have water and multiple waiters have introduced themselves to us saying they're going to be our server for the evening. After wasting 45 mins and repeated attempts to get water for the largest party in the small restaurant we walked out and went across the street to Dat Dog and were blown away by hot dogs. Thanks Dat Dogs! [REVIEW_15] Worst restaurant experience ever. First; this place is super cramped! The noise level was atrocious. I don't know why they haven't done anything about this. We could not engage in an enjoyable conversation.  Second; my plate had dried up food on it from the previous guest. I understand that can happen. But nevertheless; yuck! The service was mediocre. Third; the food was loaded with salt. My husband has high blood pressure so this was a major concern to me. I took a few bites but didn't finish and definitely didn't bother to take home. You cannot enjoy the flavor of the food because everything was drowning in salt. Gross. Fourth; our bill was extremely high. This food was definitely over priced for the quality.  The dessert was decent. But the thing that put the final nail in their restaurant coffin; was the Roach that grazed over my high heel on my way out. I wanted to die. Never again!!!!! Don't waste your time or your money and they seriously need to hire an exterminator now!!!!!!",0
82,"[REVIEW_1] Best auto repair shop in the area. I go to no other shop for maintenance or repairs. I send my friends and people I don't care for to west county auto repair because I believe that Everyone deserved the best and that is WEST COUNTY AUTO SERVICE      ASK FOR ROB OR RON [REVIEW_2] I recently moved to the STL area from Denver and have tried several different teachers -- I can say that Danielle; the owner of D's; is far and away my favorite.  Danielle has a wonderful understanding of alignment and sequencing. Her verbal cues were clear and I felt like I learned a lot during just one class. I really appreciated that she did a lot of hands on adjustments because it kept me feeling safe in the poses. Her transitions between poses and sets were really creative and kept me engaged.    Overall; I walked away feeling sweaty and sore in a good way. All the students in the class seemed really comfortable with her and she made an effort to talk to me as a new student. I will definitely be back and look forward to her classes. [REVIEW_3] We stopped in while exploring Tarpon Springs for the first time. We were seated immediately even though the restaurant was bustling. Our server; Soula; was very personable and gave us her genuine opinion when we asked. I ordered the Greek Style Scallops and they were very good. My friend ordered the combination plate which was really good if you have not had Greek food and want to try multiple things. [REVIEW_4] Let me start out by saying that I am a nut for good sushi. Out of probably 200 sushi bars I have been to; there are only 9 places in the world that I have been to that meet my criteria to be called a ""good"" sushi bar. Three are in Japan; 2 are in Los Angeles; 1 is in San Francisco; 2 are in New York; and then there's this place in sh*tty old Philadelphia; a 5 minute cab ride from my apartment in Center city. Izumi is nothing short of excellent in every way. Any good food starts out with good ingredients. Making good traditional sushi is very simple: use good quality rice; prepared properly; excellent fish; and a dab of some good home-made ""wasabi"". Most places suck at all or some of these things. Not this place. Small restaurant with maybe 4 staffers including one in the front-of-house. Hardest working people in the restaurant industry; those FOH guys. Probably only 30-35 seats; but when the place is full; they are running around like crazy; serving food; taking orders; busing tables; and seating new parties. The wait can be long; but it is worth it. All of the fish I have had there (virtually every fish on the menu) has been perfect as sashimi and sushi; and their maki rolls are good as well. Special shout-outs for the tuna; salmon; super-white tuna (don't eat too much because of high wax content and digestive issues); and the oh toro. All are excellent in texture; quality; taste; and preparation. If you like spicy tuna rolls; you won't eat them again at your local neighborhood sushi joint. Each order is prepared individually from a filet of tuna scraped with a spoon. There's no giant tub of tuna scraps in the back mixed with mayo and a little sririacha served all day.   The good food doesn't stop at the sushi; though. Their slow roasted beef shortrib is nothing short of ""oh-my-goodness this is amazing"".  We first visited Izumi by accident about 2 or 3 months ago; and now find ourselves there once a week. It's that good. [REVIEW_5] Precision pizza pie! The dough is soft and flaky with a rich buttery taste and the sweet sauce is good with the pepperoni! I always order two! [REVIEW_6] My fiance and I come here pretty regularly as we live right down the road. We've always had good experiences. The servers are nice; the food is good and it's served pretty quickly. There are better Mexican restaurants in Indy; but this is one of the better in Avon/Brownsburg area. [REVIEW_7] I truly enjoyed the atmosphere; the service (Connor) and my dinner meal. I had the cakes for an appetizer; a cup of barley soup and the shrimp ravioli. Malbec glass of wine was perfect. First time here. Thrilled to know they serve breakfast; lunch and dinner!  Highly recommend. I will most certainly be back. [REVIEW_8] TNT shrimp and the conch fritters were to die for. The lobster roll was really good. The appearance on the outside is a little iffy but it's a hidden gem on the inside :). Will definitely be back! [REVIEW_9] Great selection of local authors; classics; fiction; and non-fiction. Prices are of course more than the Internet; but it is not a chain store either; it is so much better experience than that!!!  It is a great place for writers and readers alike to enjoy!   Highly recommended! [REVIEW_10] Love it love it love it!!! I finally got to try the barrel for the first time! We got the sample for $12 and I also got Pinot noir an for was pretty good as usual! They have life music (first Friday) and the atmosphere is very nice and relaxing! So glad this place is in phoenixville! [REVIEW_11] I grabbed breakfast with a friend early one Saturday morning and Henry's was such a delightful little nook. We were greeted warmly and had a nice long chat with the barista. The food was exceptional and was just the right amount of food; not too much or too little. This place is where you want to be on a slow weekend morning. [REVIEW_12] Needed a battery for my Lexus.  Drove over to AutoZone in Roxborough at 9 am Sunday morning.  Easy transaction; had the new battery installed within minutes!  Thank you for getting my car back on the road again! [REVIEW_13] I have driven by this place many times and today I stopped.  Holy Moly am I glad I did.  I had 2 tacos. Tacos de Puerco con salsa verde.  This is a slow braised pork tossed in the house made salsa Verde. (yes I copied the menu).....WOW was this delicious.  I had practically sworn off carnitas because they are usually so bland. This was full of flavor. 1 taco was not enough. The salsa verde was also amazing.  I also had the Habanero taco de pescado.  You can choose grilled or beer battered fish. (I chose beer battered)  This was probably the best fish taco I have ever had. The fish was flavorful and cooked to crisp perfection and it was served with a mango salsa and cilantro dressing.  I can't wait to eat here again. I LOVE IT!!! [REVIEW_14] While at Drexel University; I decided to try a new food truck and go for something that wasn't the typical food truck.  My girlfriend and I always noticed this place was crowded around lunch but never knew why.  After being recommended to try it by a friend; we decided to go ahead and order lunch here.  Cucina Zapata is at the end of the food truck row at the center of Drexel University's campus.  The truck has a graffiti style design which can be easily distinguished from the other food trucks here.  I decided to order (2) thai short rib tacos while my girlfriend got the cap'n crunch tilapia burrito.  The food has a good visual appearance which made us more eager to eat it once we got inside the building.  I really enjoyed the thai short rib tacos even though they put hot sauce on it.  They were definitely better than the typical taco bell food and left me with a 5 star review feeling inside.  My girlfriend also really enjoyed her burrito.  Overall; this food truck provides very good food at a good price.  I recommend this place to anyone looking for a good lunch. [REVIEW_15] I have to say you get MORE for what you pay! This hotel is clean and organized. The staff are very respectful and responsive! ALSO breakfast was excellent!! OMG eggs; sausage; waffles; OJ; you name it!",15
83,"[REVIEW_1] New Orleans use to be all about service. My wife and I were running a few minutes late because our 1 year old needed to be changed right as we left the house. Mr B's would not seat my father until we arrived. It is time for Mr B's to get with the times. [REVIEW_2] Slllooowweeessttt deli counter ever! Been waiting for over 20 minutes for the Daily Special of all things. I could have caught the fish myself in this amount of time. [REVIEW_3] Inattentive and confused waiters could have been either inexperienced or under staffed. Bring SPF 45 sunblock in case you seated near the neon sign. Food was par. Bring crayons; tables are covered in paper. Bottom line: tonight was my first and last experience at st. Tropez. [REVIEW_4] I absolutely love this place and think is easily the best burrito shop in town. Great salsas; relaxed atmosphere; excellent service and price;  Most importantly the burritos are delicious. The chicken and chorizo combo is  my personal favorite but the smoked brisket is great as well. The medium burrito is plenty unless you are training for an eating event.  Family owned; not a chain and it shows in the attention to flavor. Highest recommendation if you are interested in good; healthy food (unless you eat yourself into oblivion) at a reasonable price. [REVIEW_5] Tonight I went to Superior Grill expecting a delicious tex mex meal with great vibes. First it began with the rude waitress; then the manager came over and made in an appropriate ""joke"" regarding my ethnicity. The cherry on top to this awful evening was when i was served lifeless skinned rubber meat on a platter with lettuce and PEANUT SAUCE; what mexican restaurant puts peanut sauce on a salad. I would recommend not going here EVER unless you want slithery chicken weenus sliding down your throat. [REVIEW_6] We ate here tonight. The lettuce on my wife's salad was limp; the chicken was under cooked and the salad was drench in salad dressing. My dinner tasted good but was cold. By the time I got back to our motel room; the bathroom was all that was on my mind. Never again. [REVIEW_7] I had one of the top three worst restaurant experiences of my life here. One example is that my wife got a lukewarm burrito and sent it back after talking with the manager. The burrito came back partly eaten....by the chef....as the manager said she has the chef taste things when complained about....AND SHE BROUGHT THIS BURRITO BACK TO OUR TABLE...THE MANAGER  (who said she is part of the founding family). This is after waiting more than 90 minutes for our food. On top of that; the food is mediocre at best. Now I've read El Charro is selling burritos at 7-Eleven stores in California....enough said. Do yourself a favor and go to Poco and Mom's or even Guadalajara Grill. El Charro is WAY past its expiration date and those running it now no longer know how to serve excellent; or even decent; Mexican food. [REVIEW_8] Rudest bartenders I've encountered. Made us wait forever for drinks while they texted. Female bartender lost my husband's card when I tried to close out our tab and told me to calm down when I explained the green card she was holding wasn't ours. she insisted she did not have my husband's card at all and continued to speak to me like I was a moron. Never going back again! [REVIEW_9] awesome place.  good food. nice people.  rotating specials.  all home made.  what else do you want?  Chicken salad is a great pickup to make sandwiches at home. [REVIEW_10] Ok had Sunday lunch with my mother and grandmother here and it was just terrible. Our server didn't even tell us his name and took forever for him to take our drink order. We asked for sweet and low with one of our unsweet teas and didn't receive it. Had to ask for it again to then receive the sweet and low. We ordered the bloomin onion and the chesse fries. The bloomin onion was not the onion the restaurant usually uses because it was on the spicy side. The chesse fires when on the ok side since they did not put much chesse or bacon on the appetizer. So in all reality we ordered a plate of fires with a little chesse and bacon. My grandmother ordered the 6oz steak and it was also on the spicy side. I however ordered the same thing but I ordered mine medium rare but when I got my steak it was rare instead of medium rare and also was really spicy.  We then had to ask for a bottle of steak sauce because if you ask for steak sauce for a party of three you will only get one tiny cup full of steak sauce for the whole table. Had to order a to go order for my father couldn't make it to lunch and our waiter said he would put it in after we had finished our meal. When we finished our food and the waiter gave us our check we still haven't received our to go order. Had to sit and extra five to ten minutes to get that said order. Lets just say we gave a bad tip. Be caution to this place not worth a hundred dollar bill for a spicy mouth and bad experience! [REVIEW_11] Stay anywhere but here! They got so little right during our three night stay. Staff not at all helpful during check in when our prepaid rooms had been reassigned to other guests. Maids were the noisiest we've heard in the mornings; playing TV loud with doors open while cleaning; joking around in the hallways in front of doors with Do Not Disturb signs. They actually were whistling loudly up and down the hallway in order to wake the guests!They made up the beds without straightening the bottom sheets. A child could do a better job of making a bed. The elevators smelled; noisy AC units; tiny bathrooms -- we even had to ask for water glasses for our rooms. From what I hear; all this is typical of a Hyatt Place. We won't be staying at one again. [REVIEW_12] Not knowing Carpinteria at all; we yelped the best lunch and Padaro came up. We really liked it! The fish & chips and grilled fish tacos were great; very fresh; no fishy taste whatsoever. Great draft beer selection; too!  The cute beachy area for the kids to play is an awesome idea for those with little. The counter area faces the beach/ocean with various heights of the chairs for your perfect view. We highly recommend Padaro!!! [REVIEW_13] I have read some of the other reviews and should have read them before trying this place.  Eating should be enjoyable.  I have started eating at Jade Garden at Hillsborough and Habana.  Definitely worth the drive to get some quality Chinese food. [REVIEW_14] I guess it would be necessary to state that I am of Jamaican descent; and as many of us know it is very hard to find food comparable to back home or equivalent to mom's cooking. Its been some time since I have frequented this restaurant; I stopped going for sometime because the food became very inconsistent.  Fast forward to today; i decided to stop by since some years had passed.  I ordered the ox tail and jerk chicken wings...  I just have to say that i was VERY disappointed. The oxtail though tender was very small and full of fat... more fat than meat and small portions at that...the rice was stale.  But what was really disappointing was the jerk wings.. I took one bite and ended up spitting out the chicken..  I just couldn't believe that an establishment would serve this....i assume no one in the kitchen samples the food before it comes out... they just cant... there is no way someone could think its okay to serve such dry tasteless food.  I was right to stay away for years; and i will be doing so again... [REVIEW_15] We were really excited to try the Sunday Brunch . We just moved to Dunedin and have been to many spots on Main Street ( Living Room; Casa Tina ; Black Pearl; Pisces; Bon Appetite; Sea Sea Riders ) and had great food and fun . We got there around noon and it was busy . The hostess was sort of confusing but we told her table for two inside . She gave us a pager and showed us to the bar . The bar seats were full so we sort of stood by the door . We were there around 10 minutes when another couple came in and checked in at the hostess stand and came into the bar to wait . About 20 minutes later I checked in at hostess stand and was surprised they were working off two waiting lists - I thought that was odd . The hostess told me not too much longer . The next couple sat was the couple who came in 10 minutes after us . We were called by the host who proceeded to seat us outside . I told him we had asked for inside he was very nice and apologized saying he thought we were first available but now saw we had asked for inside . As we walked back to the bar we saw the 10 minute arriving after us couple at their inside table and decided to leave . We told the hostess ;who really only cared what number our pager was ; that we were upset and she seemed not to really care at all . After repeating that I was upset about the couple being sat before us she mumbled something about coming back and trying them again ! What ?!! Too many places on Main Street for that kind of service . We go out a lot and we won't be going to Kelly's again . We stoped in on Thursday night to the outside bar and asked the new bartender ( she was sweet but not trained ) if it was happy hour she said she didn't know and had to go find out . We enjoyed our drink watching the new bartender and bar back decide what she was going to eat ... that should have been a clue not to try Brunch .",3
84,"[REVIEW_1] Some of the best eats I've ever had !! The Crawfish Beignets and Crab Cakes are worth making the trip to New Orleans alone. Certainly a stop I'll make any time I'm in the area; and highly recommend you do the same ! [REVIEW_2] Wonderful experience and amazing food. We sat at the food prep counter and could watch the chefs prepare dishes. It was really cool to watch and they were all very friendly and communicative. We were even greeted with a complimentary tasting when first seated. Loved everything about the experience! [REVIEW_3] The steak is okay. I give it a 1 because it's not worth the price. Very expensive. You can find a much better steak at other restaurants in town. Plus; my experience was dampened by some annoying couple trying to sell me real estate as I ate at the bar. [REVIEW_4] Great lunch specials for $6 or $7; entree soup and rice. Lots of variety for dinner with most entrees under $12. The food is excellent. Service is attentive. The restaurant is clean; modern; very pleasant. Enthusiastically recommended. [REVIEW_5] I have tried this place twice ever and it was disgusting and greasy both times. Won't go back.. [REVIEW_6] A must go-to place if you're in University City. This place's chaat and lassi are to die for. It tastes fresh and refreshing; and will fill you up. My recommendation for chaat: go for the mild; even if you like really spicy food. It's not because it's super spicy (it still has a kick though) but because the balance of flavors is better with the mild chaat. The spicy chaat; the spiciness overpowers the rest of the goodies and it gets a bit too saucy for me. As for lassis; I've had the mango; rose; and mint - all I would recommend. [REVIEW_7] I concur with the other comments that this place is awful.   The service here was about as bad as I have ever seen.   The food arrived cold and had to be sent back - which of course turned into a big ordeal.    Until the management here shows some leadership and sets some higher expectations of their service and kitchen staff; I would avoid this place. [REVIEW_8] Was in town for a meeting; and have always wanted to try Luke's; and only a 3 min walk from the Marriott Courtyard. I had Oysters; Salad; and Chicken for my main dish. Absolutely the best I've ever had! Great service; friendly staff; didn't have a reservation; but only took 5mins to seat me in a packed house; on a Thursday night. [REVIEW_9] Very disappointed. We went to eat  at 2:15 on Saturday and were told the kitchen closed at 2. Their website says: Sat & Sun all day. Their website claims that they are open until 5. I'm always a bit suspect of places that can't manage simple details like their hours on their website. It makes me wonder about the awareness to quality and other ""small"" items. [REVIEW_10] The Red Pony was without a doubt a hit!  My wife and I held our rehearsal dinner there; with a group of 30 people!  Good food; good drinks; and great service made the night an absolute success; and there were smiles on the faces of every single person there.  The staff went out of there way to make us feel at home and see that our every wish and desire was satisfied.  Kari was invaluable in helping us set up our menu and coordinating the dinner.  She even put together custom menus with our selections and our names!  She also saw to it that our party had our own secluded portion of the upstairs so we could all celebrate together without interruption from other guests (or more likely; without us interrupting the others!). It was perfect.  The building is gorgeous; the decor is choice; and the artwork is beautiful.  Of course; I'm sure you're wondering about the food. No worries there.  In the skilled and capable hands of the chef; Dwight; our taste buds were delighted and our stomachs full.  All of the food - appetizers; salads; entrees; and desserts were all unique; all delectable; and all a feast.  There wasn't a disappointed mouth in the room. It was spectacular.  All in all; it was a lively celebration that neither I nor any of our guests will soon forget.  I can't recommend highly enough the Red Pony for your large party; or even for your small dinner for two (done that too!).  I've dealt with a number of the staff and sampled a variety of the dishes; and there is absolutely no way you can go wrong here. [REVIEW_11] Best dinner I've had in a while! Our server Steven was amazing; he couldn't have been more knowledgeable about wine and helped us pick out the perfect bottle for the occasion. If you want a fantastic experience; go here and ask for him! [REVIEW_12] Walked up with a group to serve 10 - parents and kids.  After trying to get someone to come to walk up window; we left because they were ignoring us 5-10 minutes and no one else was waiting for walk up service. [REVIEW_13] i have a feeling people only write reviews about party supply places if they have a bad experience;;;so;let me change that up. jumpmaxx is a great company;;they called ahead  to ask if they could come early as they had a lot of set ups;;;and called back to to tell me when they would be back;;;their prices are great;;;and service was outstanding and friendly;;;the jumping castle was clean and new;;;;;all in all;;;""top notch"";!!!!!! [REVIEW_14] Having just read about Marc Vetri and his eponymous restaurant in Bon Appetit (Sept issue); and having a scheduled trip to Philly; we decided to visit this much lauded Italian restaurant. You might have missed this place walking by it. The restaurant has only 35 seats; a very cozy atmosphere as you would find in typical Italian restaurants. Buon Ricordo (good memory) ceramic plates on the wall remind you that this chef travels to Italy often to further immerse himself in food.  The menu is updated weekly and changes with the season. They also offer 6 and 8 course tasting menus during the summer. We called just a day before our visit (they book 2 months ahead) we were very lucky to get in! The chef and staff were so welcoming and treated us like royalty! Here's what we ate:  Antipasti - huge antipasto round with lots of yummy grilled; marinated vegetables; smoky cheeses; mixed greens with grana; and freshly sliced ethereal slices of prosciutto done a la minute and brought to our table. We also ordered the Crisp Suckling Pig with Roasted Corn antipasto that was so delicious! The chef also sent out the Foie Gras Pastrami with Cherry Mostarda (the foie gras is ""cured"" like pastrami - this was such an amazing dish!).  For pastas; we ordered the Mint Pappardelle with Lamb and Sweet Pea Ragu and the signature Spinach Gnocchi with Shaved Ricotta and Brown Butter. Lots of butter in the gnocchi sauce! The gnocchi were almost entirely made of spinach - and just so light and delicate. The chef also sent out a taste of the not-on-the-menu corn ravioli with shaved black summer truffles from italy. Divine!  We decided to share the main course  - another signature: Roasted Capretto (baby goat) with Soft Polenta - it was out of this world! Chef Marc Vetri presented each dish to us; and this was especially incredible - they roast the goat outdoors for hours. It was so tender!   Such a great experience and we loved meeting Marc. He is an incredible chef and we will be back! [REVIEW_15] Love the interiors. Makes the whole place really interesting! The room was very clean and service was great.",10
85,"[REVIEW_1] Wanted to try this place for the first time. We pick up a menu to order later. A few hours later we called for delivery. After placing our order we wanted to pay with a debit card. They told us they only take cards in the store. Delivery is cash only!!  I canceled the order and call gin house. [REVIEW_2] A few years ago my parents; my brothers and i went to this restaraunt for my birthday. We ordered the usual huge spread because we love thai food. But there was a surprise in the tea. A roach; swimming around. The server brought a new pot (no apology) and that was all. No taking the tea off the bill; no acknowledgement of what happened; nothing. We haven't eaten there since. [REVIEW_3] Have eaten here twice now on two separate trips to Nashville and each meal has been fantastic. The first trip I got the sweet potato pancakes which are so fluffy it is like they are made with clouds Delicious. The second go round I got some eggs and sausage which of course comes with a side of pancakes. Not only are the pancakes great but everything else was cooked perfectly and served with whipped butter that was probably made in heaven. My son got the wild blueberry pancakes which were equally fantastic. Get there before 8 AM and you shouldn't have to wait in the lines out the door. Make sure you get a free parking pass to put on the dash of your car as well. Great experience and worth getting up early for. Probably worth the wait too but I'm not into waiting in the snow like most folks on our first trip there! [REVIEW_4] If you are looking to go somewhere where customer service is not a priority; this is your place. Extremely rude and unprofessional waitresses. Every other place on Broadway had accommodating waitstaff. Highly disappointed in the lack of training that seems to be happening in a place that has potential. [REVIEW_5] We've eaten here many many times and I'm finally gotten around to writing this. This place is the best Asian restaurant in the Phoenixville area. First let me explain I DO NOT eat Sushi; I would sooner lick a ddoor knob than eat raw fish. I stick to the Chinese side of the menu. I have had Hot & Sour; Wonton; Chicken & rice soups; Teriyaki chicken; Kung Pao Chicken; Sesame Chicken; Beef w/broccoli; Beef w/garlic; Mango Shrimp (my favorite) and many more. Their lunch specials (11-3) are a REAL bargain. Make sure you order hot tea; it is made with real loose tea in a cast iron tea pot. The staff (the owners?) are VERY friendly and gracious. I'll go back again and again. [REVIEW_6] First of all i wasn't greeted . Then we was serve on dirty trays that was wiped with dirty rags . Also the restroom was disgusting as well as table and chairs we sat on. Sorry but will not be coming back and definitely spreading the word of this place. [REVIEW_7] I have been to a couple of Keke's in other cities; however; was exceedingly disappointed with my experience today. After an hour of waiting we were told our order was misplaced and it would be out shortly. I understand these things happen; yet the employees and manager made no attempts to make our experience better. The manager acknowledged once the food was delivered that the portions were small and inaccurate. However; icing on the cake was the waitress dropping off the check as we finally got our first bite. Not to check on us even during the rest our meal. If someone had made a single attempt to make our experience better I would not be writing this review; but today I paid for extremely poor service and I do not plan to return. [REVIEW_8] I can't say enough good things about this wonderful Sushi restaurant in Riverview!  The staff are incredibly friendly and timely!  The sushi is so fresh and tasty!!  One of my all time favorites!! [REVIEW_9] Great food for a great price! Every time i have gone in to Bab Cafe the staff is always super helpful and educated on their product and make recommendations. Would 10/10 recommend to anyone! [REVIEW_10] This is the worst Mexican food I've ever had. The salsa definitely comes from a jar. My friend got an agave sweetened margarita for $9 and we all thought it tasted like straight agave nectar and water. The cheese on the tacos looks like Kraft cheese from a bag; and the only other topping was iceberg lettuce. You might be able to find better food at a gas station. [REVIEW_11] I really wanted to be able to leave a good review; this place is within walking distance so the location is super convenient.  Basically; the food is mediocre; which is fine; I can handle so-so tasting food. It's the experience portion of dining here that caused such a low review. I saw the good and bad reviews; but I'm fair and like to judge from my own experience; so I came in with neutral expectations. I came in with a group of six people. We ordered separately; I was the first to order. However; our food took 25 minutes; and when we asked what the holdup was; no one seemed to know or care. We did end up letting them know the service was poor; and the guy I was explaining to walked away as I was speaking! He flat out did not care.  At this point; that's just plain rude. We tried to complain to the woman managing the floor and her response was; ""oh.""  Apparently; we weren't the only ones complaining; as we were walking out; another customer walked in to get her money back because her boyfriend has already been served and finished his food while she still hadn't gotten hers. This place has potential; but until they realize that service is an equally important part of the restaurant experience; they probably won't even try to improve. Such a bummer. [REVIEW_12] We came here based on the recommendation we received and from the street it doesn't look like much. But when you sit down and you scan the menu you will come to realize that this place serves nothing but home-cooked comfort food. We had the BLT and it was packed full of flavor; they didn't scrimp on the bacon and the vegetables for very fresh. With the sandwiches came some of the best french fries that we've had; and some of the best coleslaw that I've had in the state of Florida. We took a couple of pies home and they were delicious. We will definitely come back. [REVIEW_13] OMG I just left this place an hour ago and I'm considering pressing charges !! I walked in about 30 mins before closing i simply went In asking for their price for a fill the lady said $18 && if I waited 5 mins they can do them tonight ! The lady who does the fills claimed her name was "" Tracy "" seemed mad she didn't even say hello then she started arguing with her coworker and during their argument she pulled my arm and twisted my hand i seriously wanted to cry !! She also cut me !! My fill looks horrible ! She was very  rude !! They ended up charging me $24 how ?? Idk never going there again !! I will be calling them tomorrow for a full refund or I will press charges after all she knows she messed up because after she pulled my arm she said "" sorry "" and kept arguing !!  I was the last one there and when my nails were done she just said ""ok bye "" no thank you for coming or legit  Apology !! [REVIEW_14] My husband is a huge fan of Chinese buffets; but this place did not live up to its name. At all. We got there 5 minutes after they opened expecting fresh food on the buffet. It tasted like they brought out yesterday's leftovers. The baked chicken was over cooked. Most items were sitting in puddles of grease. Everything we put on our plates was cold or lukewarm. The egg drop soup was bland. Sushi had very little variety (every roll had cucumber and crab; and then something else on top). They do offer a military discount; but at the higher Sunday price it was NOT worth it. There are other options in town. Stay away from this place. [REVIEW_15] what a wonderful place!!!!!!ive been regular customer of holt's for years;and would never go any where else!!!!this is the first;and best cigar retailer in the east coast;;;and they are the best!!!!!!!amily run;and you feel it with sincere;;caring service;;and their online store is incredible!!!!best sales and offers on a regular basis;;;;;;;;their selection and quality  is exceptional!!!!!!!!10 stars!!!!!-eric",6
86,"[REVIEW_1] This is hands down THE best Thai Restaurant in the area and quite frankly;  anywhere.  The food is delicious and has become our go-to comfort food. Try the Red Curry and Drunken Noodles.  By far the tastiest anywhere!  The owners and staff are so kind and friendly and make everyone feel like family. I'd give them 10 stars if I could! [REVIEW_2] We stopped here off a recommendation. The breakfast was really incredible and the juice was so fresh. I would definitely give this place a shot if you're in the area! [REVIEW_3] When a review is only 1 star; then there really isn't too much to write. The service was inattentive; the cheeseburgers were cooked on the surface of the sun (evidently; based on how charred they were); and there was a large roach that crawled across our table after we were served our food.  A note of warning to waiters: you ARE; in fact; responsible to ensure that the food you serve is a reasonable approximation of how it is ordered; especially if it is visibly cooked less or more than requested of you. [REVIEW_4] A really great find! Made fresh which means the food takes a bit of time...well worth it. The chicken enchalidas were excellent. [REVIEW_5] I had take out from here tonight so this review is solely the food. My first time here even though I live around the corner. I ordered the Buffalo chicken salad with romaine letteus and blue cheese dressing. It was amazing! Greens were fresh and crispy; blue cheese dressing not full of chunks; and chicken delicious. I will definitly be going back for this salad. [REVIEW_6] The worst... Food was cold and tasteless.  We thought we were eating week old leftovers.  When this place closes; I hope the guys from Zaynas will take it over so we can have a good place to go in this part of town. [REVIEW_7] I wish I could give this zero stars; this gave my husband and kid a really really bad stomach ache after eating here. This used to be our favorite Chinese restaurant but not anymore. Never eat here. Also on another note the delivery really slow. [REVIEW_8] Never coming back. This is the second we've given then. Tonight; they charged us an extra $5; but was easily correct; not a huge deal. Second; the onion rings tasted like vanilla! We ordered a brownie cookie dough blast and got a cookie dough shake instead; the difference of about a dollar. My shake was missing the middle portion(see photo). The only good thing about this trip was the mozzarella sticks. 2 shakes and 2 sides for $15; no thanks. [REVIEW_9] I came here with my girlfriends and let me tell you; it gets packed fast. We ate oysters for breakfast and it was so worth it. The server that we had memorized all 6 of our complicated customized orders. I was very impressed. Oysters here taste like the fresh ocean. I ordered the oyster po-boy and that deliciousness came out fast. I definitely recommend this place when visiting NOLA. [REVIEW_10] Just found my new favorite place for pizza; didn't get any of the pizzas listed on the menu; built our own. Pepperoni; sliced red onions; roasted garlic. Was perfect; not too much cheese; the right amount of pepperoni; onions weren't over powering; and the garlic...oh yes; not your run of the mill minced garlic; but cloves of roasted garlic. All their pizzas are 10""; perfect amount for two; didn't try any of the appetizers; but I'm going to do their survey; and get one for free. Looking forward on going back....real soon. [REVIEW_11] Cute setting in Lafayette Square. Homemade Bread brought complimentary as you wait for your meal!! It was delicious....warm and soft! We had the toasted ravioli for an appetizer that was very good (pretty standard). It had a good marinara sauce for dipping. I got the whole wheat penne with a house-made meatball. It was very good. meatball tasted more like sausage than beef (I prefer beef); but still good. My husband got the canneloni; which he also really enjoyed. They offer 1/2 portions on the menu; which I got; and still wasn't able to finish my pasta. I can't wait to go back---really the bread set the stage for the whole dinner! Our waitress; Erin; was also very friendly and knowledgeable. Our glasses never went empty. [REVIEW_12] I could make a jacks pizza taste better than their pizza with little effort.  We ordered two pizzas both horrible. Taste like cheap ingredients. Shouldn't be around long. [REVIEW_13] --------DINNER REVIEW----------  I rarely write reviews; but this honestly was one of the worst group dining experiences I've ever had. It was objectively a horrible experience; even without comparing it to the hype it receives; and ruined what was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner celebration.   We had a group of 8 that had a reservation made well in advance. Short wait; but not too bad. Keep in mind; it seemed like a normal Friday night; but weren't super busy or at-capacity.  It was a birthday dinner; so I told the hostesses that it was her birthday; and asked if they could bring out something for her at the end of the meal; which was acknowledged. Pretty standard stuff; whether at a Applebee's or the French Laundry. We were sat at a booth right next to the Maitre D' stand; and next to all the wait staff's home base; so pretty much no excuse for not getting any attention.   After getting us waters; it took them a LONG time to even come by and acknowledge us. After ordering wine; it took them another good 15-20 minutes to even bring us our wine; and no one even checked in on us! (hint: if you're running a restaurant; wine is your profit center and doesn't take any work other than taking a bottle off a shelf and opening it. bring it out ASAP...).   After ordering food; it was more of the same...a long wait for food to start coming out and no one checking in on us AT ALL. We drank the bottles we ordered and had to get up and flag someone down to get another wine order. A couple of us even got up during the meal to remind them to bring out something for birthday girl at the end of the meal.   Once our meal was done and taken away; we were given dessert menus and the server disappeared for 10-15 minutes... AGAIN. After coming back; he asked what dessert we wanted; so we ordered some coffees... and waited... and waited. Eventually we got up and asked him what was going on and if they were going to bring anything out like we asked multiple times.   They finally brought out a couple of cookies with a candle...  In summary; the food was pretty hit or miss; pretty mediocre for this price point. Whipped feta; like other reviews have said; was amazing; and the Braised Lamb was really good. But the Sirloin was chewy and bland and the Grilled Caesar tasted like a soggy; luke-warm; wilted mess (two orders were left untouched by a group of 8). Atmosphere was nice and trendy. But the service; which is a huge reason to spend your hard-earned $ at a restaurant; was absolutely horrendous.   I really love going to cool; popular restaurants and having a great time; and I hate writing such a negative review; but I had to share my experience; especially for a restaurant that is getting an awful lot of (undeserved) hype. [REVIEW_14] Great sandwiches! They run about $5-$7 each and no they don't come with French fries but if you compare that to the average sandwich at a certain sandwich chain that claims to have 12-inch sandwiches; Javan's sandwiches at only 9 inches for the large size blow commercial chain sandwiches to smithereens. Super packed with meat; cheeses; vegetables; and whatever else you want; I've gotten the Chicken Club and the Philly Cheesesteak and both are to die for. French-fries here are great too.   Really great for groups of college kids; there's a lot of space indoors and outdoors; a large TV and old school arcade games. Definitely bring cash though; like most places in IV there is a 50 cent charge on Credit/Debit cards. [REVIEW_15] I'm very displeased with my experience here the girl up front was very rude when I went up to the bar to get some drinks I was not carded when my friends who are african American went up right after me they were carded which they were already carded up front so I don't understand why they were carded twice and I was only once I think that was very racist of them the workers there just make you feel uncomfortable for being there i had such high hopes for this place I am so let down I will not be returning",8
87,"[REVIEW_1] Rating were good. But still waiting for our dinner .   Extremely slow service ..appetizer and drinks were mediocre at best .  Was really looking forward to this meal. But would never recommend . Hope dinner shows up before sunrise .. [REVIEW_2] I was very disappointed with the cake I ordered. I picked it up at the shop. The service was very slow and I paid for the cake before I picked it up. I sat there for 10-15 minutes just for someone to wrap a bow around the already boxed cake. I ordered the White and Black Cake. The icing was not sweet at all and it was greasy. The cake was heavy and did not have much of a flavor. The cake was certainly not worth $70. [REVIEW_3] Highly; highly overrated.  The food was a C minus at best.  And the service was so bad that I may never go back.  They screwed up my order completely and my no apologies.  There are a lot of other options around State Street.  Avoid this place like the plague. [REVIEW_4] Sheesh stay far far far away. The prices are ridiculous for completely mediocre food. Wings were gummy; soup luke-warm; and fries cold. It's a chain; but damn that was bad. Do yourself a favor and go down the street to the perky instead. The price and food are way better there. [REVIEW_5] I want to thank Eric @paintlessautodents.com  Eric is a wizard! I purchased a preowned Cadillac XTS from Coleman Cadillac. There was a minor dent to the car that I requested be fixed before I would purchase the car. Coleman promised that they would have it fixed shortly after delivery. I met Eric from paintlessautodents today at Coleman Cadillac and the man did an awesome job on the car; I cannot tell that there was ever an imperfection in the area he fixed. I highly recommend his services and will not hesitate to use him again should the need arise. Eric does come from Philadelphia and will not come North of the Lawrenceville/Princeton area. I cannot discuss prices as the dealership picked up the cost. Eric is the owner of the company and clearly takes pride in his work. Before taking your car to an auto body shop I Recommend reaching out to Eric first as he may save you time; money and inconvenience. [REVIEW_6] I purchased a Groupon for a 3-hour cleaning and a three month membership to the Forever Clean Club. I am 2 months into my membership and have only been able to use the service in one out of four attempts. I was understanding after the first cancellation and simply rescheduled my appointment. After the second time; I asked to extend my membership for another month as I had gone a full month without having been able to use it. I was told my membership could not be extended as it was a voucher and I was given a $25 credit to my account for a 'future cleaning' in compensation.   I have now been canceled on a third time. Today I didn't even receive a phone call. I received only an email; though curiously it states that they were ""recently in touch"" to let me know about the cancellation. Perhaps they were confused and were thinking of the last 2 times they cancelled? That aside; the email was sent an hour before the scheduled start time. Apart from the general inconvenience of being cancelled and left with a house that needs to be cleaned; I had left work early (using personal time) and was on my way home to receive the cleaner by the time I saw the e-mail. The e-mail provided no contact information; only links to Facebook and Twitter accounts. I found a phone number on a previous e-mail from one of the client account specialists who had contacted me following a previous cancellation so I called that number. I spoke with a lovely gentleman who confirmed that I have experienced a high number of cancellations. He told me that a member of the Trust and Safety Department was to have contacted me previously to follow up regarding my first 2 cancellations. I let him know that I had received no such call.  He told me that I would receive a call from that department; most likely later today; to hopefully resolve the issue. We'll see if that happens but I know for sure that I will not be recommending you to anyone and I will be contacting the BBB for a resolution if your team doesn't provide a refund for the 'membership' that I have been unable to use.  UPDATE: The company ended up refunding me $20 (I was asking for $30 to cover the cost of the membership I was unable to use) so that was at least something. The person who emailed me apologized and told me that the frequent cancellations were due to limited availability in my area. I find it disingenuous to give that as an excuse after I went to the site; I looked at a calendar of available times for a specific cleaner and chose from those times and was even sent a confirmation. If those times weren't available then they shouldn't be listed. Limited availability; to me; would mean I would have a difficult time booking the appointment in the first place; not be cancelled on at the last minute.   As they are a broker site (which I didn't realize at first) and not the actual provider company; these cleaners accept jobs booked from the site and I assume then cancel if a higher paying opportunity comes up.  If that's the case; there should be a system in place that penalizes the cleaners for canceling (since the consumer is penalized for a last minute cancellation) or better yet does not allow them to book through the site after a certain number of cancellations. [REVIEW_7] I had a horrible experience here. The waiter was great but as I got my appetizer; there was it has a hair in it. Next the noodles came out mine was fine but my friend has a huge hair in his. I thought he was joking until he told me. After that it ruined my appetite; I gave the noodles back and they didn't even give me a new one; I thought I should've got the food for free at that point.. never eating here again [REVIEW_8] Ridiculous prices for small portions/little meat/mostly rice. [REVIEW_9] I received a vase of flowers for Mother's Day and they are terrible. I'm sure my son paid top dollar; because he always does. But this very small bouquet had only three roses that never opened and wilted within two days. The rest of the arrangement was cheap filler flowers. It came in a plain glass vase with dirty water and no bow or ribbon. They forgot the candy that came with it and had to deliver it later in the day. Look elsewhere if you are looking to send an impressive gift; because this one was not. [REVIEW_10] I loved my dinner at Aldine last weekend. I give the food; the service; and the ambiance all five stars. The highlights were the pastina with wild mushrooms (on the menu); pasta with boar; and mushroom; barley; egg dish (both were specials--they had fancier names than what I listed but I can't recall). Really interesting flavors; all of them. Also; tried two very interesting brews from Tired Hands Brewery. The servers were friendly and professional. And; the very special treat was that we could hear each other speak (which seems to have become rare or maybe my hearing is just getting worse). I am already planning my return trip. This place is going in my top five with Zahav; Fitler; Barbuzzo; and ... ok my top four. [REVIEW_11] Great place to go for breakfast; brunch; lunch or whatever! Service is great...selections are great for coffee; tea and now beer and wine! Atmosphere is nice and laid back. Staff actually remembers your name. [REVIEW_12] Very poor service; very greasy pizza. The pizza I ordered didn't even have the same toppings as described in the menu.  The table was never wiped; the food sat for several minutes in view before it was delivered.  The table next to us had dirty dishes on it almost the whole time.  I think everything else in the Indianapolis airport is better. [REVIEW_13] Having worked 5 doors down from Fairmount Pet Shoppe for the last few months; I have been passing by and seeing the oh-so-cute kitties in the windows for a while now. Today; I finally relented and went in.   Know this about me: I love cats. I have 8 cats. My mission in life is making them happy. The wife and I buy them the best food we can; groom them and keep them general pampered pusses. I am a cat person.   Soooo it is with AWSOMENESS that finally a pet shop opened which caters more to cats than dogs. Let's face it- dogs get the glory. Every pet shop- from the small boutique to the overwhelming superstores- is about 60% dogs; 25& cats; 15% everything else.   But not Fairmount Pet Shoppe. This joint is 75% cats. Who cares what else is there? NOT ME!!! Cat toys; cat grooming products; cat treats and best of all- CATS!  Props for spelling ""shop"" the way they do. Pointless. And cool. [REVIEW_14] Just visited Station 52 today for lunch and was disappointed.  Food was mediocre at best. The nachos were a joke; the salsa is not fresh; all food seems to be frozen and reheated. They display specials on a blackboard as you enter but fail to mention they are only valid at the bar. Found this out once we received the bill. My wife ordered the Greek chicken pita which comes with fries and she asked to have old bay fries instead of standard fries. We get the bill and they charged us for a basket of old bay fries and when questioned why the charge for a basket; they said the Greek Pita came with chips but we didn't even get the chips.  The waitress then says ""oh I thought you wanted to sub fries for the chips"" then why did we get charged the full amount for the basket of fries; there should have been some discount if it was a sub. The waitress completely forgot my drink refill and brought it out with the check about 10-15 minutes after she took my glass. Overall very bad experience; won't be back. [REVIEW_15] Absolute garbage company. Trying to get from Indy to Chicago and they are more than an hour late; did not inform me of the delay; and their entire customer policy (feel free to read it on the website) consists of ""we cannot be held responsible for anything."" Sitting at a bus stop with 20 people whom are all having their time wasted with absolutely no recourse.",4
88,"[REVIEW_1] LOVED everything about this place.  Friendly; quaint and AWESOME FOOD!  We're from Kansas City and hard to impress with BBQ.......but they were great!.  Pulled Pork; Baked Beans; Coleslaw; Turkey; DELICIOUS.  Generous portions.  They need to bottle and sell that sauce! [REVIEW_2] I haven't done ballet since I was a kid; but I LOVE the Intro to Ballet Class at this place. I've often felt like ballet classes; even beginner ones are too advanced for me at other place; and this particular class is challenging; but not filled with professional dancers trying to brush up on their skills like at other places. All the instructors I've had have been very professional and pay attention to detail.  I haven't tried any of their other classes; but my friend also loves their hip hop and jazz classes. [REVIEW_3] Terrible service.  I ordered take out and after 25 minutes I had to cancel my order.  I got my money back but what the hell?  It wasn't even busy.  I was watching them as the food came out of the kitchen and neither the kitchen staff nor the people serving had any idea what was going on.  Everyone looked clueless.  I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised that my food never appeared. [REVIEW_4] Sublime! Came here on a recommendation from a NOLA native friend and was not disappointed. Everything we ordered was incredible and our server Gary was excellent. Great cocktails; amazing appetizers (tuna tartare; hamachi curry; marinated shrimp   I strongly recommend this restaurant; definitely will go back next time I visit New Orleans. [REVIEW_5] What a little neighbourhood gem! Amazing espresso drinks; friendly staff; and if you follow their tweets you can salivate over your iPhone as you read about their daily breakfast/lunch menu. Yeah it's a little as small but I've only done takeaway. Planning to eat in really isn't an option in the winter without the patio space. [REVIEW_6] Sad!  Last time eating here.  Over priced; over cooked; under staffed!  Salad ok butt charged $2 for extra anchovies (4 total).  No background music in seating area so we could hear everything the cooks and staff did all weekend but they never ask if we needed anything.  The management has now called me a ""sad little man"" in her response.  I'm not sad just disappointed in a chain restaurant that use to be good.  You should be the one apologizing for the bad food.  And yes that young man was nice butt by then my lunch was already ruined by that horrible excuse of a roast pork sandwich. [REVIEW_7] I am always searching for the perfect cheesesteak after having lived on the East coast; home of awesome cheesesteaks and ""steak bombs"".  I think I have finally found a place in Tucson for great cheesesteaks and that is here! [REVIEW_8] Yats made me switch my favorite cuisine to cajun/creole! Half and half of Chili Cheese Etouffee; B&B; and two portions of bread is my all time favorite! Still working my way through everything they have to offer but its all soooo good. The menu isnt the same every time you go but that means you'll just find another thing on their menu to fall in love with. Its kinda busy here but you know that when they have a line out the door the foods gotta be good. They also have 3 other locations in the Indy area so don't everyone flock to this place; find the one closest to you if youre having withdrawals. Their website shows the menu's of the day for all 4 locations if you want to check and see which one has that special entree that you love. [REVIEW_9] We visit every weekend for breakfast; it's a very nice and cozy cafe with good food and great service. Free wifi too! We recommend it 100%. [REVIEW_10] Once again you arent coming here for anything but the food. It is a place most people will look at and drive by.  However it is another hidden gem of epic proportions. They have a different way of making their food with a slight charred taste that is noticeable if you are any sort of regular at eating asian food.  I recommend the shanghai noodles; the flat noodle and beef with black bean; shredded pork crunchy noodle; and a dumpling soup similar to a wonton soup.   This is another place that you will not regret if you try it. They really shine at the fried noodle dishes; so try keep it close to that if possible. Also try milk tea if you never have before. [REVIEW_11] Love the clothes here; service is excellent; the girls that work here are sweet and helpful [REVIEW_12] If i could give this place a zero stars I would. What a waste of my time. We waited for a seat. Our server... female with dark hair... never told us her name...never brought us bread.... I asked her 3 times for plates when the other server finally brought us bread.  She screwed up my kid's calamari with no parsley on it and never put in my order or my husband's order...we literally sat there for over an hour with no food. I finally asked for the manager and he told us then that he was making our order the priority for the chef...I got up and walked out. Im a chef. I would never have sent calamari with something someone specifically asked for there to not be on it. The server put the calamari in as an appetizer even after i told her it was my daughter's diner. What a terrible experience...i will NEVER eat at this restaurant again..and i will tell Everyone I know what a horrible place this is! [REVIEW_13] My daughter and I went for breakfast; everything was great; my daughter had the chicken and waffles; I has an omelet; besides the food being delicious this place has great coffee; I'm a coffee snob and I love the coffee; our waiter kept my cup full; by the way our service was fantastic. The waiter recommended the happy hour so we will certainly go back not only for breakfast but luch and eventaully happy hour. We used a groupon on this visit but will certainly make this place a regular; at least twicw a month. [REVIEW_14] What a drag. Entrees (bolognese and lasagne) are too salty. Lemoncello cake is just sponge cake with strawberry sauce now.  Drove here from Franklin with high expectations and won't be back.  Salmon was blackened as expected but terribly over cooked to the point of being dry as shoe leather.  Sad. [REVIEW_15] I've been a few times and I haven't been disappointed yet. Its for meat eaters; vegetarians; and vegans. It's nice to have a healthy place to go to.",11
89,[REVIEW_1] Brandon Ravens was the best server. He made us feel so personalized; brought the drinks in literally less than 2 minutes. He is so easy going but knows how to be professional at his job. Islands is a great place to relax; have a drink and maybe a fry or 2. My 2 friends and I felt as if we were in heaven; we love it here. Will definitely be coming back and becoming regulars. We love the entire staff. 10 outta 10 [REVIEW_2] The worker was awesome; this is a review for the company.  The price paid isn't in alignment to the service provided; it is just expensive. The worker is still paid hourly; which motivates him/her to work the hours. I believe it is a better way to hire someone off craigslist and pay them to do a service; rather than hourly. [REVIEW_3] Lunch special is a great deal. Jaguar roll and Shrimp Tempura roll were fantastic! Best sushi place in Indy. [REVIEW_4] Why did it just take over 5 minutes for me to get only a medium coffee?  Because there wasn't any coffee made in a coffee establishment; that's why. In addition; there are non-customers sitting in all of the outdoor seats and the floors and counters are sticky. I'm done with this Cosi. I'll be going to Brew Ha Ha from now on. The customer service is just too poor here. [REVIEW_5] I purchased a Groupon for this restaurant. It's right down the street; but I've never been there. They serve both Greek and Italian cuisine. I was not disappointed. I took my 3 year old daughter and 16 year old sister and we were all pleased. It's a BYOB; so that's great. I didn't bring a bottle given my dining companions; but I want to go back with friends and bring a couple bottles. They give you freshly baked bread. Delish. The toddler had the kids ravioli. She inhaled them. My only complaint was the portion was a bit small. If a 3 year old can gobble it down; imagine a 10 year old. I would order the adult portion next time and bring home the leftovers.   My sister ordered the stuffed shells. She loved them and almost devoured the whole place. I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki platter. The chicken was tender and the tzatziki sauce was unbelievable. The service was great. My sister thought the server was a cutie and we even went back a week later without a Groupon.   It's hard to find a restaurant that pleases all three ages groups. We were all happy with the food and are certainly adding this location into our rotation. [REVIEW_6] Thank you  Best coffee in NOLA Super helpful staff Great service great food  Very clean table  Fast service [REVIEW_7] I can't say enough about Ice Cream 504!! The only bad thing is it's with in walking distance and we're finding ourselves walking everyday to get some amazing homemade ice cream!! The flavors are spot on!  I'd add a picture but it's always eaten before I get a chance! A must stop if your in the area!! [REVIEW_8] The staff was so kind; the food was delicious; and I love the location. I highly recommend the mojito and the cassoulet! [REVIEW_9] You can't get this quality of BBQ anywhere in the area! Hickory Kitchen is a quaint little BYOB BBQ restaurant right in the center of Doylestown! I highly recommend it! [REVIEW_10] My son and I come here often and they never disappoint. Today I got something other than ice cream and the tenderloin sandwich was average but good. Ice cream heavenly as always. Love this place! [REVIEW_11] Amazing food AS USUAL!  There is no better avgolemono in town. The food is fresh and good sized portions. Good wine list and friendly and happy servers. Our waiter sang happy birthday in Greek to a nearby table. Beautiful voice and fun times; [REVIEW_12] Giving five stars simply because the staff here has always been so great. Been in multiple times for various issues and always get very helpful service and diagnostics. The service manager in particular is the bomb! South 6th Ave Autozone is my go-to whenever I have a minor issue with my car or need to pick up a part. [REVIEW_13] Staying at the resort; thought we would grab a bite to eat because of the location next to the pool.  Bartender can not finish one transaction before starting another.   Fails at multi-tasking.  The food came 15 later than told soggy and cold.  Shrimp under cooked.  Chicken strips edible after the 2 inch thick leather exterior.  Yummy.  Fries cold and limp.  I ate on all over St. Pete beach and this was the worse food we encounters.  Don't wast your time; go somewhere else on the strip.  Use it for drinks not grub [REVIEW_14] I had the Chicago style and was more than pleased.  This was hands down the best Chicago style pizza I have ever had; the sauce and sausage were excellent.  Small cozy dining area; nice big bar in the room next to it.  Excellent selection of bottled and draft beer.  Super waite staff.  The house salad was nothing special.  The Chicago style takes 45 minutes; order ahead or enjoy and beer and the person you are with.  I am excited to return and try the thin crust and New York style.  Parking in the rear; beer garden out front. [REVIEW_15] Phenomenal!  I was in NOLA for a conference and a local suggested this restaurant to me; so I checked it out with a co-worker on a Tuesday evening. The food and live music made for an incredible atmosphere. It would be a great date spot! I got the fish tacos and the crab cake/hangar steak; both of which were amazing. I would definitely make the effort to go back if I find myself in New Orleans again.,12
90,"[REVIEW_1] We were really excited to try the Sunday Brunch . We just moved to Dunedin and have been to many spots on Main Street ( Living Room; Casa Tina ; Black Pearl; Pisces; Bon Appetite; Sea Sea Riders ) and had great food and fun . We got there around noon and it was busy . The hostess was sort of confusing but we told her table for two inside . She gave us a pager and showed us to the bar . The bar seats were full so we sort of stood by the door . We were there around 10 minutes when another couple came in and checked in at the hostess stand and came into the bar to wait . About 20 minutes later I checked in at hostess stand and was surprised they were working off two waiting lists - I thought that was odd . The hostess told me not too much longer . The next couple sat was the couple who came in 10 minutes after us . We were called by the host who proceeded to seat us outside . I told him we had asked for inside he was very nice and apologized saying he thought we were first available but now saw we had asked for inside . As we walked back to the bar we saw the 10 minute arriving after us couple at their inside table and decided to leave . We told the hostess ;who really only cared what number our pager was ; that we were upset and she seemed not to really care at all . After repeating that I was upset about the couple being sat before us she mumbled something about coming back and trying them again ! What ?!! Too many places on Main Street for that kind of service . We go out a lot and we won't be going to Kelly's again . We stoped in on Thursday night to the outside bar and asked the new bartender ( she was sweet but not trained ) if it was happy hour she said she didn't know and had to go find out . We enjoyed our drink watching the new bartender and bar back decide what she was going to eat ... that should have been a clue not to try Brunch . [REVIEW_2] I find it hard to believe there are so many people with such low standards when it comes to the Daily Bread.  It is a ripoff of St. Louis Bread Co/Panera Bread; which in of itself I don't mind at all.  I have eaten multiple times at the Daily Bread and have yet to have an enjoyable experience.  The food is so-so at best.  Their sandwiches are basic and lack any real flavor.  I also tried the BBQ Chicken pizza and it was okay.    I certainly wouldn't steer anyone away from this place based on the food.  The food is basic and simple; not bad but also nothing great.  My biggest qualm with the Daily Bread is the service.  The majority of the workers seem utterly uninterested in helping out.  There was a line of about 6 people and one person at the register.  There was no sense of urgency to help any of the customers in line.  We waited for a good 5-6 minutes to put an order in.  After receiving our cups to get our drinks we looked for a clean place to sit and eventually settled on a table top that was the least dirty of the tables available.  There were plenty of open spots but it just appeared as though there was lots of trash left behind.  Does anyone bus these tables?  I anticipate that people are responsible for cleaning up after themselves; but it appeared as though the tables hadn't been effectively cleaned in a while.  There was also some trash on the floor that hadn't been addressed as well.  The order number was called and the order was only halfway completed.  When we asked which sandwich was ours; we were basically ignored as the girl put up two more orders.   After another few minutes the rest of the order came up and we began to eat.  I tried both items and as I stated before; both were okay.  The problem is that the food was just unable to make up for the lack of organization; the slow speed at which we were served; or the cleanliness of the restaurant.  After 3 attempts; I'm writing the Daily Bread off and won't return.  I'd rather go to St. Louis Bread Co; get the same level of food; but in a clean environment and a timely setting. [REVIEW_3] They have the WORST service advisors! Used to be good before Kelly and her team left. Unfortunately; it's convenient to work if I need oil change before I can make it to another Honda dealer. [REVIEW_4] DO NOT GO THERE . The male waiter was only looking at my 7 year old daughter and I tried to get his attention  away but couldn't; a real creeper. The cook in the back looked in our direction and laughed. Will never go back  . Horrible place. please help to rip those guys a new one. [REVIEW_5] WOW!!!!! I can't say enough great things about this establishment. Beyond excellent customer service. Food is really good and the presentation is awesome. This was absolutely my favorite place to eat when I lived in Nashville. And did I mention the great customer service! [REVIEW_6] We liked this theatre the last time we visited but noticed the cleanliness wasn't up to snuff; this was in November 2016. I took the family back for an early matinee and I found the bathrooms  disgusting! I took photos due to another 2 people entering and turning around and leaving the bathroom due to the filth. I talked to R****ll and showed him the photos. His response to me was ""They are like that a lot because people trash them."" The management needs to go through some serious training classes. This AMC is losing their good clientele due to not keeping cleanliness standards higher. I don't want to know about the food items. We wont be back. [REVIEW_7] When I first walked in; it seemed an ok place but by the time I realized it was a mistake to get mani and pedi done here; it was too late. I got shellac done and they applied 10-12 coats of paint and gel.  It started peeling off in 3-4 days.  My nails look all rough after the nail paint has peeled off. Also; the people working there were talking to each other in Mandarin.  I felt really awkward there. They used some neon green colored massage lotion or something.  Ewww.  I am never going back! [REVIEW_8] I went in when they had 4 people working; waited for 15 minutes for my tea latte which came out as basically water. Returned it twice but gave up when the barista offered some other iced tea latte they already had instead. It was still the same - water. The baristas should REALLY REALLY learn how to make their stuff... seriously Starbucks??!!! So disappointed!!!!! :'( [REVIEW_9] My husband & I went to use a Groupon that I bought for him for Father's Day & it was a great time! The Groupon had expired but they let us use the amount paid for the Groupon as a credit towards anything at the bar. We each had a flight and the beer was good! [REVIEW_10] Made reservation a over a week ago with request to be near band. On arrival they had no record of it. And we are stuck in the back next to the bathroom. 5 stars for cocktail;food; band and Atmosphere. 1 stars for utter lack of organization.  The woman who took it said she was new. Always call to confirm I guess. Completely disappointed esp since we've had such amazing experiences here in the past.  There open tables near front and were told they were for people with reservations [REVIEW_11] after reading other reviews of this place. Nothing special. Wouldn't take friends to. Unless they weren't very good ones. Service c. Food c. [REVIEW_12] Food showed up cold; salmon was raw inside; plastic in the dessert; fatty lamb chops and some sort of stringy thing at the bottom of my wine glass!! The service was great though. [REVIEW_13] Great food! And great service. Everything was delicious. I recommend it 100%  Definitely we will comeback again. [REVIEW_14] Terrible; terrible service. Entitled hipsters who confuse orders; give attitude; and ruin customer's experience. The new manager is also frumpy and has awful music taste; think awful 50s - 80s rock/reggae music that's disappeared for a reason; but blared close to full volume. Softer; more neutral music would be greatly appreciated. Terrible consistency with orders too; they don't have consistent standards with coffee etc.  Customers are mostly Penn students; business types who interact with the school (recruiters from NYC etc) and visitors to the area. It's almost as if the staff feel some kind of insecurity or have pride issues serving almost always polite patrons.   Gelato is pretty good and coffee is pretty good but can be sloppily made (I.e mix your own iced latte). Also slimmed down portion sizes and got rid of the bar. The place has a great location and nice open feel to it; but so much potential is lost because of really shitty staff with terrible attitudes. So many frequent customers but the staff make no effort to get to know them (and trust me; they try). I can't emphasise enough how much the staff and manager need to change. [REVIEW_15] Took my bigger dog there for grooming.  She came home with cuts in her ear and uneven fur in the front.  Who knows what else was done wrong.  Be warned... if something happens; you won't be told.  Totally unacceptable!!  Our poor dog has been tramatized of groomers since.  Def don't recommend.",3
91,"[REVIEW_1] best place for live music and inexpensive drinks also pool and nice people my husband i  go there at least once a week and often 2 or 3 times a week [REVIEW_2] Today was our first visit; it's a cool little place in a nice neighborhood. Thankfully they have their own parking lot but there's plenty of street parking too; which is good because it was packed. The inside was nice and cozy and it had plenty of seating; not that it mattered because it was so crowded but I can't fault them for that.  The customer service was really good; although the guy who took our order didn't seem to believe that I knew what a double shot macchiato would be because he kept asking me if I had ever had one before. I badly needed pure caffeine so it was just what I wanted; I'm just not sure what the questioning about my choice was all about.  That being said; when I got it it was great; obviously good quality espresso. My husband got their popular hot chocolate which he wasn't a fan of but I really liked since it tasted like actual chocolate instead of like a powder. He also got an espresso bar which was some kind of sugary chocolate treat; and he loved that. Their to go cups are also really cute. It's out of the way but we'll definitely be back. [REVIEW_3] This place is amazing! The food  meets every expectation. The staff is very friendly.  Sandy ; our server ; treated us like family . This is our go to place ! [REVIEW_4] Soo disappointed. Ordered delivery and specified that it was from a hotel. They brought no utensils and told them I did not specify them. They changed my order without asking me. The kicker was that the Biryani I ordered had hard things in it; some of which were whole cardamon pods but also (and yuck) a partially eaten stone fruit. Please don't get delivery. If anything eat there; but I will not [REVIEW_5] Try the 007 roll... It's amazing! All of the House Specialty Rolls are good. Quaint; quiet and delicious! Temaki is talicious! [REVIEW_6] This small but impressive sidekick to the much larger; and more lavish; Oxford Exchange makes a quick; convenient alternative to those who want something good to go in a hurry.  There is limited seating inside and the menu is not nearly as extensive as its namesake but there are plenty of of satisfying ways to appease your appetite; sate your thirst for iced coffee; get a boost from a juice or make a baked good grab and go.  Be sure to peruse the chilled section for all sorts of ready-to-eat goodies.  Oxford Exchange has been a maverick at shaking up the status quo and this tiny countertop - and counterpart - carries on that tradition quite well. [REVIEW_7] My order was 75% wrong and when I got home to divvy out the food I had ordered; items were missing including a burger [REVIEW_8] Ordered food at noon. Waited 55 minutes for two salads. Friend ordered House Salad; when it arrived it was spring mix; red onions; cucumbers. No cheese; bacon; tomatoes; pecans. When questioned; response was ""the chef changed it."" Without asking the customer?? And to what....the only items we have prepped? Asked for the manager but was told she was in the kitchen.  Guess that sums it up. Obviously will never go back.  One day later UPDATE: A marketing team member reached out to apologize and offered complementary meal as his personal guests should we want to try again. Hope this is indicative of a team trying to right the ship. Stay tuned. [REVIEW_9] I can't wait to go back. It's unbelievably full of everything & anything you could possibly want from an Italian market & you can eat there as well! Unfortunately it closes very early on Saturday but we didn't know & were lucky to get inside before they locked it. A lot of items were already in the process of being put away so we didn't buy very much. Couldn't even get bread or eat there. I was starving so I grabbed some cheese & ate some & of course saved the package to pay for it        Need a lot of time to meander around there's so much variety It's sensory overload. What we did buy was delicious [REVIEW_10] The food is always amazing here! That's really all I have to say. Creative; delicious sandwiches; wonderful fries. Nice service. Do visit; prepare to wait; but it's worth it. [REVIEW_11] Best tempura and teriyaki chicken ever!!! Tempura banana and green tea ice cream the best!!! [REVIEW_12] Couldn't eat because no one would seat me or take order. Here for a conference. People have short lunches. Why understaff? Why no hostess? Why no clear togo process. You are in a conference hotel. Managment or corporate need to address leadership here. Saw food sitting in window just dying. [REVIEW_13] We were happy to discover Luke thanks to the concierge at the Hilton that recommended it. We were hesitant to try it since it was adjacent to the hotel. Shame on us. We quickly discovered that celebrate chef John Besh ran the place and it truly was hopping. Our first visit was for happy hour shortly after we landed in New Orleans. Half price oysters and drinks; you can't go wrong. We quickly reordered another dozen as they were fresh and the sauces ere great. The sazerac was delicious.They have a nice wine and beer list too. We didn't originally order the fries but the table next to us were enjoying them and they looked so good; we had to try. We weren't disappointed. We liked Luke so much that we went back for Christmas day brunch. Equally good. Note that you really need a reservation at any time of the day. It's always busy. They say that you can wait and sit at the bar but it's packed too. If you call and they say that they are fully booked; try opentable; it seems like there are tables hidden away and available. [REVIEW_14] Visiting St. Louis last week & had a lovely time with family at a wedding out in the country. Our last stop before leaving was the Botanical Gardens. We happened on Olio and had a nice chat & refreshment with the staff. They referred us to your establishment for a pastry before we left town. Walked in- stood at the counter & watched 4 staff ignore us- one on the phone; one taking a break? and 2 just talking behind the counter. We really wanted to taste your assortment & take back some treats from your shop- please get your customer service together so people don't feel snubbed. Good luck! [REVIEW_15] We had a wonderful time at Dove Mountain Brewing.  We had 35 people from the Tesla Club of Southern Arizona.  We worked with Manager; Eric Savin; to make this event successful.  The beer and food were wonderful and the staff served it very quickly.  We greatly appreciate all the work that Eric and his staff put in.  A good time was had by all.  Thanks!!",10
92,"[REVIEW_1] Not very good. No salami. Boiled ham instead of baked. No salami. More like a Miami Cuban. This is Tampa. They're in the middle of a Hispanic area so you'd expect they'd do it right. Nope. Never again. [REVIEW_2] Exactly as bougie and casual at the same time as you need it to be. Come with your Gucci bag or in your yoga pants and slam a delicious cocktail or three. [REVIEW_3] This place is a gem in Tucson.  A great place to hang out and meet some locals and University students.  The food is absolutely awesome.  No matter what you what you order you won't go wrong. I love the fish and chips and is what I order 9 out 10 times. Definitely a must try people. [REVIEW_4] When I first walked in; it seemed an ok place but by the time I realized it was a mistake to get mani and pedi done here; it was too late. I got shellac done and they applied 10-12 coats of paint and gel.  It started peeling off in 3-4 days.  My nails look all rough after the nail paint has peeled off. Also; the people working there were talking to each other in Mandarin.  I felt really awkward there. They used some neon green colored massage lotion or something.  Ewww.  I am never going back! [REVIEW_5] Service is terrible; food is ok; location is great (which is why the average yelp review is currently hanging to a mediocre 3 stars).   I've been here many times. It's always about the same. Very convenient; as it's located in Jackson Square. The open window seating is great.   The food is ok; not great; but edible.  The service is where the place needs serious help. One example: I sat at a table (this is a seat yourself type of place); and the table wasn't yet cleaned. The bus boy (old man) was rude about the situation and yelled ""you need to get up and move so I can clean the water on the floor!""  Umm; ok? Maybe you should have a better system for cleaning tables? Or realize that the whole city is a little dirty and a little water on the floor would have gone unnoticed?   Overall; management is the problem. No standard protocol; and not much training for their workers. [REVIEW_6] I have been to many TeX Mex places in my life and was really disappointed in the place. The service was really bad and the did was mediocre bland and not worth trying out. I gave them one star but will not go back. [REVIEW_7] Top 10 worst restaurant experiences of all time!  Stopped in for lunch this Sunday afternoon. I had seen the reviews about bad service here but was driving and figured WTH; let me give it a try. I am sorry i did.   I walk in and the toothpick chewing attendant is sitting on a stool. Sees me but continues to play with his phone. After an awkward 2 min staring contest motions me to 'sit where ever' wave. Brings over a cracked plastic glass with his palm covering and touching the rim of my glass and warm pitcher of water. Ordered boneless Chicken Korma was brought out by a waiter in a small cereal bowl with another small cereal bowl of microwaved rice in which we had his thumb. I wanted to walk out but honestly felt sorry for the guy given the restaurant only had one other party of three dinning on a Sunday Afternoon. Food was horriable. Instead of Chicken Korma i was given what tasted like Chicken Makhni curry over spiced and over salted to look like Chicken Korma. Waiter disappears and emerged with three fingers on a plate plopped it down and disappeared forever. I ate about a quarter of the meal and literally felt like throwing up. The meat was a mixture of white and dark meat left over from thigh or other parts (was odd shaped and some was shredded). Rice quality was good but it was tortured dry in a microwave before it was served. Asked for check. Paid and then told the attendant that i was sorry but meal was not that good. His reply ""Okay...thanks....""   For what i got and what i paid ($13) it was not only a rip off but an insult. Not once did ANYONE come over to ask if everything was ok. Rocky tables were stabilized with folded paper napkins; napkin holders on all tables are MIA. Napkins are just piled on a table with salt shakers to hold them down. How much are plastic glass and napkin holders at Ikea or Restaurant Depot? ts obvious these people don't give a crap about customers and dont have a clue about service. When they do close their doors; they will have no one to blame but themselves! [REVIEW_8] I went to El Camino on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. When I got there we had to wait for a table so me and my date grabbed drinks from the bar. We ordered a pitcher of margarita. The bartender came back to check on us and she couldn't hear me and flipped her head to the side and her hair landed in the pitcher. She said she was going to make another one. She pretended to throw out the liquid in the pitcher and make another one . Instead she walked over to the other bar and just added ice to the pitcher her hair landed in .That was strike one of the afternoon. Then when we were finally seated I ordered the pancho nachos with chicken. They brought it out without the chicken. I tell the waiter. Instead of bring out a fresh nacho they bring out the chicken in a bowl. Service is poor and the quality of goods is not great either. I used to like coming here but know I most likely won't be back again as the standards in customer service and quality of food and drinks has significantly decreased. [REVIEW_9] Good reviews are quite often written by employees to bring in the mass. Unfortunately; true statement and situations; such as mine; are never told due to that unsatisfied and upset customers just prefer to move on and forget their horrific visit. This location needs to greatly improve on food quality. I expressed my opinions to their Corp office and they said that they  would refund (me on a specific day when I received bad food) if I gave them a credit card # over phone or email. I paid cash! Why cc #?! Makes you say hummm! Then after several attempts to get my last visit refunded they finally offered a gift certificate which would be mailed to me. Did I get it you ask?...why; no; of coarse not. All in all; Pita J needs to go away. Liars put a bad taste in anyone's mouth. PJ - your food is sub-par at best. Too many options in area. Go elsewhere. [REVIEW_10] Service has been great both times I've been there. I now crave the ABC burger. Delicious. Save room for a boozy shake. Yum! [REVIEW_11] I have tried nearly every Hilton chain hotel in the Nashville downtown area and am running out of options.  I travel extensively; spending at least 200 nights per year in hotels; with most of those being the Hilton chain.  I've come to expect a certain level of service.  The Garden Inn at Vanderbilt consistently fails to live up to even minimum expectations as have other Hilton chain hotels in the downtown area (Homewood and Doubletree).  Inept and often condescending front desk staff; awful wireless; bland surroundings and generally bad service.  My team and I will be trying a new hotel brand! [REVIEW_12] After a long afternoon of back to school shopping in the mall; I was dreading going in to the Apple Store to deal with my broken iphones.  However; I had such a great experience at this location; I decided to write a review. I've been to many Apple locations from NY to Fl over the years and I can't say the same of my experience.  As busy as they were; I was able to get an appt with the genius bar right away. I had two broken 4S iphones that needed to be looked at but I didn't clarify that I had two devices when I made the appt; Nonetheless; after the  Genius bar tech; Tim; took one of the phones; Guy Schiavi who was on the floor; made sure that the second phone was looked at as well. It was not a simple process as both phones required a thorough diagnosis but I was truly impressed by how patient and accommodating Guy was with us.  He worked on my tween's iphone and he walked her (us) through the process step by step and educated us on new tools on the iphone.  He also provided recommendations on phone accessories for me which I found very useful.  Unfortunately; the first phone (mine) was not fixable but my daughter's phone was fine.  More than anything; it was all about the pleasant experience and the special attention we received from Guy.  I will definitely return to this location for any future Apple needs! [REVIEW_13] Excited to try this new; nice looking burger place in town and finally got a chance eat there - very disappointed. It's it set up as a fast food restaurant; but they charge like a high end operation. Missed the mark by a mile. The burger was expensive; side were severely overpriced. Fries were boring; ordinary and weren't very fresh. The bright spots would be the fried zucchini and the ghost pepper cheese. I will stop at Red Robin next time for better service; better food and better value. [REVIEW_14] Friendly service but the food isn't worth eating. I tried to sample everything to try and find something to at least fill me up for a meal; everything is over cooked to the point where it's hard or rubbery. Ended up just getting a box of cereal. 11.99 each person; would have been better off eating at the sit down spot in silver legacy [REVIEW_15] I LOVE this place. I have dreams about the Bananas Fosters Pancakes. Owners are super sweet and really try to take care of you. Place is small and the line is long so get there very early!",5
93,"[REVIEW_1] Probably one of the WORST experiences I've had in a restaurant :( Let me just start off saying; the food is good! Nothing wrong with any of the food; the chefs are amazing and we all enjoyed our food. The problem was with the service....  We made a reservation for 9 at 7:15 and we ended up getting their around 6:45. We were told we needed to wait because there wasn't enough chefs; which is TOTALLY fine and understandable. Then the woman at the front seats a party of 2 and another party of 3. So I asked why they were able to sit down before our group (and by this time it was about 7-7:10) and she told me because they had a smaller group.... Okay well if we had a reservation wouldn't we be first to sit down? We didn't care if the chef wasn't ready we just wanted to sit down order drinks and have some appetizers. We were then seated and our server Ivan came over very promptly which was nice. After he got our first round of drinks this is where things went down hill.   We ordered some sushi; simple sushi. Salmon; and shrimp. We ordered 2 rolls; a crunch roll and a shrimp tempura roll. He brought out yellowtail; tuna and 2 veggie rolls. I kindly said that the food wasn't ours and that wasn't what we ordered. He told me that it was and that I was wrong. So I asked to see the sushi paper because maybe I marked the wrong thing. And then he said he threw the paper away but he took the sushi away with a HUGE attitude and said he would go try and find the paper. Well our group could see him in the back area and he pulled the paper out of his apron and came over and said oh yeah I guess it was my fault I brought you guys the wrong stuff.... Okay that's what we tried explaining! The stuff finally comes out and tasted perfect! So then some of us ordered the teppan and we got our miso soup and then once that was done we got our salad. None of us had forks and I'm pretty sure maybe 1 out the 9 of us knew how to use chopsticks so I asked for forks and he said yeah no problem. Well we waited out 10 minutes until we saw him again and couldn't find any other servers to ask for their help so we ended up just eating with our fingers. We finally see Ivan and asked for forks again and he said; ""do you honestly need them right now? Your food isn't being cooked!"" EXCUSE ME! I was so furious that he would even come back with such attitude. All of the girls needed forks and so we told him; yes we need them now. I almost got up to go find them myself! Anyways; chef comes; food turned out good and no Ivan to be found for about 30 minutes. So 2 girls in our group asked for boxes; myself included; and it took him about 15 minutes to get them so I ended up eating the last bit of food I was going to take home. So when he brought my box I said; ""I'm sorry; I don't need the box anymore I finished what I was going to take home; but thank you!"" (very politely) He then came back with ""ok well maybe if I take your plate away you'll stop changing your mind"" WHAT IN THE HELL!!!! At this point I was done trying to be nice. After2 and half hours I was so glad to be leaving! Ivan was so rude to ALL of the girls in our group! I hope if we go back; which we probably won't; that Ivan will not be there. I always try and give people the benefit of the doubt and maybe he was having a bad day; but if your day is that bad; don't come into work and be mean and rude to your customers. I work with the public and believe me; it's hard to always please everyone. But it's unacceptable to be rude to people!! [REVIEW_2] The staff is what makes this place great. It is frustrating dealing with the corporate office but Mike always takes care of us. We have had several windshield's replaced here as well as two hard to find side windows on an 84 Toyota. Mike is trustworthy and doesn't take advantage of people and that is worth it's weight in gold. Stop in and talk with them and they will take care of you with kindness and respect. They even do on site repairs and everyone I have dealt with have been great. Keep up the hard work team! [REVIEW_3] Ordered the Korean tacos made from naa bread and meat was very cheap. More than half the meat was fat. Also very little meat overall. Unfortunately did not like my experience. [REVIEW_4] Great pizza and fun place to go to. Love the fact that it's BYOB and the service is very well trained. Enough options to have you torn between a few so be prepared to over indulge. From the perfectly plated antipasto; the house salad;  house-made Caesar; tomato and mozzarella with balsamic; roasted red pepper appetizer and even the MEATBALLS (omg how could I forget about the meatballs and that cheese!) #MustTry  Then the pizza; what can I say it's world-famous. With roots dating back to 1897 how could it not be perfect! Well done; thin crust; fresh mozzarella; and light sauce. The toppings; like they said in the neighborhood back in the day; ""fughetta 'bout it"" Meatball; pepperoni(so good); panachetta(omg); sausage(yes); pesto and more... You can get a calzone with; you guessed it; any of those fillings.   Pasta dishes are new and come with a salad and dessert. Unbeatable for the price up Passyunk Avenue. Go in and check it out; by far my favorite pizza place on the ave.-so unique. [REVIEW_5] The blue version of Razoo; this is a bunch of sweaty tourists who will crowd and probably vomit on you.  Everytime i walk by the place; House of Pain is on:  ""Jump! Jump around! Jump! Jump around!"" [REVIEW_6] Amazing brunch; and fabulous drinks! Staff is wonderful. We will be coming back every time we visit New Orleans. The Crabby Wife was the dish I got; and it was to die for! [REVIEW_7] This place sucks! The one up on oracle and wetmore is where I usually go; however; I moved and the university location is closer. Sorry Silver mine you have lost my business forever.  First; I ordered two sandwiches a large homesteak  with no green onions. I accidentally typed onions instead of peppers that come on the sandwich. These bozos still proceed to put the greens on it and the manager laughs it off like no big deal.  Second; my hot homesteak sandwich was as cold as if had been sitting out for an hour. You guessed right it took an hour to get my food and then the hot sandwich was not wrapped in the proper wrapping to keep it warm. Lastly; the employee got rude with me when I was checking to see what time my order would be done. He proceeded to scold me about how he only got it two minutes ago and it will be done when its done. Not how you talk to a customer buddy!  Goodbye Silver mine! [REVIEW_8] Understaffed; with nonfunctional self service stations for car pickup. Unacceptable wait times to pick up a reserved car. Friendly staff; but painful to hear them making chit chat when you're waiting to get on the road. Better to go elsewhere at STL. [REVIEW_9] Yup everything they say it is. So good. Great service. Amazing food. It can be affordable but when you go there go all out. It's worth it! [REVIEW_10] We wanted to pick up some Zima and a male employee was very nice and said they were sold out and Zima is sold out everywhere in town. So he helped us pick out something he said will be similar but turns out grocery stores and Walmart have Zima. Lies. Oh; and P.S. Mr. Man; Truly Lime and Midori tastes nothing like Zima and Midori so thanks for that too. [REVIEW_11] This restaurant has definitely seen better days.  Pricey; attitude; garish recent redecoration; terrible food.  Too bad; because for years it was a quality; friendly; well-managed place--best in Harahan.  Bring Rodney back! [REVIEW_12] My family's favorite Thai place for any occasion. We have been going there for over 3 years. Great service; food is always delicious. Highly recommend! [REVIEW_13] Both times I have gone to Mojo it has delivered! Danny our server was very attentive and gave us great recommendations; I don't think we would have gotten all we did if he didn't sell everything so well. Every night they have some type of pitcher deal for their drinks which is nice. 25% off a different cocktail pitcher every night is such a great deal! Get the Seared Ahi Tuna; Baked Goat Cheese and Blue Cheese Stuffed Bacon Wrapped Dates!! Those were definitely a favorite between my boyfriend and I. [REVIEW_14] Love this place. Friendly staff; quick service; good music; great atmosphere to work OR hang. My personal go-to is the Fedora Frittata and an iced mocha :) [REVIEW_15] Went there for brunch today. Unfortunately; the person assigned to the omelet station had no idea how to cook AND she was sooooooo slow.  She overcooked every omelet and could not handle a two burner station.",7
94,"[REVIEW_1] Recently moved into their delivery area and called in an order Friday night while my wife and I painted and pulled down wallpaper.  One large specialty pizza was ordered and I was told 30-45 minutes.    Our house is on the same street as their store so no way the driver got lost.  After an hour and a half with no pizza and no call; I called back to cancel the order.  A man answered the phone in the typical ""pick-up or delivery"" fashion.  I stated that I would like to cancel a delivery order I placed more than 90 minutes ago.  Without asking my name; address; or order; he simply said ""okay"" and hung up on me.  Awful customer service!  I never got to try the pizza; but a missed opportunity to gain a new customer in the area.  I won't be giving them another chance. [REVIEW_2] Loved the Bourbon flight! Bartender was attentive; and another bartender offered his opinion on the bourbon when he asked. Very friendly atmosphere. [REVIEW_3] The 5 stars are for the uniqueness of this outdoor place for music; wine and food with a casual vibe. Sitting under the open sky; listening to live music with good wine - the recipe for a perfect evening. I had the kale and canellini soup; grilled fish -both dry good. The steak that my husband had; not that great. The goat milk panna cotta was like mousse and delicious.   The place was packed on a Monday evening at 7pm.   I'd go here pretty frequently if I lived in New Orleans. [REVIEW_4] Ice cream martinis. What more could one want one a Friday night? Their food is good as well. Portions are filling and taste good. The ambience of the place is what really sold it for me. It's a great hangout. [REVIEW_5] The customer service is outstanding and the food was very good. Had the pasta salad with chicken and was very satisfied. Definitely plan to come back and try out some of the lunch specials. One of the best chain restaurant experiences I've had in a while. Big plus it's a locally ran chain!  Update: had the chicken parm with spagetti and it was excellent.  When it comes to italian i prefer traditional and thats just how they make it.  The sauce is very good; they use thr thicker spagetti which i enjoy; and the chicken was made just right; not dry at all.  One of my favorite chains around. [REVIEW_6] Had a wonderful experience today with my daughter and soon to be daughter in law.  Great job Lana and GiGi!.  Absolutely recommend. [REVIEW_7] I had a service associate named Jacob . I came in for a safety and emissions test. I was quoted up to 2 hours.it only took 60 min. From the minute I walked in to the minute I walked out the service and knowledge was impeccable . His findings and suggestions were offered and not pushed. This service makes me want to come back ! Jacob def deserves more than just acknowledgement by corporate and his store. I believe great service (on a Saturday to!!) can be rare to find . [REVIEW_8] Bad service; bad food - just don't.   Besides service being slow (and with a 3 year old that is never a good thing) the food was less than stellar.  I got an egg white omelet that was swimming in oil - greasy beyond being edible.  It took the waiter quite awhile to notice I wasn't eating and when he came over and asked I explained that it was inedible. At that point I didn't even want anything else so he left and left the food on the table.  15 min later he comes back and takes the plate because the chef wanted to see it.  It wasn't until after this that he offered to deduct it from the check.  Meanwhile my daughter spills a full class of apple juice.  I'm using bar napkins to mop it up and had to make several trips to the bar to get more.  Several staff members saw me cleaning the spill off the floor and not one offered to help or get a mop.  On top of that all my daughters chicken was dry and stringy.  She was starving and ate it bathed in ketchup but it was not good.  Thanks but no thanks [REVIEW_9] Gumbo Ya Ya Mmmmmmm smooth creamy dark rue; set along a side of crispy fried oysters they were perfect. Miss Jennifer had Duck spring rolls great as always. As with most eating establishments; the staff can make all the difference. I have been eating at Mr B's long before I could reach the bar. So knowing s good bit of the staff is great. That being said Mr. Dean at the bar is our number one reason to dine at Mr B's. I know; yes the food is excellent. Hehehe. [REVIEW_10] This restaurant is amazing! We went for the first time last week; after hearing great things from family and friends. Delicious coffee; cocktails; and entrees; as well as a friendly staff and owner. Tucson finally has a fantastic breakfast restaurant! [REVIEW_11] Oh my goodness; the cannoli!  Just amazing.  Simply amazing.  There's not much more to say than that. [REVIEW_12] A few years ago I bit into my roasted peppers AND a fish hook. The staff could not have cared less; pretty much insinuating I brought the hook with me to put in their food. They didn't even take the dish off the check; even though I wouldn't eat it or anything else after nearly having my gums impaled. I'll never go back & have advised others to stay away. Not even an apology. I should say there was a lot of blood & they couldn't wait to get me out of there (after paying the full bill). Rude does not even begin to describe that staff. [REVIEW_13] I love this place. our first time here. Cool; young instructors and very friendly. I rented a Jet Ski for 1 hour. it cost $ 135 with all the gears and tax. You get to take Jet ski out by yourself and enjoy up to 55 MPH on the open sea. Although I could not get past 30 MPH due to the waves or I would have flipped over.  they have Kayaks as well. it was $27 for 3 hours of tandem Kayak or $ 10 for 1 hour. + parking cost $ 3 with Validation for the whole day at the Marina. [REVIEW_14] I've been to Baileys Range three times and each time I leave happy and fully satisfied! The food is amazing and the drinks are different and delicious!  The food: the burgers are constantly changing but they always offer something that you'll like. I always go for anything with guacamole and cheese :) oh and the fries; oh wow! So good!! They have several different dipping sauces which is really nice!  The drinks: they have awesome pitchers for a great deal of their lemonades. Boozy lemonade? Who doesn't want booze in their lemonade? The ambiance: the layout is super fun with upstairs and downstairs seating.   Definitely check them out for your burger and fry fix :) [REVIEW_15] This place is unique and amazing; if you have ever been in a Berlin Cafe in Germany this place will bring back memories. I was stationed in Germany and was lucky enough to experience the Berlin Wall coming down.  They have a amazing selection of wine and beer on draft! If you enjoy sauerkraut; potato salad; wurst and schnitzel; this is the place! Please visit little piece of paradise; trust me.  You will be pleasantly surprised.",12
95,"[REVIEW_1] I would not recommend using Alexander Bourne or Patina Shoe Parlor for any service. This ""business man"" is not who or what he claims to be. He is not nice; professional; or reliable. I am baffled at this man's success within the local community; all things come to the light eventually.   My personal headache with this I met the ""proprietor"" out last summer; he was a nice enough guy; we had a bunch of mutual acquaintances. When he told me what he did; as shoe junkie I was happy to support a young local business as I too have a young local business; and strongly believe in supporting young entrepreneurs and craftsmen.   Fast forward to January; when I called to have my shoes picked up; as Patinas had transitioned into a mobile service. Alexander came to my house at 8am to pick up my shoes that needed repair; five pairs (4 heels; one pair of flats). He requested I pay upfront; being that it was early in the morning; we had numerous mutual contacts; and he is a young business with hesitation agreed. Thankfully I wrote a check tragically it was for nearly $250. What I was told I was buying was a six pair sole and heel package; the remaining pair I could call in at any time. A receipt would be emailed to me; and my shoes would be done in 10-14 days. 10 days later I call to inquire about my shoes; they are not ready. Day 14; I get voicemail. Day 20 I get hung up on. This persisted. I sent emails; Facebook messages; texts. I get no response.   Eventually I get a weird and vague communication from Alexander's ""assistant"". Nothing is resolved; and then I am blocked from any means of contacting the business and its owner.   In March 3 months later I run into Alexander; we have a hostile and rude exchange. He proceeded to call me a peon and other nasty names; denying having my shoes. In April I see this individual at another event; he laughs as I walk away knowing good and well what is up. Literally as I am prepping to sue this questionable character calls; yep I was that upset he calls and claims there was a mix up; he indeed has my shoes and will drop them off later that day. I give him my work address via a text and email. No response.   He shows up the next morning; doesn't say a word and shows me the 4 heels he has repaired. The work is not bad; I have had much better work done elsewhere without the drama. I inquire about my gold flats; give a description and am told he would look for them; No apology; no explanation given; nothing.   I get an email asking for the shoes to be described; which I find odd considering that I just did this; and that I would get an apology letter later in the day. In my response I suggest a refund; my other shoes found/returned or replaced; only to be answered with ""I never had your flats; and a link to his website. No apology; no receipt.   Funny; he doesn't have my flats like he didn't have my shoes; like he did not remember who I was in March before he decided I was all these terrible random things; and cursed me out.   The lies; deception and utter disregard for customer service and human decency is too much.  I responded professionally requesting a refund; shoes replacement; receipt; and apology. I got zero response.   This whole exchange was really frustrating; and unprofessional. At this point I am out a pair of flats; it's not the end of the world but it is disappointing. It's unfortunate that someone feels entitled to treat others in this fashion; to deceive and steal.  While I am elated that I have my heels back; the reality the work Bourne did was mediocre and his customer service is HORRIBLE! I will chalk this up as a lesson to be careful who I choose to do business with. Research everyone; and do not use Alexander Bourne or Patina Shoe Parlor for ANY  service. You will be disappointed; ripped off and or treated poorly. Just go elsewhere and save yourself the trouble. [REVIEW_2] STAY AWAY! I am a gold member; so I stay at Hamptons frequently. I have stayed here before; and it seems to be under constant construction. My room was dirty. I came back to give them another chance as it is close to my appointments. I show up for a four night stay; and they send me away because they are booked; but tell me I can come back tomorrow night. Seriously? I couldn't believe that. I wont be back. [REVIEW_3] Stopped simply because it looked cute and had a full parking lot on a Monday afternoon.  The meatloaf sandwich for $9.50 was two meals; and the special 8oz Angus burger was perfectly cooked and flavorful for only $6.  Our side was the prime rib mac and cheese and we shared a 2-4-1 hard cider since happy hour stars at 11am.  Chrissy was our server and you should definitely ask for her.  She knows the menu; she is efficient; keeps the drinks filled and nearly sold us on dessert even though we were just too full.  We will be back again for sure!  Hump day has 1/2 price appetizers too...Check out this local gem! [REVIEW_4] So I was starving  and craving tacos ; I walk in and nobody was there just the workers . I ordered ; paid for it and went home . Those were the worst tacos of my life; this is sad day. My stomach still hurts from the pain I felt and the disappointment. It's sad that  workers today have no pride in what they make . I love tacos so much; I will not return [REVIEW_5] I phoned this restaurant on December 28th and booked a reservation (I thought) for December 29th.  When we arrived at the restaurant; a completely unapologetic; in fact; rude; person informed us that they don't take reservations; and they could not possibly accommodate our party of 5; because they were short-staffed.  He hoped we would come another time; but if we didn't; oh well....  Apparently the ""reservation"" had been taken by an old man who used to own the restaurant; but doesn't anymore.  The disdain we felt from this person; whether head waiter; server; owner (!) will not quickly be forgotten; and we left; vowing never to come back.    I had $200 worth of gift certificates; which I sold at a loss; rather than be reminded of the Parkallen Restaurant.   Incidently; the restaurant had at least 3 tables which could have been arranged to accommodate our party.  They just wanted nothing to do with us.  I understand this restaurant has new ownership - I wish for their failure. It cannot possibly matter whether the food is good or not; when the service is this atrocious. [REVIEW_6] So disappointing. Stopped by for the first time Friday night.  There were 3 people at the bar. The rest of the place was empty.  Sat down; no acknowledgement from the staff.  Went up to the bar and took a menu; still no acknowledgement from the staff.  The guy behind the bar walked right past us to get a bottle of wine for the people at the bar; still no acknowledgement.  Finally after 15 minutes of being invisible; we walked out; and still no acknowledgement. We are new to the neighborhood and are wine drinkers.  We really wanted this to be our new hangout. However; we will look for a place that wants to provide service; where we are happy to spend our money. [REVIEW_7] Great company!!!  I called and they were able to come out same day to change 4 locks at our house.  They were professional; fast and very accomodating.  I had an issue with one of the lock alignments and they immediately sanded it down and fixed it. Overall great experience and highly recommend! [REVIEW_8] Painfully slow. Painful parking (but on state street) nails barely lasted for gel compared to other places. The lady that did my nails could care less about me. A place I won't be back to. Sorry. [REVIEW_9] Completely unprofessional and pathetic. I called last week to get price quotes on a battery and brakes. I spoke to someone very nice- he gave me two quotes; fairly low but close to other shops. I call today to schedule a time to come in and the prick who answers the phone; his name is either Mike or Nick (and quite frankly I don't care what he's called); tells me there is no battery even close to that price. He ""blames"" the quote on me; saying ""I don't know how you came up with that price?"" Then I told him I'd like to speak to someone else and he says ""no; we won't do a battery for that price; so bye-bye"" and he HUNG up the phone. NEVER NEVER call these people. I can go to Walmart before I deal with these assholes. [REVIEW_10] Best damn breakfast I've ever had. We had the roast beef debris biscuit with cheese sauce on top And stuffed French toast. The fruit was the best fruit I've ever seen and the homemade whipped cream on the French toast was out of this world. Fresh squeezed orange juice and a latte for the perfect end to this meal. We will be back! [REVIEW_11] Their salsa was flavorless. To many green peppers in the fijitas compared to the onion and the chicken was dry.  Had to ask for more torrtias because the first ones where dried out. The kid who brought out the food didn't warn is how hot the plates where. My food was just pay. And by the way no Tolet seat in the men's room. [REVIEW_12] Bait and switch! Buyer beware - falsely advertised price!  Went with a friend to check out a used Honda odyssey with an Internet advertised price ($24;999). Friend called the day before to confirm that the car was there and the price before we drove over an hour to get there. We checked out the car it was very nice and we were ready to buy when he dropped the real price on us of $34;600 - a HUGE difference! We could get a new car for that price!  The salesman said sorry that must be a typo but was unapologetic or willing to negotiate. Of course he was willing to show us something else. Stay away from these low sales tactics and spend your money somewhere else! [REVIEW_13] Loved this place! The restaurant is bright and clean and the staff are very friendly and knowledgeable about the cuisine. They make great recommendations and were very attentive. The Dan-Dan noodles are incredible; as well as the dumplings with chili oil. I will definitely be back. [REVIEW_14] I hadn't gotten a haircut anywhere here since moving to the Philly; so I picked Plume after searching on Yelp for something with good reviews  that would fit into my budget.    I was definitely pleased with my choice!  I can be nervous about haircuts; after receiving some bad haircuts from nice salons in the past.  My fears were set aside; as my experience at Plume was great; and I went home with a haircut I felt really good about.   Jenny; the stylist I had; was incredibly friendly and personable; and made sure to talk to me about exactly what I wanted with the new do.  She was honest with me about how the haircut I was envisioning would turn out; and what small changes to my idea might make it a better haircut for me.  But she made it clear that she would cut my hair however I wanted--""I'll shave it all off; if that was what you wanted.""  I could tell that my satisfaction with the haircut was important to the person donning the scissors.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend. [REVIEW_15] The service was Ahmazing! The Meat burrito was delicious and served with great sauce!! The ambiance is real chill! I recommended this place to anyone visiting New Orleans or who lives in the city!",6
96,"[REVIEW_1] Room has carpeting!! Yikes.  Smells awful... I'll go somewhere where I can breathe and not think about all the sweat in the carpeting. [REVIEW_2] Offers ""All you can eat to go"" but follows and tells you what food you can and cannot have without charging extra after paying full price.   Would give No stars if I could. [REVIEW_3] One of the worst service experience. I ordered egg roll and the pho. Egg rolls came out covered with burn crumbles all over and very drak color of the shell and you could the content pretty much black color as if it was almost burned or at the least fried in the last drop of over used burned oil and I could not posssibly put it in my mouth. When I was explaining that Im concerned things are too burned; the owner lady walked up and snatched the plate away from me without saying anything. I did not know if they ate bringing another one or not. Only after I grabbed my waiter later he said they are not making another one ans would take it off my check.  Absolutely rude; not communicating; disrespectful of their customers..  the only reason I came was because the neighboring miss saigoin restaurant was flooded but I think it's worth a wait compared to this place if I want to spend any money for pho and walk out feeling happy :( [REVIEW_4] The ""custom"" program prescribed by the doctor is to put you on a 28-day elimination diet - eliminating eggs; dairy; sugar; grains; legumes; citrus; nightshades and a few other things (certain types of vinegar; etc). I did notice relief of symptoms such as bloating and insomnia during this phase. This phase includes a protein shake and some nutritional supplements made by Xymogen and other reputable companies. Mostly an array of vitamins and amino acids. The rest of the program is basically to recommend a Paleo-style eating program with some additional supplementation. The doctor recommended a formulation to help increase my energy levels (the testing results showed me as having severe adrenal fatigue) which he makes and is a liquid herbal tincture taken under the tongue. Except his office was out of the formulation and it took 10 days to get. When I did get it I used it as directed for the next month and I lost all the sleep benefits I had gained.  I told Dr. Nelson I felt the supplements during the elimination phase seemed to be much better for my body. He poo-pooed that idea and kept the supplements the same but reduced the dosages. I never got back to feeling as good as during the elimination diet phase and slowly lost interest in the program as it wasn't doing anything helpful and is incredibly expensive. The program cost is $6800 paid over six months. While I am glad I tried the program and found some limited success during the elimination diet it is hard to maintain that way of eating while working and traveling; etc. I will try to incorporate a mini 3-day elimination period about once a month though; and do continue to eat primarily grain-free; as I am a big believer in the benefits of avoiding all grain (and legumes). For anyone thinking about this program; in my experience it was not worth anywhere near $6800. I still have some lab tests to do to compare with my original results; but the only thing that was ""wrong"" in my initial labs was adrenal fatigue (which I wasn't surprised by). There are some things the doctor doesn't check for such as Candida and Pyroluria which I would have liked to be included. Also; they really sell the program as a concierge program and encourage you to call or email anytime with questions. My experience was that you got the information by pulling teeth if you got it at all. When I had questions about the lab tests and wondered if the lab tests had included a test for Candida I didn't get a call back from the doctor but rather a call from the office manager telling me she had spoken to the doctor and he said Candida wasn't my issue. I pressed further and she said there was no test for Candida performed in the original labs. So apparently the doctor can just size up your issues without lab tests to back it up. [REVIEW_5] The worst Chicken Parm. Sandwich I've ever eaten. The chicken was dry and flavorless...I have a feeling it was not made that day. They put a ton of red sauce over it (no garlic; very little seasoning ); and small piece of cheese that was barely melted.  I took a few bites because I was hungry and threw the rest out; glad I only got the 6 inch. Would never go back there....blech !!! [REVIEW_6] I just called to place a delivery order and they stated they could not do it. I have to come into the store if I wanted to get food from them. WHAT!!!! [REVIEW_7] I had the WORST experience at this nail salon. I am not a local; visiting SB at the time. My cousin and I went to get our nails done; and I was simple just getting a polish change. The ""technician"" was an older woman; which is fine but she was very rude; unfriendly; sharp; and rough when grabbing my hand. She attempted to paint my nails; but it was pretty awful. It was a quick and sloppy job that she wanted to charge me $10 for. I asked to speak to the manager; just to see if I would get a discount or what; cause I really did not want that lady to re-do her poor job as she was very rude. The manager refused to speak to me face to face; but I could see her in the back. The woman who did my nails became upset very quickly and attempted to grab my hand and force me to let her re-do her first job. It was SO unprofessional; and at this point everyone in the salon was looking at this situation. I just wanted to leave and gave them the money. I have NEVER felt so mistreated at a business; and felt that the manager should have made more of an effort to make sure the customer left somewhat satisfied. I WOULD NOT recommend visiting this salon. [REVIEW_8] Stopped here for lunch on the way to drop some people off at the airport. It's a bit unexpected and a tiny bit off the beaten path on a residential street just behind a business district.  I chose the vegetarian plate and a Greek salad. The salad was the absolute best I've ever had. The cheese was absolutely fresh; the vegetables were fresh and chopped just for the salad; and the dressing and seasoning was perfect. The salad was quite large on its own and could easily make a light lunch by itself.  The vegetarian plate came along with their fresh pita-like bread that is baked fresh every morning; seasoned; pan fried vegetables; rice; and a tzatziki-like sauce drizzled on top. The flavors were astounding; and despite a lack of desire to stuff myself silly; I did anyway. Plenty of food for lunch and very reasonably priced. [REVIEW_9] quite the professional response Caroline.  yes i do have quite a palate. eating off the streets of Manhattan for years makes one quite the critic.  salty=too much freaking salt. do you understand this?  and medium lamb doesn't mean a plate of blood you reject.  grow up and take criticism well; you are a small/ok place-  deal with it. [REVIEW_10] Terrible customer service! Avoid this place. They have a new policy to not help you with any set up of your phone. (My husband called corporate to ask about this policy and they said that they should have helped out.) They sent me home with the wrong instructions for setting up my phone on my own. It's been three weeks since I switched to Verizon and my phone still is not set up correctly. This place is a waste of time and is extremely frustrating . I wish I never switched to Verizon. [REVIEW_11] We got up early on our vacation just to get to Pancake Pantry before the line.  It was well worth it.  The selection of pancake styles is amazing.  I had traditional and my b/f had pecan. Both were wonderful and were complimented perfectly by the salty deliciousness of bacon on the side.  We were told to ask for Mary and truly she was the sweetest waitress alive.    This place is well worth the wait; but you could also get up an hour earlier than normal and beat the crowd! [REVIEW_12] I had not patronized McDonald's in many years as there are many other establishments that actually seem to work for their customers business.   It took over five minutes before one of the four employees asked gruffly if I had been waited on. I placed an order for a #1 meal which is their Big Mac. As I waited for 14 minutes to get my meal several other customers approached the counter  complaining about their order accuracy. I watched as several people had to repeat this process three or more times before getting their order right or they gave up in frustration. No staff member including the English speaking manager/supervisor ever apologized or acknowledged the customers exasperation it gave the assistance if caring at all.   I figured with my long wait that I would at least get a hot fresh meal but apparently my food must have been praised long before my arrival. I received a cold Big Mac that was half unassembled in the box with my side of cold soft fries. Not sure why it took 20 minutes from the time I arrived at the counter until I received my order since the time was obviously not doesn't preparing my food and there were not many other customers in the store.   Lack of employee engagement; lack of empathy and poor or no management seemed to be the order of the day here. How on earth they can keep the doors open with every customer on site complaining and NO response or concern from staff is simply amazing. [REVIEW_13] I am so; so; happy to finally have used the gift certificate I had so that I never have to go back to Everlasting Spa.    I got a gift certificate to go there last December.  It expires this November; so I was trying to use it before it was no longer valid.  With this said; I tried to make an appointment to go since this past Winter.  I was NEVER able to get in.  Seriously; what kind of nail salon doesn't have availability on a random afternoon?  Anyways...  I finally called last week; knowing it would take a while to get an appointment; and I went this afternoon.  My certificate was for a ""signature pedicure; signature facial; and 60 minute massage"".  I really only wanted a manicure and a pedicure; as I didn't want a random facial from this place; so I asked them to please give me a manicure instead of a facial.  It's a win for them; so they went with it.  I was planning to get the massage; but when I got there; I wasn't feeling it (the bad reviews here helped sway my decision) and instead; I was told that ""the pedicure massage will be longer"".  Fine.  Whatever.    I must mention that the ""spa"" is in the back of a store.  There is one manicure station and three pedicure chairs.  In the back of a store...  I repeat.    Upon sitting down for the pedicure; I was told that they would be giving me the manicure at the same time.  I typically get this when a place is super busy and they are trying to save me time...  but I was one of two people in the entire place.  There was no need to double-up on services.  The manicure was terrible.  They used a super coarse file on my nails that had already been soaking in water (bad idea!); and they cut my cuticles without any oil or other softening agent.  When I asked the girl to clean up the polish around the cuticles; I was told that she would ""when she was done"".  Well; it's about 8 hours later; and my nails look like crap...  so I guess she lied.    The girl who did my pedicure was very nice.  But her skills as a pedicure-giver were lacking.  However; in her defense; she may have been distracted by the 5 phone calls she GOT UP TO ANSWER during the course of my pedicure.  Or; possibly the other customer who wanted to pay...  she got up to help them; too.  Once my pedicure was done; I asked if I could dry my toe nails; and one of the women there told me that I didn't need to dry my toes because I was wearing sandals.  Umm...  what?    I will never go back to Everlasting Spa.  I would suggest that you don't go at all...  or if you have a random Groupon or Living Social deal; get your money back from them.  Not worth the trip. [REVIEW_14] They have a lot to learn about service. The male bartender was super apathetic and seemingly annoyed by our existence...ex: when taking our brunch order he just walked up and said ""Food?"" In general he couldn't be bothered to interact with us; let alone do it with any hospitality.   Lousy drinks --  the mimosas are a ripoff. We ordered a carafe; but it was 90% juice; only the neck was topped off w/ sparkling wine. We're not ordering juice here; people; we're ordering drinks! A mimosa should be mostly sparkling and topped w/ juice. I asked if he could add more but his adjustment made no difference. But here's the kicker -- when a friend of the apathetic bartender sat next to us; she was welcomed with smiles and jovial hospitality; and when she ordered a mimosa guess what she got? 90% sparkling wine; topped with juice! You know; the way they're supposed to be made.  Clearly there's no front-of-house manager to oversee and ensure good service.  Food-wise; it's meh. The forgettable $13 & $15 entrees didn't come with sides; so you gotta pay extra to have potatoes or grits or bacon w/ those eggs.  Sorry guys; but New Orleans is a food and hospitality town....You aren't even trying. I don't imagine Morrow's will be around unless you step up your game in a major way. (and writing yourself fake reviews wasn't the solution -- glad Yelp removed them!) [REVIEW_15] Went because we had a Groupon; wouldnt go back again. Granted there was a large table next to us (8 or 9) but we had put our order in before they sat; took over 20 minutes for our appetizers to come out; drinks were never brought to the table nor was bread. Had to ask for silverware and plates to eat the appetizer. We order their special app which consisted of 3 oysters and 4 clams; which were very fresh. The shrimp cocktail that came out was not.  I ordered their seafood platter which was 3 shrimp flounder and a cluster of crab legs. Would have been better if the crab legs werent water logged; the shell had no crispness to it. I honestly opened each leg by tearing the shell like paper.  My wife ordered the softshell crabs which were delicious; but we couldnt finish them because our dishes were cleared.  Total bill came out to 102.00 not worth the wait or the food",2
97,"[REVIEW_1] We had a great 3 course meal.  Or at least it took that long.  50 minutes to be seated even with tables open.  Another hour and a half to complete the meal.  Food was adequate by then they argued about their coupons.  Thumbs down.  Won't be back again.  I wish I could give this zero stars but then it wouldn't count as a review. [REVIEW_2] I used a Groupon for this sushi and i was soooo glad. I really enjoyed the sushi it was super fresh and tasty. When you go try the asparagus and shrimp roll; the caterpillar roll and the spicy mussel roll. You will not be disappointed!  Ohhh yeah cant forget the waitress we had was super sweet and kind! [REVIEW_3] This moving company should never even be in business. Our Apartments had to be renovated their company got the bid. They did such a poor job of packing there was damaged items all over the place they put food and liquids and the electronic items they were not shrink-wrapped!! A ton of my moving boxes were missing  as were a lot of the other tenants  they put things like my personal ladder outside where they left it and the construction company was using it instead of in my house where it should have been becuz it belonged to me... A ton of of my boxes and items were missing and I'm assuming other tenants got them and the same thing happened to other tenants... we were told we had to file a claim and we had to have  proof which whennyou have a bunch of stuff in your in the middle of packing and moving you don't think to take a complete inventory of your items so you're just basically Sol and they probably know that... It's pretty pathetic. It made my move just a wonderful experience!!! extra sarcasm added.. I would say definitely use at your own risk they are not worth it I don't care if they were paid $1000000 or $1 they sucked. The gentleman that came back to help unpack were nice but everything was packed in different boxes like three different rooms were packed in 1/2 box part of 1/4 was packed in one box part of another dark in the same box on and on.. There was no Rhyme or Reason to any of their packing skills... their training was pathetic everything was pathetic.  It was an extremely poor experience frustrating and I would not recommend them to anybody as I said they should not even be in business.  If I would have been able to pack my own stuff I would have had a professional style job done myself... there was no organizational skills with this company... there was no planning nothing. I'm not sure what happened but it was piss poor planning and piss poor execution. Extremely disappointed extremely frustrated and Will NEVER Ever ever recommend this company. I feel our property management company should receive a fulandl refund that wasn't even a job sort of done... I believe they even had an extra apartment that had overflow because all the boxes weren't in the appropriate places as they should have been.  All in all nice is fine..but it dznt cut the mustard. 2 thumbs down definitely !!!!!! It appears they walked but do not talk the talk. This was the first moving company I've ever had to use and it doesn't give me good faith in moving companies. I have an extremely bitter taste in my mouth and it is there for a reason. [REVIEW_4] Mac's is a great place for many things.  They have lots of TV's so its great to watch games; etc. Large beer selection .  Really delicious bar-fare.  They have outside seating which is great for watching the people stroll by and friendly staff!  It's a welcoming place overall. [REVIEW_5] The food was cold and the drinks tasted weird. I believe it is overpriced it's all you can eat buffet but I just got one plate and still had to pay the full price but it's whatever. Definitely not coming back. [REVIEW_6] After moving from LA to Nashville; I was unsure of where to get my hair cut and colored. I found Cindy at Paige Simmons through some mutual friends on Facebook and am so glad that I did! She's not only one of the best stylists I've been to; but also a super awesome chick! i would highly recommend Paige Simmons Salon - everyone is super friendly and helpful. If I hadn't moved back to the West Coast; I would still be going there for all my cut & color needs. [REVIEW_7] Visited here while staying in town at a hotel with my dog. So much better than the dog parks in New York! Beautiful park; kept up nice; clean; beautiful bridge; lovely stream; and fenced in area for doggie play. What more can you ask for? [REVIEW_8] Don't do it.   I brought my VW in for service 3 weeks ago-turns out I needed a new accelerator.  My car sat at Walker for 3.5 weeks before my ""service director"" called to let me know I can pick the car up at my convenience.  Okay; so I pick my car up.  Drive it home.  Go inside to prepare for work.  About an hour later; I go to start my car to begin the drive to work... Car wont start.  I immediately called VW.  They played dumb; but told me to send it back to them.  That was a week ago and am still waiting on a return call regarding the status of my vehicle.  Overall; the customer service sucks; the actual service sucks (and VERY expensive)  What more can I say?  Walker VW can be the kiss of death for your car. [REVIEW_9] Rob Cannon was the DJ for my sister's 50th birthday party and he was fabulous.  I requested Karoake and he played just enough to get everyone who wanted to sing - sing and then started playing dance music.  We never got off the floor.   He did a great job and I would highly recommend.  He made a great party and tremendous party.....Thanks Rob!!! [REVIEW_10] So authentic so fresh and so dang tasty! I order chicken taco and steak taco with chips and salsa. Glad I ordered water because the salsa is on the spicy side [REVIEW_11] This place is a joke. First; we had to go through 3 different people just to place a to-go order even though it wasn't busy. Then we waited 25 minutes for them to make 2 wedge salads. We got no apology. Total BS. [REVIEW_12] Why this place is so awesome I have no idea. Chili cheese etoufee with extra bread is the way to do it. Wanna mix it up? Get a half a half with chili cheese etoufee and something else. No idea why the one in Bloomington is called Dats now. [REVIEW_13] Great gyros and burgers. Probably the best gyro I have ever had in the metro east area. Food is prepared fresh and fast. [REVIEW_14] What a scam!  UPS stores charge $2.50 to 'for use of a computer' to put a USB drive into a computer and 9 cents for the print out.  Even for a UPS label. why would someone pay $2.59 just to print one piece of paper when FedEX/Kinkos and OfficeMax/Office Depot charges 11 cents???  Go elsewhere. [REVIEW_15] This was our second choice after finding out Rio Mar was closed for Mardi Gras week. We had a hell of a time getting here since it was on the other side of the parade from where we were staying.    Nonetheless; we had a great meal.      Service was spot on. Professional but not overbearing or obvious.      A little disappointed that they were out of two ingredients for one of their signature cocktails; but it WAS the day before Mardi Gras.    The bread and butter at the table was excellent. Crunchy outside; soft inside.    The beets salad was so much better and different from similarly named items at other restaurants. The greens literally tasted like they had been picked from a sun warmed field minutes before.     G's Choucroute was a meaty fiesta. He loved it. My crab ravioli was lovely with a delicate Meyer lemon sauce.      Bread pudding for dessert was just how we like it - sans raisins.     Truly a memorable meal. Way better than most hotel restaurants.",9
98,"[REVIEW_1] Service was GREAT! Food....meh. Jambalaya was almost room temperature and no okra at all. Won't be back. [REVIEW_2] Every dam time we come here it's an issue!!! Either the steak isn't cooked right or hair in the plate or a piece of something in the kitchen got in the plate smh I try always giving the benefit of the doubt but this is far beyond that!!! The manager don't even care.. all he said was sorry instead of saying hey we will cook it to your liking or do you want something else instead!!! Nope he just came to the table and said oh sorry and walked away!!!!    His name is Amonte or something like that!!!  I don't mind paying whatever for a good meal but this is ridiculous!!!! The waitress on the hand was awesome!!! [REVIEW_3] These people are so RUDE! I will never go there again! They are not helpful and act as though they are too good to help amateur photographers like me! It will be a cold day in hell before they get another dime from me. They need to remember that they are sales clerks and their role is to help the customer! What a bunch of IDIOTS! [REVIEW_4] I went there once years ago I believe I cut my order down when the employee went from picking up trash to picking up my bagels No glove; not even paper.. I don;t recall all the details; but my immediate thought was it's another establishment that has no concept of hygiene and exploits the lack of oversight..To top it off; the bagels were far from fresh Needless to say; I haven't been back But I realize many people don't care about cleanliness. If that's you; you'll enjoy this place. [REVIEW_5] This review is based purely on my last experience at this place. The employees were extremely rude; and therefore I felt it necessary to write this review.   I am a local; born and raised; and have come here many times. I had friends visiting from out of town and wanted to show them around the funk zone. We stopped in to grab a glass of wine; and two of us decided to use the restroom. Apparently there is a sign on the door that says only person can use the restroom at a time. However; I did not see the sign; which was an honest mistake on my part. My friend and I went into the bathroom together. Less than 30 seconds after going into the restroom; we heard a loud banging on the door. This happened three times during the 2-3 minutes max we were in the restroom. I hadn't even had a chance to wash my hands yet when my friend opened the door to see who was banging on the door; and this very drunk girl comes running in; screaming at us. She proceeded to pull down her pants in front of us and started peeing. I have never seen anything like it. She accused of us of taking too long and causing her to pee on the floor. When we walked outside; we saw a puddle of her pee on the floor. Then an employee came up to us and told us that we shouldn't have been in there together; and we said sorry we didn't know.   We then went back to grab our glasses of wine that we had ordered and tried to find a place to sit. As I was walking through the doorway; a girl bumped into me. It was the girl who peed on the floor. She then called me a racist name and walked outside. We ignored her and decided to stay and let it go. One of my other friends went up to order another glass of wine; and they refused to serve her; telling us that we had been ""kicked out."" When we asked her why; she said it was because there were two of us in the bathroom. Then; a second employee with a British accent came walking over; and said in an EXTREMELY RUDE manner; ""You guys were kicked out a long time ago; I don't know what you are still doing here."" I tried to explain to her that we had no idea we were kicked out; but she wouldn't listen.  Eventually; someone (maybe the manager) else came over; and told us that we had to go because ""we caused a girl to pee on their floor"" because we were in the bathroom too long. We tried to tell them that we were only in the bathroom for a couple of minutes. We weren't even in there long enough for me to wash my hands because this girl was being so disruptive and rude. However; it made no difference. They didn't even give us a chance to explain our side of the story. Meanwhile; they let a racist drunk girl stay even though she was the one who peed on their floor.  And finally; to top it off; when we walked outside; that same girl was out on the sidewalk drinking the wine from this establishment; which is illegal.   Now normally I would never write a bad review. In fact; I have never written one before. However; this was the rudest treatment of any establishment that I have ever seen. It was especially frustrating because I was showing my friends around my town; and to be treated this way was unacceptable. I will never go back to this place; which is sad; because I liked it before this happened. [REVIEW_6] Super nice staff; great service. Always on time and on the ball to put you at ease. Oh; and they never leave me feeling guilty or scolded when I admit I don't floss every day - just a quick word of encouragement. [REVIEW_7] Was not impressed with the store. The employee could care less I walked in and needed some questions answered and it was like I was bothering him that I was there. There are other stores so I will try to utilize the Brandon or valrico one although this one is so close to where I live. It's a shame. [REVIEW_8] I have no complaints about this place food is always good. Everything i have ordered.. jamaican pizza and canadian pizza my favorite. No complaints I found myself going here 2-3 times a week.. lol lasagna special on wednesday is delish too. They run out so make sure to call ahead. Other than that best place to order in that area. Try it you wont be dissapointed! [REVIEW_9] Easy to get ahold of and things taken care of as a potential tenant... impossible to get things taken care of once papers are signed and they get their money. Very disappointing.  Update. Service just keeps getting worse. Unbelievable. [REVIEW_10] Nice stay hotel nicely decorated room OK nice comfortable bed after being out and about; paid $25 to park stated in/out but just used trolley to get around. Located about 4 blocks from Harrah's Casino and Bourbon Street. Breakfast was nice eggs oatmeal biscuits sausage patty; breakfast potatoes; waffles bagels ; evening reception 2 beverages and finger food salsa chips nachos meatballs celery/carrots and hot wings. Soda/coffee available all day  ;popcorn after 2 . Elevator had to be operated by room key and after hour entry plus pool. Pool gym and laundry room located on the 6th floor pool is nice size with jacuzzi . [REVIEW_11] Had to use Glass Doctor twice; in shop and call out; both times work was done professionally; quick and to total satisfaction. What makes it great; on time; great people; and happy customer. Thank you! [REVIEW_12] The best parts about Dewey's are the crust; the wait staff; and the atmosphere. The salads are excellent as well but keep in mind that even the best tasting salads aren't that healthy for you so you may want to research the fat/calories of the salads first. the house salad is good and has the lowest fat grams.  It feels very relaxed in there and as long as you get there before 7pm you should be able to get a table in 10 minutes; after that and there can be a long line. Most of the wait staff are college kids and they work hard for their tips! [REVIEW_13] How can I many ways can I say awful? Let's start with the loud country music on the sound system. The music was annoying  at the level it was set at. I should not have to raise my voice to have a conversation with the person across the table. The decor is a reused wood interior. It reminded me of a wooden cave. Dark and monochromatic. Not attractive.  My wife  ordered the brisket for lunch with mac and cheese and steamed veggies. I ordered the breakfast burger. My wife's entree came with more bbq sauce on the plate than meat. There were 4 skimpy pieces of brisket. It was hard to determine if the brisket was good because of the amount bbq sauce the.meat was swimming in. The bbq sauce tasted as if it was off the shelf KC's Masterpiece or Kraft.  It should have come on the side so the patron could decide how much or little was appropriate for their taste. The mac and cheese was bland and lacked the taste of cheese. Bad bad bad.  The burger I ordered was supposed to be done medium. Instead I got a lump of meat charcoal on a roll. The Sous or chef should be  ashamed of themselves for presenting this in the window for service. This is cooking 101.  The service was painfully slow. I could understand if the place was jumping; but my wife and I were the only food patrons.  Avoid this place. The closing of this place cannot come soon enough. [REVIEW_14] Paid for the $25 wash and detail (the most deluxe package they offer); added leather cleaning for $20. My dog had been in the car while muddy so there was dried dirt on the backseat; which I mentioned. I knew when they called me after only 15 min that it wasn't cleaned well. When I saw it it was obviously that they hadn't cleaned the leather at all. When I said that to the guy he sprayed a towel and literally wiped down the back seat for less than a minute. Didn't clean any other leather on the headrests; doors; console-anywhere. The wipe down on the cup holders; steering column; etc was just as bad. The vacuuming was terrible; didn't get under the mats or the way back. They didn't clean the rims at all even the the package included rim detail and shine. I basically paid $45 for a drive through car wash. [REVIEW_15] Great beer; delicious food. Was pleasantly surprised to find a fruity beer on the menu; and it was raspberry. Wings had good flavor. We couldn't make up our minds on the burgers so we got two and each had a half. I did not want to give up the other half of the Bang Bang burger. It was so damn good! The Fire Starter was no joke. Holy hot! Get the beer battered fries; they're great.",6
99,"[REVIEW_1] Really disappointed. I've been to the Marathon at 18/Spruce and had excellent service; drinks and food. Thought that would transfer to this location - not at all.  To sum it up; our server was extremely energetic; but not in a good way. More like a frantic energy. I was there to enjoy a few drinks and dinner with a friend who was visiting (AKA looking to spend money AKA you will get a larger tip if you let us stay longer) and we were rushed out. Server brought boxes for food we were still eating; without asking if we wanted them. A few minutes later he physically put the food in the boxes at the tableside while mumbling something like ""I don't like food sitting on the table."" .....we didn't even want to take it home. Next; when we said we were having another friend join for another round or two of drinks he told us we couldn't stay at the booth we were at and we needed to go to the bar. What? I point blank asked him if he was kicking us out of the booth and he said ""yes!"" energetically. There was no one waiting for tables and there were numerous open tables/booths around the restaurant. I felt extremely uncomfortable and wanted to leave immediately. Our friend joined after all this happened; and when the server came over to ask if they wanted a drink; he seemed surprised when we told him we were just going to leave. YOU LITERALLY just told us we couldn't sit at this table any longer!! We then left.  I worked in restaurants for a long time and I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to restaurant service. I was not pleased at all during this visit.  On another note; the food was not that great. [REVIEW_2] I find it hard to believe there are so many people with such low standards when it comes to the Daily Bread.  It is a ripoff of St. Louis Bread Co/Panera Bread; which in of itself I don't mind at all.  I have eaten multiple times at the Daily Bread and have yet to have an enjoyable experience.  The food is so-so at best.  Their sandwiches are basic and lack any real flavor.  I also tried the BBQ Chicken pizza and it was okay.    I certainly wouldn't steer anyone away from this place based on the food.  The food is basic and simple; not bad but also nothing great.  My biggest qualm with the Daily Bread is the service.  The majority of the workers seem utterly uninterested in helping out.  There was a line of about 6 people and one person at the register.  There was no sense of urgency to help any of the customers in line.  We waited for a good 5-6 minutes to put an order in.  After receiving our cups to get our drinks we looked for a clean place to sit and eventually settled on a table top that was the least dirty of the tables available.  There were plenty of open spots but it just appeared as though there was lots of trash left behind.  Does anyone bus these tables?  I anticipate that people are responsible for cleaning up after themselves; but it appeared as though the tables hadn't been effectively cleaned in a while.  There was also some trash on the floor that hadn't been addressed as well.  The order number was called and the order was only halfway completed.  When we asked which sandwich was ours; we were basically ignored as the girl put up two more orders.   After another few minutes the rest of the order came up and we began to eat.  I tried both items and as I stated before; both were okay.  The problem is that the food was just unable to make up for the lack of organization; the slow speed at which we were served; or the cleanliness of the restaurant.  After 3 attempts; I'm writing the Daily Bread off and won't return.  I'd rather go to St. Louis Bread Co; get the same level of food; but in a clean environment and a timely setting. [REVIEW_3] Great selection of sandwiches; all fresh and tasty! Also; good salads and cookies!  Nice choice of chips as well; different from your standard fare. [REVIEW_4] Mrs. Ken not only did a great job waxing my brows; but was transparent and consultative too. Before she started waxing she asked me to hold up a mirror; showed me where I had over-tweezed; and advised that I let them grow out. She then showed me exactly where she was going to wax. The waxing itself was much less painful than I had experienced before; and; dare I say; relaxing? Afterwards; she asked me to hold up the mirror again; showed me what she did; and advised me once again to let certain areas grow out for a month before revisiting.  Mrs. Ken is warm; professional; and great at her craft. I am so glad I found her and will only let her touch my brows for as long as I live in the area. [REVIEW_5] I was cleaning out my father's house.  The basement was a mess of junk collected over 50 years.  The 1-800-Got-Junk phone rep said; ""you just sit back and relax and let our people do everything.  You can leave your items where they are and we'll take care of it all.  She then explained the pricing.  The two young guys arrived the next day on time (at the beginning of the 2-hr window).   They surveyed the work; explained the pricing again; and gave me the option to cancel.  They then went about their work quickly and efficiently - and even cleaned and swept when they were done.  It was a bit pricey - but it saved me hours of work and the hassle of dump runs and/or renting a dumpster.  They also told me that they recycle and donate as much as they can.  I highly recommend this company; and would use them again. [REVIEW_6] I stumbled on this adorable local coffee house while waiting for a store to open in the same shopping center. The service was excellent. It's well furnished with both tables and lounge areas; including a small reading book. Cute; cute; cute! And....the coffee is brewed to perfection. [REVIEW_7] I am soooo happy I found Erzuile's Voudou.  I am honestly not even sure how I came across your website but I believe nothing is by chance.  I want to say how amazed I am at the quick and personal response I get when I ask a question about a product.  I have never experienced this type of service with anyone else before.  Really!!  This just goes to show the commitment and desire Erzulie's has to help their clients with whatever situation brings them to their website or store.   I wasn't sure how to approach two major concerns in my life so I spoke with one of the practitioners and she guided me with what to order.    And let me just tell you about the goats milk soap.  THE BEST soap I have ever used!  I just ordered two more bars!! [REVIEW_8] I've been coming here since I was a kid. Always great. Stopped by for lunch and was totally ignored. While I was not in her station Sue took it upon herself to assist me and got my drink order. The waitress I was supposed to have finally came over and asked me what I wanted. I told her I was already being helped and Sue finished the service. I was just about to leave when Sue approached me. Thank you Sue. Now I still have great feelings about this wonderful Florida institution that is Ted Peters. [REVIEW_9] Mike and his people are top notch.  Very competent; used them twice with no issues... fair pricing; fast work.  Highly recommend!   JJ [REVIEW_10] The place is an insult to the Asian cuisine. I love all Asian; but I never had anything like this; It was a  horrible tasteless mess;  loaded with grease and sodium . [REVIEW_11] Well against my better judgement I went back to Freedom Smoke... I was in a bind and needed a tank so I called them first to find out if they had what I was after.   Brandon answered the phone and I explained that I wanted a Pro Tank because I had broken the threads off the base. He said he had some in stock; I then asked what the wait was like. He said they were pretty slow so I pressed on and asked if he thought I could get my tank and some juice in about fifteen minutes; he said more like ten. I was less than a mile away and when I pulled in it was more like 20 minutes just to get my order placed and another ten for my juice to come out. OMG!!! The only good thing to come out of this was they had the tank. The wait was ridiculous and to top it off the Starblast e juice was AWFUL!!!!  Will I finally learn??? [REVIEW_12] Our Lhasa just had puppies on Sunday night.  She was doing great until Thursday; when we noticed her getting a little slow and not wanting to eat.  We decided friday when we both got home from work; to take her in.  This place was the closest and recommend by our vet clinic for emergency service.  They wanted to do a series of test and x-rays.  I was fine with the blood work but really wasn't excited about dosing our poor little girl with radiation for the x-rays.  The Vet told me it was necessary.  So we sucked up the $650 charge and had the work done.    At this time the Vet said there was not an elevated white cell count and that the dog was not dehydrated.  I asked about maybe a course of nursing friendly antibiotics. The vet recommended that we do immediate surgery to extract her uterus.  We did plan on having the dog spayed but this was a big shock.  The poor little dog just had puppies; was nursing and now they wanted to fillet her open! WTF?! How could they possibly think this was a good idea.  Not only that; it was getting a little annoying how every time they recommended something; they would step out and come back with a piece of paper stating they wanted your next paycheck up front.  So we declined the $3;000 emergency surgery; paid our $650 bill and left with a course of antibiotics.  Our little dog is doing just fine.  She had a mild infection but kicked it. Glad we have enough education and experience to have made the most conservative and preservative decision of our dog.    And I won't even get into the story about when we saw the $3000 estimate for surgery and the Vet said that if it was not affordable; some people do choose to euthanize.  I grew up on a ranch; I work emergency medicine; and understand the circle of life; but this place just plain baffled me.  It seemed more like a place that wanted to ring you dry for cash rather than try to help you make the right decision for you and your animal.  We told our regular vet about our experience and she was even pretty taken back about the price of everything.   Will we not return. [REVIEW_13] Excellent customer service. I went in there earlier this afternoon to ask what I thought was a silly question; and the gentleman happily answered my question and got my issue resolved pronto. Such an easy-going experience for these sorts of tasks are refreshing for me; so I'll definitely be going back. [REVIEW_14] I am young; female; and clueless about cars; making me (as others have said) a target for mechanics to unnecessarily sell me on things. At STS; I feel so comfortable. The guys are all honest; courteous; and most importantly; care about their customers. They (attempt) to get me to understand what's going on with my car and work is done in a timely matter. There are many car places within walking distance of my home; but I choose to drive the extra 15 minutes to STS. Also; they always let me know of coupons or mail-in rebates for services. I can't say enough great things. [REVIEW_15] While I was moving in and had all my stuff on my patio the inspector left a note that was threatening : Stating I had inappropriate items on my patio  Trash left out  EXCUSE me but I was moving !!!!!! So I went to the office and a woman named Deborah helped me .. Very condescending .. Acted like I had no right to complain about my note... Then I asked for a copy of my lease.. Oops again ....  We're sorry you can't have that it's under lock and key!!! WHAT!!!!! This volley of info and rudeness continued until she came out and said they were closing the office for the night!! WOW what a difference from my rental I'm Asheville NC.. Friendly clean always remembered who we were even though it was a huge complex.. Ohhh ; they will be friendly when you are looking but once you sign the dotted line ....not so great!!!! You're just a number ; you mean nothing to SENTINAL CORP believe me or they would have a nicer staff and wouldn't have to threaten you when your trying to get all your stuff put away!!!!",9
